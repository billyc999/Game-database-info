 Coin-op fans will instantly recognize this super fast-action arcade-style space shoot-'em-up as Midway's Space Zap. Gamers command a centrally located command fortress capable of firing in any of four directions-- North, East, South and West. From those respective positions at the top, bottom and sides of the playfield emerge alien laser-cannons and the occasional, free-flying mystery ship.      As the contest commences, these enemy intrusions are infrequent, appearing at a leisurely pace and waiting a good while before actually firing. Once a cannon fires its laser torpedo, the missile can be detonated by a burst from the player's fortress, and a second blast will be required to eliminate the cannon itself. Graphics in this Bob Ogdon (of Dave Nutting Associates) creation are crisp and convincing, but it's primary claim as a space action classic is as the world's fastest home blast-'em-up sf videogame. Once the player has gotten the feel of the play mechanic, things really start jumping.      The fortress is soon transformed into a whirling dervish of destruction, spinning crazily and spitting out flaming death. This is not the sort of game that arcaders will find themselves playing compulsively for hours. Wrists give out after about ten minutes of heavy duty action. Play sessions will be brief but intense. The most difficult obstacle players will encounter, aside from weakness of the flesh will be the UFO/mystery ship. Strategically, at all but the highest levels-- where it must be incinerated at the first opportunity-- play a waiting game. As in most space shoot-outs of a linear type (such as Space Invaders, Spacechase and Demon Attack) it's best to let the enemy come to you in preference to actively chasing after him. Sit patiently, but once the enemy strays into range, hesitate not.      Perhaps the most manic space battle of all time, Space Fortress will leave you gasping. But you'll always come back for more.
