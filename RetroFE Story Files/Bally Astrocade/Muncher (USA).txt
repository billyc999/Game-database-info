The goal is continually challenged by four ghosts, One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for MuncherMuncher can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating oneof the four power pills located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Muncher can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghosts' eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Muncher again
