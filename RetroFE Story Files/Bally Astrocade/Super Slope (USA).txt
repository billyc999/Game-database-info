 In this one-player game, the player directs his skier downhill, avoiding pine trees and large rocks by using the joystick to ski left or right across the slope.  A quick tap on the joystick increases the skier's direction from straight to slightly angled; another tap increases the angle further; and another tap will have the skier doing a traverse.  The same holds true for either direction.  Squeezing the trigger will increase the skier's speed.
