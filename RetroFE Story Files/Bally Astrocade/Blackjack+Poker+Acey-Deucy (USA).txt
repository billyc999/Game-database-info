 Three all-time card game favorites! The computer stakes you to a thousand dollars and then it's either "get rich quick" or "down the tubes." Authentic 52 card action! For example, in Blackjack you can double down or split, and five cards under 21 is an automatic winner. The computer does the dealing and keeps track of the money. Up to 4 players.
