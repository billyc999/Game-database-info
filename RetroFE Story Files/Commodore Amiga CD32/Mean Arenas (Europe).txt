 You have entered a game show where you need to collect all gold coins scattered throughout the 22 arenas in order to enter the next one. There are four types of arenas: "Robo Zones", "Dungeon Zones", "Rainbow Zones", and "Starship Zones". Besides the gold coins, each arena is filled with monsters, hazards, and weapons which you must look out for. Use the map to help you locate these.  As you progress through the arenas, there are new challenges which you must face such as multi-level arenas, locked doors and passages, slippery surfaces, and much more. Also scattered throughout the arenas is the letter "B", which when collected will award you a letter that make up the word CREDIT. When you have formed the word, you will be awarded an extra credit. Besides the standard arenas, there are also speed arenas, which are more difficult than the others. The object of these arenas is to get past more obstacles and gather as many coins as you can before the time expires.  In each arena, you will receive messages from time to time, as well as a password, which you can enter to resume that game from that arena.
