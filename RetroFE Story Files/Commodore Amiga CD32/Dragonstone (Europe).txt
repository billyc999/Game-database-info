 The pseudo-sequel to Darkmere, Dragonstone has a look and feel influenced by Zelda, making it stand out from the Dungeon Master-influenced bulk of role-playing games for the Amiga.  Agon is the villain whose hordes you must destroy. The game is split across 7 multi-directional levels, taking in forests and caves in a fantasy setting. You are armed with a sword and a special energy-bolt attack, which can be charged up. Some vanquished enemies discard food or gold; there are shops in which to spend this.
