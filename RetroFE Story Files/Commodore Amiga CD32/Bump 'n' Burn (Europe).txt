 Mario Kart is taken one step further in this racer. The computer racers include Loretta L’Amour, the Buck-Toothed Beavers, and the uncompromising Colonel Carnage, each of which have individual looking cars, varied weapons, and some attempts at humour and pathos.  The courses are quite lengthy, and are laden with hazards and power-ups such as oil slicks and homing missiles. The computer cars appear to be faster when behind you than when in front – strange.  The handling is deliberately arcadey, with fast acceleration and braking as well as the chance to brake and steer at the same time. The graphics are third-person, with a split-screen option, in the grand Mario Kart / OutRun tradition.
