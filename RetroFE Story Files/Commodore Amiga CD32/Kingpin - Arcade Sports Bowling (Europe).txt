 Kingpin: Arcade Sports Bowling is a bowling game with support to 6 players, who can be human or CPU-controlled. Player statistics can be built up as you play  On the the bottom right of the bowling alley screen there is a power gauge that can be altered pressing the Up and Down keyboard arrow keys / joypad buttons. Pressing the Left and Right keys changes the position of your avatar, and hitting Enter / fire makes a small moving arrow appear in the bowling lane. It shows the direction your character will throw the ball when you hit Enter / fire again.
