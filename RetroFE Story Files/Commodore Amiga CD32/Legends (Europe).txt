 An alien race watched the wars on Earth as television shows. After a period of peace threatens the ratings, two alien scientists go back in time on various continents of the planet and start to deploy modern weaponry on them. When they return to the present, Earth is engulfed in chaos. A British scientist discovers the conspiracy and using his new invention, the soul transfer machine, sends a boy called Billy to be incarnated on a native of the different time periods.  Legends is an action-adventure with Zelda-inspired gameplay. The player controls a character pertinent to the time period (an American Indian from 1400 A.D. - America, a knight from medieval England, a Chinese warrior from Imperial China, an Egyptian acolyte from ancient Egypt, and Billy in the alien spaceship).   These characters collect objects and coins to buy items, weapons to fight the enemies and hearts to increase the health bar (located on the top-left of the screen). Pressing 1, 2 and 3 switches between the available weapons. Other characters provide clues and level objectives. Each epoch has bosses to be defeated and mini-games (for example, on the Chinese level there's a race on the Great Wall). After solving each time period, the game displays a password that can be entered at the start on the main screen. There is no form of saving progress while playing the main game.
