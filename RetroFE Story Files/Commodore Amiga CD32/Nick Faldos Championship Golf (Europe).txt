 Arc Developments created a 3D game world called Reality3 for this simulation, licensed around one of Britain's top players. There are two courses, plus a hidden 9-hole course on Mars with reduced gravity, with match play and stroke play options against one of 8 varied-difficulty computer players.  The control system is quite unusual, as the strength of the shot is chosen before you start the swing, but you have to click within a range to activate the shot, and this range is narrower if your shot is intended to be more powerful. An extra click can be made to add wrist snap, which increases the shot's power. The wind calculation is more complicated than most games of the era, and the rough is harder to play out of than usual, as you can't make slight stance adjustments easily.
