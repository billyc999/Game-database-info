 In this game, you play Brian, the lion that closely resembles the Paddle Pop mascot. You must carry out the task of rescuing your friend Chris the Crystal, who has been kidnapped by Geeza the Dragon. His other warped jungle animal friends, Barry the Bear and Graeme the Gorilla, prevent you from getting to him and rescuing your friend.  Your job is to run through each level, destroying enemies that get in your way by either "clawing" them or jumping on their heads. Along the way, collect as many crystals as you can so that you can use them at the shop to buy extra lives, credits, heavenly hit points, jinormous jumps, really raj roars (which also kills enemies), and splendid speed. There are many secret areas in a level, some will take you on a different route other than the one you take when you reach the level exit. However, you must complete certain levels in order to progress further in the game, but you can return to a level that you have completed. You are given enough time to complete the level. If you run out of time before you reach the exit, you will receive no bonus. Furthermore, you do not get to access one of the three bonus levels that you can choose from if you do.
