 Young Cedric is madly in love with the Princess, but he has to prove to the King that he's worthy of her hand, despite his lack of wealth. To do this he must retrieve the King's Sceptre.Cedric takes the basic adventure game elements of object manipulation, puzzle solving, and conversations involving choosing from a range of pre-set sentences. However, it sets them in an arcade platform context. The options are hidden most of the time, and there’s a fair supply of bad guys to be dispatched, either with a sword or by jumping on their heads. There are 11 levels of this to negotiate, with lots of jumps to navigate. Extra lives and improved weapons can be collected along the way.
