 Ocean presents in association with Pringle of Scotland an international open golfing experience. The game features many and varied forms of golf including skins, foursomes, matchplay, strokeplay, practice and fourball with the action taking place over a wide variety of terrain and locations. All of the expected levels of difficulty are also available starting of as an amateur, working through to professional standard and for the few amongst us even master level. The landscape is realistically portrayed in real-time 3D, with bird's eye tracking shots of your strokes giving the player the full story on each and every shot allowing the player to get a better understanding of each course. Also included is the ability to take your character and shot statistics with you on a floppy disc around to your friend's house, invaluable if you want to start off with the correct handicap.
