 Liberation is the sequel to Captive, where the main character from the original is now a free man. However, your character is drawn into action once again after a political assassination and a corporate coverup by BioCorp, one of the ruling multinational companies. With aid from your four droids you are able to search the city for victims, those used in the coverups, of BioCorp. With each minor victory your intent becomes clearer - to persuade the Emperor in regaining control over the corporate hegemony. So Liberation is a very free-range game and, like Captive, you can buy better weapons, from swords to laser-rifles and enhance your droids with new equipment, e.g. numerous head-slots which plug in and give droids different abilities, ultimately driving you closer to the Emperor.
