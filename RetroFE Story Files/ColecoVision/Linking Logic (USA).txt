LINKING LOGIC challenges children to improve their logical reasoning and pluming skills. These skills play a key role in developing a child's ability to approach and solve problems. A child learns to identify different ways to approach a problem. plan actions to be taken. and evaluate the outcome of a solution. In LINKING LOGIC, your child places -tools- along a path to guide Ruddy or Betty down through five floors of a building. Along the way, your child helps the character collect the patterned tiles that are missing from the bottom floor.
