Choplifter is a side-scrolling action/arcade game that puts you in command of an attack chopper.  Your mission: Go behind enemy lines and rescue up to 16 hostages per level.  Be careful, though, because tanks and enemy aircraft will try to stop you -- and they won't stop shooting while you are rescuing those hostages!

Originally released for Apple II home computers, Choplifter was later ported to the arcades and a number of video game consoles.  Many imitators and homages would follow.
