This is a compilation of two classic arcade games on one pack:

1. Asteroids: Pilot a spacecraft and destroy the on-coming asteroids, with a range of different weapons and shields.

2. Missile Command: Command missile launchers and protect the planet from asteroids, space ships and other missiles.

Both are complete remakes of the arcade originals.
