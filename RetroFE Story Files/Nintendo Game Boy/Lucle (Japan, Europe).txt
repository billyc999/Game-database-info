In LUCLE, the player controls a space ship which is stranded on a foreign planet. In order to leave it, it needs to find one energy field per level. The biggest problem is how the ship is built: two round cockpits connected with a stiff rod. One of the cockpits is always fixed while the other one can be rotated around it. By alternating between the two cockpits the ship moves around the level, but of course this makes it harder to navigate tight passages. There are useful power-ups to collect like a compass and obstacles which should not be touched. Each level has to be solved within a time limit and there is no restricted number of lives.
