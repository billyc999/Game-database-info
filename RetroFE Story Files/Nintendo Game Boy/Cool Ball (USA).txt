Pop-Up is a basic action game in which the player takes control over a bouncing ball. The goal of each one-screen level (the background themes progress from the big bang all the way to the future) is simple: bouncing between platforms, collecting as many points as possible and above all the exit key which opens up the way to the next level. Of course there are various hazards to overcome, mostly in the form of special platforms like sticky or angled ones. There are also other tools to collect which can be used to make life easier at other places: water drops for extinguishing fires, a hammer for destroying walls and keys for opening up passages.
