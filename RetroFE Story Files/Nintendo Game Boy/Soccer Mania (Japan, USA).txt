Soccer Mania is a soccer game with cartoon graphics. The game features six teams (Japan, USA, Brazil, England, Germany and France) and the player chooses one of them. The goal is to win a championship by defeating all other five teams, followed by a final match against the All-Star Team. There is only a part of the playfield shown at a time and the rest of the playfield scrolls - the goals are positioned vertically.
