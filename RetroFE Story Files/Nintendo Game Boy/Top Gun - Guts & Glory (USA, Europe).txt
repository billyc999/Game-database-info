Very loosely based on Top Gun movie, the player controls an aircraft through ten different levels, taking out enemy jet fighters and battleships using missiles and machine guns in the legendary F-14 Tomcat, F-117A Stealth, MiG-29 Fulcrum or F-16 Falcon. There are different game modes (Career, Air Combat and Bombing Run). Prior to each mission, players can determine the amount of heat seeking missiles, the difficulty levels and the control scheme. Progress is stored through passwords.
