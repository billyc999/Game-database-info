The Addams Family is a side-scrolling platformer based on the movie of the same name. The player takes the role of Gomez who searches for his missing family members. To find them he has to explore six different parts of the mansion, e.g. the forest or the graveyard, which are basic platform levels: the player moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. In contrast to the other versions of the game he has weapons to his disposal, e.g. a throwing knife. Other differences are a unique level design and another health system: Gomez has five hearts which practically act like a life meter because every hit only takes away a part of a heart.
