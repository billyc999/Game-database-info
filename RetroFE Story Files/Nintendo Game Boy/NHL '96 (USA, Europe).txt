Strap on those helmets and hit the ice for realistic NHL battle. Choose from a complete list of real NHL teams and 1996 rosters, then get set to march toward the Stanley Cup. Compatible with the SNES by the use of the Super Game Boy adapter, NHL 96 lets you play in Regular Season or Playoff modes. New maneuvers include wrist shots and slap shots, but all of the cool moves from previous incarnations of the game return as well. Strategy is key, as you use your wits and reflexes to take down computer opponents or friends. Cool graphics and improved artificial intelligence make this one exciting game.
