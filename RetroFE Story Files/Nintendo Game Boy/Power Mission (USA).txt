Power Mission is a turn-based strategy game set at sea. Both players choose one of five fleets which consist of combinations of eight different units. Different kinds of units have varying attributes like attack strength or range. At the start of a battle, both opponents place their units on their own half of the battlefield. Then, in each turn, they have a certain amount of moves available which can be used to move the units, scout ahead or attack. The position of enemy units is unknown until an own unit is in range and uses its radar. The goal is to completely destroy the enemy fleet. The single-player consists of playing through all eleven maps in order.
