Ren & Stimpy Show: Veediots! for the Game Boy is slightly different from its big brother on the SNES. Game play remains the same with the player alternatively controlling Ren and Stimpy through a series of side-scrolling platform levels.

There's a number of changes made to the original game due to technical constraints. The order of the levels has been changed around and some parts of some levels are missing.
