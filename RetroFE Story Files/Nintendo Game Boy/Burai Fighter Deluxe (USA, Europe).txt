The Burai, a race of evil super-brain aliens, have launched their plan to conquer the universe with their army of half-organic, half-robot creatures - the robo-mutants. It's up to the player to stop them! Strap on your jet pack, and get ready to become the ultimate Burai Fighter.

Burai Fighter Deluxe is an scrolling shooter game with two modes of play. Most levels are side- and vertical-scrolling with pre-designed layouts. A few levels are different, though: top-down perspective, with a randomized layout. Either way, the player is armed with a variety of weapons, including different guns (laser, missile, ring) and the powerful cobalt bomb which kills everything on screen.

Burai Fighter Deluxe is identical to the NES version of Burai Fighter. The "Deluxe" part refers to the added versus multiplayer mode through the link cable functionality that is included with this Game Boy release.
