Captain's log the year 400 billion... Commander Ren Hoek and Cadet Stimpy are on day 675 of a 9999 day mission as they race through the galaxy at fantastic speeds.  Ren goes out to cook hot dogs on the engines and asks Stimpy to open the hatch. Stimpy accidentally cuts his lifeline and the adventure begins.  Cadet Stimpy must first get through a well-armed spaceship in order to rescue Commander Hoek.  

The four levels has you alternate as Ren or Stimpy and all involve jumping across large gaps while dodging bouncing hazards, shooting hazards, falling hazards and the occasional monster.  You grab powdered toast for health.  Occasionally, you will stumble on TV sets where you can watch the muddy mudskipper show and, if you call 2 of 3 coin tosses, you get invincibility.  Stimpy can vomit a projectile furball across the screen, but Ren can only slap his foes.
