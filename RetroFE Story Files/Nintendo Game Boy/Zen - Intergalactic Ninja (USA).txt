Lord Contaminous is trying to destroy the Earth, so it's up to Zen, the intergalactic ninja, to save the day.

Gameplay consists of Zen going through various stages in order to defeat Lord Contaminous. The stages include the oil, smog, dust, and dam areas. These stages can be tackled in any order, before the final stage opens up.

Zen comes equipped with a photon stick he uses to defeat his enemies. He also has the ability to do a slide maneuver as well as a jumping kick. There are also items scattered throughout the stages such as one that can give Zen temporary invincibility or another that can refill a bit of Zen's depleted energy bar.
