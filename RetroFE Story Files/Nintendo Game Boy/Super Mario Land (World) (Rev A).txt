Super Mario Land is the first Game Boy platformer for Mario.

In Super Mario Land you, as Mario, must save Princess Daisy, rather than Princess Toadstool, from her kidnappers, all the while collecting bonuses (mushrooms and plants that will give you the ability to grow and launch fireballs), coins (a hundred of which will grant you an extra life) and move through bizarre lands, battling the evil minions.
