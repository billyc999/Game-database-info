Bart and Lisa Simpson have been sent to the worst summer camp of all time: Camp Deadly.  The camp is run by Ironfist Burns, who is apparently a member of the nefarious Monty Burns' extended family.

Bart must lead the campers to freedom by making his way through several side-scrolling levels.  Bart will make his way through a forest and a camp mess hall and beyond before he reaches freedom. Fortunately, his weapons include spit-wads and boomerangs.
