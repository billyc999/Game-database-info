In this game you play as Daedaleanopus.  Your mission is to solve puzzles.  These puzzles consist of placing shaped pieces into a space and completely filling the area with all the pieces- sort of like Tetris except you try to fill up all the space on the board.  Each puzzle is timed and after every puzzle you get a password so you can continue your game later.
