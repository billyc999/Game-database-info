4-in-1 Funpak: Volume II gives you, like its predecessor, four family-friendly games in one cart. There are some differences, however. First, of course, the selection of games differs. The games are Solitaire, Dominoes, Cribbage and Yacht (using Yahtzee's rules). You can play against the CPU or a second player, using the same Game Boy or, if you have the game link cable, two Game Boys. Unlike the previous cart, there is no skill selection.
