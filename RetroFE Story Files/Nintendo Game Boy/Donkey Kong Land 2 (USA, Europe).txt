Donkey Kong has been captured by the evil Kaptain K. Rool. Diddy and Dixie must make their way through more side-scrolling levels in this Game Boy adventure. Fortunately, they will have plenty of help along the way from their friends.

Like Donkey Kong Land, all the graphics in this game are pre-rendered three dimensional models.  Gameplay is similar also, and consists of much platform jumping and banana collecting.
