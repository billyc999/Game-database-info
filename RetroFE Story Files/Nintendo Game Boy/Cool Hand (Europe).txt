Cool Hand is a game featuring three card games: Black Jack (LA Strip, London, Atlantic City or Downtown LA house rules), Cribbage (6 Card, 7 Card, 6 Card Auction or 7 Card Auction) and Solitaire (Klondike, Elevens, Monte Carlo or Calculation). For each card game there are also a few additional options to set, e.g. the difficulty level for Cribbage or a time limit for solitaire. Besides a detailed in-game explanation of the games and their history, there are no further specialities.
