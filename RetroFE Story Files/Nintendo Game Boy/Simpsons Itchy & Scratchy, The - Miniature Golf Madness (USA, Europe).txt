This unusual title is based on a cartoon within a cartoon:  The Itchy and Scratchy show from The Simpsons.  In each episode of the cartoon, Itchy (a mouse) maims Scratchy (a cat) in some horribly gruesome manner.  In this game, the characters take their aggressions to the mini-golf course.

You have to help Scratchy both score well on the golf course, and avoid Itchy to survive.  The game is played from a side-scrolling perspective, much like a platformer.  To fend off Itchy, you can pick up weapons like a baseball bat, or throwing knives.
