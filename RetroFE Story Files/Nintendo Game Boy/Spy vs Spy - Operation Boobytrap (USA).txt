This entry in the game series based on the Spy vs Spy comic strip series has a similar gameplay premise as the other games of the series, but a different set of levels (overall 20) and scenarios (tropical, lava, ice, cave and pyramid). Another apparent difference is the missing split-screen which normally shows the locations of both spies. The player either takes control of the black or white spy who both have the same goal: finding the five hidden items and reach the exit within the time limit. Additionally a briefcase has to be found in order to hold more than one object at once. Those items are randomly divided over the levels.  The main challenge of the game is to deal with the other spy, mostly by laying out traps. They are either fake chests or special areas in the level, e.g. a cloud can be prepared to hit a spy with a lightning - but they don't differentiate between the agents. A trap can be triggered without taking damage when quick enough. Each spy has a health bar which is lowered by traps, fist fights against the other spy or walking into a level obstacle. Losing energy lowers the speed and ability to jump and eventually leads to death. The spy will re-spawn after a few seconds but loses all collected items.
