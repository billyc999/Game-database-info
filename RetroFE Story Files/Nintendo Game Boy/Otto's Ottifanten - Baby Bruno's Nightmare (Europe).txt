Ottos Ottifanten: Baby Brunos Alptraum is an action game with puzzle elements based on the Ottifants franchise. As the title suggests, the game is set in one of Baby Bruno's nightmares. An evil magician kidnaps Bruno's beloved teddy bear Honk and now Bruno has to cross 128 levels (divided into forest, castle and prison worlds) in order to get Honk back. To beat those isometric levels, Bruno needs to meet conditions like solving puzzles (mostly by pushing things around) or collecting items. There are also various platforming challenges to solve and harmful enemies to avoid. Additionally each level runs on a timer - each second left on the clock when finishing a level rewards bonus points and eventually an extra life.
