High Stakes Gambling is a Vegas style gambling game with a twist - the game takes place in the 1930s and the player's opponents are the Mafia, and they know how to cheat! The player competes against caricatures of actual mobsters in poker and blackjack. The player can purchase cheats in between stages.
