When rumors start to emerge that the feudal lord Takeda Shingen was pronounced dead, the country's biggest enemy Oda Nobunaga became ambitious. He started talking about unifying all of Japan under his leadership.Players need to explore the world map, do quests for the people who live in the towns, find treasure chests in order to become stronger instead of earning experience points and hunt inside caves to destroy major enemies. There is no puzzle solving or currency used in the game; making it more straightforward than the games in The Legend of Zelda series. Most weapons are obtained by killing enemies.
