Skate or Die: Tour de Thrash is a skateboard game with two playing modes. The first, "Retro Rocket Ramp" is almost identical to the ramp mode of Skate or Die 2: The Search for Double Trouble. The player is presented with a half-pipe shown from the side and skates on it. If one of the two sides is reached, stunts can be performed by pressing buttons. Which ones are performed depends on the speed and how long the buttons are pressed - the more dangerous, the more points they award. The goal is to gather as many points as possible in a limited amount of time.  The second mode is called "Stale Fish Tour" which takes the player through championships all over the world. Here the skater is shown from behind and races inside a sustained half-pipe. The player can accelerate, brake, move left and right, jump and duck. The goal is to reach the end of the course within three minutes. There are various obstacles which need to be dodged, e.g. concrete walls - bumping into them (or skating over the borders of the half-pipe) means the loss of valuable time. Sometimes there is an AI skater to deal with. This mode can also be played against another human player.
