Maken Shao is an enhanced remake of Atlus' Dreamcast "first-person slasher"  Maken X.  In the near future, USA and China are the principal powers trying to get total control over the world. A special research laboratory has developed Maken, an ancient weapon that can connect to people's minds and change them. By using Maken's mental powers, the hero can transform into other characters, and it is up to him to decide which side he will join in the conflict.  The PS2 release has updated graphics, the gameplay is now from third person perspective, and an "Image Flare System" was added, that allows you to extract skills from images you obtain thanks to your power.
