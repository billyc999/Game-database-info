It's the world of World Wrestling Entertainment like you have never seen it before. The best wrestlers, out of the usual ring of body slams and into an even bigger ring of rocket fire and engine fumes.  Crush Hour has the WWE crew in their own combat vehicles, in battles of fire power and crazy stunts. The likes of The Rock and the Hardy Boys are represented, each with a varying amount of special attacks, weapons and moves under the hood of their vehicle. Simply dive head long into the battle and be the victor at the end.  Game modes include the simple defeat the enemy style to challenges that have you holding the championship belt for the longest amount of time without blowing up, or taking out the most opponants in the limited amount of time. Multiplayer support is also included.
