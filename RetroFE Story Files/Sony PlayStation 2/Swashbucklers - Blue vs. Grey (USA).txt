Swashbucklers: Blue vs. Grey is an action adventure RPG, offering a chance to take to the high seas as the schizophrenic Captain Abraham Gray. Sail the world and explore towns on your own custom-made pirate ship as you smuggle and plunder your way to riches. Blow your enemy out of the water in naval battles or duel the rival ship captains one-on-one. Yet, beware of the mysterious English ironclad from Liverpool.  Enjoy a variety of weapons ranging from the classic six-shooter and sabers to more exotic inventions such as powder rockets or powerful gatling guns. Swashbucklers: Blue vs. Grey also offers many forms of customization: be it upgrading Captain Abraham Gray's ship into a fortress of defense or the most powerful array of armaments to sail the high seas. Even the Captain himself enjoys earning skills and perks. Skills can be distributed into various options such as fencing, shooting, and defense. Perks offer a chance to create a uniquely styled captain with special melee attacks, superb navigation skills, or a clever trader out for profit.
