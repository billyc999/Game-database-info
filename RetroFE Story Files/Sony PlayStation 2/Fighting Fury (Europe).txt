Fighting Fury is a one on one fighting game, based on the Grappler Baki Anime. The 'Fighting Fury' tournament is a place where the best fighters from different combat techniques come together to battle for victory. There are 13 characters to choose from, and each is skilled in a different fighting style (Karate, Wrestling, Kenpo, Street Fighting etc). Players are able to create their own moves lists by learning moves from the other fighters, and then editing them together to customize their character. The game also features an 'Endorphin Gauge', which will unlock super powerful moves.
