MTV: Music Generator 2 is the sequel to MTV: Music Generator and Music. Like the previous two games it provides the player with an environment to create his own music using samples, riffs, synthesizers and filters. It comes with 10,000 samples and 1200 riffs. Fourteen licensed tracks are included from bands such as Apollo 440, Funkmaster Flex, David Morales and Gorillaz. The game offers to create 3D visualisers to accompany the music.  Creating music consists of adding samples, changing and adding notes, creating chords with a virtual keyboard and add effects such as volume pan envelopes, reverberation and delays. Vocals can be added with a microphone and CDs can be sampled into new songs.
