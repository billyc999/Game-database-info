The legend of cricket makes a welcome come back after years of absence and does it with style. Take part in a World Tour, tournaments and a Challenge mode where you can relive some classic cricketing moments (the graphics even go black and white) like the first Ashes match where England lost back in 1882. Simple controls make the game as pick up and play as you could possibly want so you don't need to be a cricket genius to enjoy the game or understand what's going on.
