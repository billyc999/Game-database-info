The first Harvest Moon game for the PS2 takes a little deviance from all the other games in the series.  The goal this time around is to save your town from being turned into a resort next year.  The game focuses more on relationships than making money - which is the goal in all other Harvest Moon games to date.  You still are running a farm and must succeed in the life of a farmer, but the actual gameplay rewards those who interact with the townspeople over those who just work the fields.
