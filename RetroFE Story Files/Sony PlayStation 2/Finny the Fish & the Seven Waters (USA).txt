It's a fish-eat-fish world in the vast depths of the waters with countless others as predator and fishing humans making life dangerous, but something far more sinister lurks in the deepest fathoms. As an earthquake shakes the very foundations of Finny's home stream, it also shakes the foundations of his fishy life. Now lead by Kappa, the protector of Finny's home, he must travel throughout the vast seas in order to meet the Masters and collect their statues.  One of the most important parts of the game is the hunger meter. Finny must eat fish in order to survive, or else his hunger meter will deplete and he will gradually lose health. He is able to lock onto different fish with a targeting system. He can even eat fish that are larger than him by biting it a certain amount of time. However, he cannot eat lures. In order to escape from fishing humans, he must either break the fishing line or jump out of the water to unhook himself. He'll also need to avoid other dangers such as alligators and electric eels. The game keeps track of what fish he's eaten and what lures he's taken.  Other than that, this game has many puzzles to be solved and people to help. You can collect one item at a time to bring them to people that need them.
