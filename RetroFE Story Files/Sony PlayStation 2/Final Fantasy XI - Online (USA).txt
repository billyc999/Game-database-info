Final Fantasy XI Online is an MMORPG which is played in the online persistent medieval world of Vana'diel.  Create your own character by choosing your race, gender, face, body size and job.  The five unique races are: Hume, Elvaan, Tarutaru, Mithra, and Galka.  Beginning jobs include: Warrior, Monk, Thief, White Mage, Black Mage and Red Mage.  More jobs, such as Bard, Paladin, Beastmaster or Ranger, become available after certain quests are completed.  Players can change their job at any time and can eventually add a "support" job.  Join other players to form "clans" on various servers to fight the evil beastmasters. You can communicate with other players in your group using text and body language.  The North American release includes the Rise of Zilart expansion pack which adds 3 additional jobs: Samurai, Dragoon and Ninja.
