The classic TV game show, now interactive.  The game is played by picking a dollar amount under a category (Let's say "Video Games"), getting presented with an answer ("This user-contributed database contains information about thousands of games."), to which the player who buzzes in first attempts to provide the correct question ("What is MobyGames?").  If the question is correct, the player earns that amount of money; otherwise they lose it.  If they happen to select one of the rare Daily Doubles, the player instead wagers as much of their current earnings as they wish.  In the second round, Double Jeopardy!, dollar values on the board are doubled.  In the third round, Final Jeopardy!, there is only one answer.  After learning the category each player wagers as much of their earnings as they desire.  The player who ends the game with the most money wins.  This version of the game has more than 5,200 answers.  In this version, players can keep a saved profile which keeps track of their name (written by analog stick) as well as statistics on such things as how many answers they've correctly and incorrectly responded to, and the most money they've earned in a game.  As in most console versions of Jeopardy!, players enter their questions by selecting letters with the analog stick or control pad.  After several letters have been picked, it will start presenting options for you to pick to save time.  For instance, typing in KEL may present options such as KELLOG'S or KELSEY GRAMMER.
