This is a 3D-based sequel to Rygar, a Tecmo title which was successful in the arcades and on many home systems.   In the land of Argos, Princess Harmonia is kidnapped by the Titans, who are led by ancient gods Cleopatra and a winged-demon character named Aristotle, in an attempt to release the evil spirit of Cronus. A young gladiator in training named Rygar hears her cries for help, and rushes to her rescue.  Armed with a legendary device called the Diskarmor, Rygar will explore the land of Argos, destroying enemies and powerful demons, while finding items and seeking information to aid him in his search for Princess Harmonia.  Once Rygar has powered up his Diskarmor, it is up to him to stop Cleopatra and Aristotle, save the Princess and all of Argos from evil.
