Skateboard your way through the worlds of Toy Story, Tarzan and The Lion King each including a variety of different levels and locals to visit.  Play as characters from those universes or create your own from scratch. Each included character has their own look, board, moves and collectable. Practice Modes and Freeskate moves provide the opportunity to try things out safely and freely and there are several "pro moves" and level specific moves that can be done.  The game is 3D with a 3rd person perspective (usually behind the player) that uses the game engine from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 and features a custom soundtrack with current bands.
