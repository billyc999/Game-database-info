Anti-Terror Force is a first-person shooter by Dutch development group Davilex following the exploits of the British SAS, the French GIGN and the German GSG9.  As a member of the special operations force of your choice, you will undergo four training exercises - arms, physical training, siege training, and defensive tactics - before being placed into the field to deal with a number of hostage situations.  The sieges, true to Davilex's knack of using real-life locations, all take place in real locations, beginning with 10 Downing Street, and moving along to the French Elysée and the German Kanzleramt.   Although you could be forgiven for believing that this game wants to be realistic looking at the use of real services and real locales, this game makes no claims as such. In fact, arcade action is the order of the day here, and while the real SAS, GIGN and GSG9 are busy with discreet, minimal casualty operations, here you'll be blasting away with aplomb.
