Ace Combat makes its first trip on the Playstation 2. It's real world dog-fighting with a collection of the best fighter jets on the planet including the F-22 Raptor, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-117 Nighthawk, U-2 Dragon Lady, C-130 Hercules and SR-71 Blackbird.   18 missions will take you from search and destroy buildings to one-on-one and all-on-all dog-fighting. Along the way you can upgrade your fighter with defense systems, deadly weapons and much more.
