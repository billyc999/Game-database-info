Put yourself in the driver's seat with Sprint Cars 2: Showdown at Eldora. The game features ten vehicle types on 27 tracks.  Players race against the clock in Time Trial, against friends or the computer in Arcade Mode, or manage their own racing team with Career Mode.  The sequel to Sprint Cars: Road to Knoxville is a dirt track racing game featuring a variety of vehicles including Wingless Sprint, Rally, Pro Stock and Late Models. The sequel is based squarely on the original, but adds new vehicles, tracks, and a Tractor Pull mini-game. The tracks including Knoxville, William's Grove and the game's namesake Eldora and unlike the original, it is exclusive to the PlayStation 2.  In the Career Mode players buy cars, hire drivers, manage parts and scout for sponsors. Winning races (especially accuracy challenges) unlocks new tracks and earn grades. The Time Trial and Tractor Pull modes have an online leaderboard on the game's official website.
