Top Spin is the Xbox's first tennis game, and it's playable over Xbox Live, allowing you to compete in the XSN Sports Network.  Top Spin has a career mode that takes you all over the world.  First you create a player and give him a technical mastery.  Once in the game, you can compete in various tournaments.  There are games, minor pro games, and professional tournaments.  Winning games earns you money and a higher ranking.  Your job is to go from rank one hundred to number one.  You can improve four different statistics; Serve, Backhand, Forehand and Volley.  A higher skill will allow you to make better and harder serves, be more accurate and powerful with your back or forehand, and let you keep the ball in play longer with your volley.  There are also skills you can get, such as Risk and Ace, which improves your chances of hitting a successful risk shot or acing the opponent on a serve.  In Exhibition mode, you can choose a created car or one of several real life pros, such as Pete Sampras or Anna Kournikova.  Over Xbox Live, you can compete with another play, for a one-on-one, or three players for a doubles game.  Stats are recorded and rankings are updated hourly at XSNsports.com.
