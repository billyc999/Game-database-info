The Sims: Bustin' Out is the console sequel to The Sims and the second Sims game to appear on the major consoles. Sims can now leave their house and visit all different kinds of locations.   In the mission-based Bust Out mode, the player starts at Mom's house learning that evil Malcolm Langrabb is repossessing items from all the Sims homes. Your job is to make enough money to buy back all the goods and eventually evict him from his own mansion. The game also features an open-ended Freeplay mode.  Bustin' Out's big new features are the ability to visit and move between houses through the single player progression as well as an online multi-player mode for 2 people on the PS2. The servers for the online mode have since been shut down.
