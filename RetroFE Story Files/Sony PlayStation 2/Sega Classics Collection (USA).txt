Sega Classics Collection contains 10 classic Sega games. These games have been remastered to contain enhanced graphics and sound. This collection contains all-new, polygonal versions of Outrun, Space Harrier, Virtua Racing, Monaco GP, Tant R, Golden Axe, Columns, Fantasy Zone, Bonanza Bros. and Alien Syndrome (which is removed from all European versions, probably to avoid a 16+ or 18+ rating).
