You'll have 5 bloody cases to solve as you play a rookie investigator with the Las Vegas crime lab. The first four ultimately connect together towards solving the 5th. Your co-workers are characters from the CSI television series and voice acting is done by the real actors and actresses from the show.  Choose one of 3 levels of difficulty depending upon how familiar you are with the tv shows (and computer gaming in general). Those modes affect how much interactive help you receive inside the game - not from your co-workers, but by way of hotspots and evidence analysis. The game features a tutorial to help with the interface, which is point and click.  Asking your partner for "hints" detracts points. At the end of each case, Gil Grissom (the boss) will rate your performance as either a rookie, investigator or master. Your objective is to gather enough evidence and information to arrest the culprit(s) and achieve as close to a 100 rating as possible (master). This will unlock "special features" at the end of each case.  Unlike the previous games, the graphics are 3D allowing you a more full view of your environment. Like the earlier games, however, there is still limited exploration of the world around you.  The 3D system does provide the ability to move evidence objects in different angles which helps to locate all available fingerprints and other possible evidence.
