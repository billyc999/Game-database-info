24: The Game is an action-adventure game based on the Fox TV series. Set in between Seasons 2 and 3 of the TV show, the game allows you to play as Jack Bauer, Kim Bauer, Tony Almeida, Michelle Dessler, and Chase Edmunds with all of the actors of the TV show coming back to reprise their roles through voice acting. The game contains many missions ranging from 3rd-person shootouts and sniper missions to puzzles and interrogation sequences. Written by one of the writers for the TV show, it serves as a bridge to cover many of the missing elements from the TV show between the season 2/3 gap.  Playing as the TV show's various characters you’ll take part in a action-adventure experience, shooting your way through terrorists, playing puzzle mini-games where you'll defuse bombs and work with various counter-terrorism unit programs, and even interrogate suspects till they crack and give your the information you want to know. You'll know what it's like to step into the shoes of LA's finest CTU agents as yet another large conspiracy unfolds.
