Pippa Funnell: Ranch Rescue is a single player game based on horse riding.  There's a story to this game featuring a young girl called Lily. A big, bad, banker called Rud Van Guiness tries to seize the family ranch and Lily sets out to stop him by winning prizes with her horses. On the way she meets a number of other characters such as Grant a famous horse whisperer, Liam , and Carla Van Guiness who treats her horses brutally. Lily appears again in another game Imagine: Champion Rider.  The game has Lily winning, caring for, breaking in, training and raising horses from any of these six breeds Merene, Fresian, Anglo-Arabian, French Saddlebred, American Paint Horse and Peruvian Paso. They are trained in the three main equestrian disciplines, show jumping, cross country and steeple chasing. By competing in local competitions Lily gains federation points which later permit her to enter international contests.  The game also contains two mini games, 'Return the Chickens' and 'Return the Sheep'. These are unlocked as the player progresses through the game and, once unlocked, can be played repeatedly.
