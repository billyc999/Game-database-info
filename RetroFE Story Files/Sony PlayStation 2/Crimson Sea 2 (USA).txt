The sequel to "Crimson Sea", this game follows the story of Sho, the protagonist of the first game. In the distant future, a solar system called Theophilus is once again attacked by a mysterious alien race, called "the menace". The brave bounty hunter Sho, who wields a special sword which he can also use as a gun, is determined to put an end to the invasion. During his adventure he encounters a girl named Feanay, who will help him on his journey.  In this action adventure game, you control both Sho and Feanay. Some of the missions can be accessed by both characters, while some are available only to one of them. Feanay uses energy pistols and dual laser swords as weapons. Both Sho and Feanay use the so called "neo-psionics", which are the magic spells of the game. There are also slight role-playing elements in the game. Defeated enemies drop special items that can be later used to upgrade your weapons. You also gain set amounts of experience points after missions.
