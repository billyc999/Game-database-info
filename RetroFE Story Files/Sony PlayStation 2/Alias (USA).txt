Based on the smash hit television show, Alias lets players take on the role of Sydney Bristow, a stealth operative working for the CIA.   A third person action adventure, the game sets the player against two of Bristow's famous enemies from the original series in a plot which takes her from Saudi Arabia to Rio de Janeiro as she aims to find out about a mysterious device known only as 'The Machine.'   The game was devised in conjunction with the writers from the show and used official costumes, character shots and voices, giving the closest experience to playing the game and watching the show ever.  Featuring a mixture of stealth and action gameplay, a unique split screen camera used to deliver tension filled information to the player, and an extensive combat system, Alias joins the ranks of the action stealth genre.
