This is an action and strategy game set in the Star Trek: The Next Generation era.  Players have their choice of six playable races, including the Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Cardassian, Dominion and the Breen forces, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  The major races, no longer concerned with alliances or diplomacy, seek only to conquer planets and systems in order to control the Galaxy.  During their campaign to conquer the Galaxy, players must choose where to mount their offensive and where to hold back and defend.  On their turn, players can build or strengthen fleets, advance and attack nearby systems, and engage in real-time space battles or allow simulation to quickly determine the results.  The game is won when the player has eliminated all enemy races.
