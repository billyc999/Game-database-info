REALPLAY Pool is a pool and snooker game for the PlayStation 2 that makes use of a motion sensitive controller in the shape of a cue stick that is included with the game. You use the cue stick controller just like you would use a normal cue in order to strike the balls ingame. You tilt it up or down for spin and can control how much thrust you apply to the ball. Game modes include practice, exhibition, world tour and multiplayer. Each mode can be played in various types of pool and snooker and in the world tour mode you must play all variants.
