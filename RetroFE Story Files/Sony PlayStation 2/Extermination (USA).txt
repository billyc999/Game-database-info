Something that fits well into the "survival horror" category, this game takes place in a secret military base somewhere in the South Pole. You take control of Dennis Riley, a member of a special forces unit, to investigate the strange happenings at the base which involve a viral outbreak that has caused the base's inhabitants to mutate into hideous monsters.
