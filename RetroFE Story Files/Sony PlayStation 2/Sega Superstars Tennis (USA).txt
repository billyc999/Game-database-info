Sega's many franchises come together for a tennis tournament spanning the varied worlds created by them in the last twenty years. Sixteen characters over fifteen different Sega game series are represented, as are ten different courts based on those same franchises.  Exhibition and Tournament modes are included in the game. The first is a simple vs mode, whereas the tournament allows the player to unlock new characters and courts over a series of matches and other challenges, all related to tennis but also drawing heavily on the video game represented. Singles and doubles can be played by either humans or AI, with the player being able to choose his or her doubles partner.  Version differences are notable, as the Wii game misses out on online play in exchange for three different control modes utilising the Wii Remote (much like in Wii Sports tennis, the Wii Remote and nunchuck or the Classic Controller. Online play is included in the 360 and PS3 versions.  Each character has a special move to aid them with their tennis match, relating to the character. For example, Beat from Jet Set Radio has a power that allows the ball to grind against the net and shoot off at a random point, making it difficult to return.   Minigames are included as both one-offs and part of the tournament. These include a Target-hitting game, The House of the Dead zombie killing game (hit moving zombies around a court before the timer runs out), a Space Harrier game, a Puyo Puyo game, a Virtua Cop game and a Samba De Amigo-related game.
