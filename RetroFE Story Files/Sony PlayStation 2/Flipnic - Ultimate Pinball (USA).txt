A pinball game with multiple twists. Flipnic isn't your basic pinball game, it's a psychedelic trip through fantastic land of pinball. The game features multiple tables in which the player must complete a given set of tasks before she can proceed to the next level. Each of the "tables" consists of many smaller playing areas and every one has some gimmick in them. For example, one must first freeze the waterfall and then destroy the ice and climb a mountain behind it. All this using only the paddles and the ball.
