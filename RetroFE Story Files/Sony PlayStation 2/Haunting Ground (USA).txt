In "Haunting Ground", you play as Fiona Belli, a young girl who has lost her memory. She awakens in a basement of a strange castle, and soon learns that a car accident has taken away the lives of her parents. She is told that the has inherited the castle she found herself in. However, the castle inhabitants are, for various reasons, not very happy to see Fiona as the new owner. Soon she realizes that she must fight for her life, and the only creature she can trust is a dog called Hewey, who will be her faithful companion on her perilous adventure.  "Haunting Ground" is a horror game that centers around avoiding combat and escaping from your enemies. Fiona can fight, but usually she is too weak to defeat her foes in combat, so she will have to run away, to hide, and to use items as distraction until the enemy loses sight of her ans she is able to continue exploring. The most important gameplay tool is your dog. You can issue commands to the dog, telling him to scout a room for you, to warn you of upcoming enemies, to defend you in battle, to pick up items, etc. The dog will obey or disobey you depending on how you develop your relationship with him. If you are nice to the dog, pet him and give him food, he will follow your commands more efficiently.
