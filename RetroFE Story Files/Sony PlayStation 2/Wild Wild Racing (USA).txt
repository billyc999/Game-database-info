Wild Wild Racing was one of the very first games released for the Playstation 2 in the United States. It is a straightforward off-road racing game. You drive one of nine dune buggies in races that take place around the world, in places like the American desert, India, Iceland, Australia or Mexico.  Wild Wild Racing features a championship mode where you compete in a series of races to win a title. It has a challenge mode where you attempt to perform feats such as driving through a stunt course or collecting letters littered across a race course. It also has a time-attack mode.
