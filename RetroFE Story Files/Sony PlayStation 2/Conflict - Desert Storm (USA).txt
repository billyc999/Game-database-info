In Conflict Desert Storm, you control a squad of four soldiers from either the British S.A.S or American Delta Force. The game is set during the first gulf war back in the early 1990s and has ideas borrowed from the book Bravo Two Zero and other real missions from the war.    You are sent behind enemy lines to command a squad of elite commandos, set to destroy key strategic sites in Iraq.  On your team is Bradley, the team leader, Conners, the heavy weapons man, Jones, the explosives and anti-tank expert, and Foley, the team sniper.  Each soldier has different skills which can be built up by killing enemies.  As your troops gain more experience, they will gain ranks and upgrade their skills.  As their skills get better, the more effective they become at doing their job.  For example, Foley will have more stable aiming or Jones will plant C4 faster as their skills increase.  Conflict: Desert Storm is a first person/third person shooter, and each mode can be switched by the press of a button.  You and your team are sent on missions with specific objectives, whether it be to infiltrate a base, destroy a SAM site, or assassinate an opposing general.  You can both control your men individually and send them orders.  Your men can be ordered to attack, retreat, follow, stay, and do many more things.  If the mission requires it, you must drive tanks and jeeps around while your squad mans the guns on the vehicle.  There is also the ability to play up to four player co-op with friends, with each person controlling a soldier in your squad.  At the end of each mission, if you performed well, your men are awarded medals for their bravery.  If you work hard enough, you may even be able to earn the Medal of Honor.
