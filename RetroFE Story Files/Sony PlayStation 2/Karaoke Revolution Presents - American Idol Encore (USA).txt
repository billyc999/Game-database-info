Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol Encore is a sequel to its predecessor.  It still has the main basic features, auditioning for the show as well as performing to become the next American Idol in front of celebrity judges Randy Jackson, Simon Cowell, and Paula Abdul (which was not present in the previous incarnation).  There are also new songs that players can sing and head-to-head against a human player.  Each version is almost identical, sans graphics and controls (the Wii utilizes the Wii remote to navigate menus).  Each version has the ability to customize their character with an assortment of clothing, however the PS3 and PS2 has the ability to use the Eyetoy device to put a 3-D model of the players head into the game or the PS3 can use the Playstation Eye to directly put the player into the game.  Likewise the PS3 and 360 version has online capabilities to download over 140 songs using their respective online providers.
