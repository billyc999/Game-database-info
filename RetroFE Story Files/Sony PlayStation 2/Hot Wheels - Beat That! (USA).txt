In Hot Wheels: Beat That!, the player can take the controls of 30 authentic Hot Wheels cars and compete in 12 different racing environments in a variety of single-player games and multiplayer games.  Players race through enlarged environments, similar to Micro Machines, that include bedrooms and backyards, avoiding obstacles, knocking out competitors, picking up power-ups and complete stunts through a variety of tracks such as the loop-de-loop.  There are standard races along with elimination races where players fire rockets at each other in an attempt to knock each other out of the race.
