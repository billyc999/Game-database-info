Trigger Man is an action game where the main protagonist Trigger Man works for the Coladangelo Family, who is on the brink of a mafia-style war with the rival Montagano Family, which believes Don Coladangelo is responsible of the death of their Don's son. Shown from a third-person perspective players need to visit typical locations such as villas, restaurants and casinos to take down members of the opposing family.  Next to the basic action missions there is some focus on stealth and escorting too. Some sections require a key to be found in order to progress. While fighting, there is a focus on head shots, as enemies can take a lot of bullets in other body parts before going down. There are eight missions in total.  There are different types of weapons including a blade, machine guns and sniper rifles, but only a small amount of clips can be carried. Enemies hardly ever leave anything behind, so ammo crates need to be hunted down.
