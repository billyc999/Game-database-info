The third edition of the beast transforming beat 'em up series includes 12 gameplay modes including the usual arcade, versus and practice along with survival (beat as many opponants as possible before dying) and 8 gameplay modes that can only be played once you unlock them.  The same gameplay style created in the 2 Playstation versions continues here, where your character has the ability to morph into a beast during play to inflict more damage and combos on the enemy. Each arena in the game now has the Dead or Alive 2 style breakable landscapes while the graphics have been improved greatly to use the available power of the PS2.
