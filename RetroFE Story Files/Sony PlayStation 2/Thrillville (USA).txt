Thrillville is an amusement park simulator where you take on the role of the favoured nephew or niece of the eccentric uncle Mortimer, the world-renowned owner of the Thrillville theme park franchise. When uncle Mortimer is indisposed, he lets you take over running of five fabulous parks. The only problem is that Uncle Mortimer's arch nemesis Vernon Garrison is trying to knock Thrillville off the map with his Globo-Joy chain of multi-conglomerate parks and will stop at nothing to crush Thrillville like a bug and become number one. The only way to stop him is to keep the parks running smoothly, this involves keeping the guests happy and finding out their needs and wants.  Created by the team behind RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, the game moves away from pure management for the console systems. You can construct your own rides and test them yourself. Daily chores require you to construct new attractions and stalls, and customers need to be kept happy with reasonable prices.  Instead of crunching numbers, some daily chores have been turned into mini-games based on classic games. Using shoot-em-ups, racing games and rhythm games, mundane tasks become exciting events. You can even participate in the games available for your visitors. Instead of being a god, acting with an invisible hand from the sky, you control a park manager to distribute the work and interact with customers. You can even try to befriend customers through conversations to keep them happy.
