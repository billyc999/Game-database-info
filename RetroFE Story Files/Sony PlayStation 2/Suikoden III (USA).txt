A simple young boy from a small village, a noble knight and heroine of the nation, a mysterious mercenary. Hugo, Chris, and Geddoe - three people, three fates, three points of view. The Trinity Sight System allows you to play the first half of the game from three different perspectives, seeing events from various angles. There is a conflict between the independent nation of Zexen, and the Grassland with its seven villages. Both sides accuse each other of treason and cruelty, and the war seems inevitable - especially when the mighty empire of Harmonia appears on the horizon, with its own interests in the matter. Who is right and who is wrong? Only by playing through the stories of all the three main characters is it possible to understand what is going on.  "Suikoden III" is the third game in Konami's RPG series, which is based on the classic Chinese novel "Shui Hu" - a story about rebellion, friendship, and treason. You control three main parties (up to six people each), and also many other characters, some of them entirely optional. There are three kinds of battles in "Suikoden III": party-based, duel (one on one), and strategic combat, where you move around and control several parties. Party-based combat occupies the larger portion of the game. You can buy and affix magic to your characters, and improve their various skills at your own wish by visiting training and educational centers. Like in both previous games, you can recruit up to 108 characters (Stars of Destiny) and manage your own castle.
