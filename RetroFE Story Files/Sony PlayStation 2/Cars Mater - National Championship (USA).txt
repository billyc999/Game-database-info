Profile: Here you can check/load any of the existing profiles and see how many points you have, the races you have won and the completion percentage you have achieved.  2. Bonus Content: Bonus Content has two options – Characters and Art. In the 1st option you can use the points you have earned to unlock new cars or buy new colours for the ones you already have. The 2nd option allows you to unlock art from the cars, tracks etc. again in exchange for points.  3.
