Dante returns in a prequel to the first Devil May Cry. The story focuses on Dante's back story, mainly why he is feuding with his brother. The game is considered to be the hardest of the series. It has a high production value with grand music, a lush atmosphere, compelling characters, and a visually impressive upgraded graphics engine with lighting and shadow effects. An all-new Style system that allows you to select your fighting style has been incorporated into this game. The game itself is non-stop action up until Dante reaches Hellgate.
