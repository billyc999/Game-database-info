War of the Monsters is a sci-fi melee fighting game. An alien race comes to earth and attacks the earth. Eventually the humans come up with a new technology to destroy the aliens, only to discover that strange liquid from the damaged UFO's stream into different areas, and create monsters to cause more damage to the Earth. Single- or two-player fighting modes are available. The game modes include "Adventure", "Free For all", "Endurance", "Elimination" and Mini-Games. Some modes are only for either one player or two player. The game has saving option after each level and you can load it later. In each battle are health pick-ups, weapon pick-ups like cars, rubble and spears, energy pick-ups and special cubes. Each adventure mode battle awards tokens that can be used to purchase new monster costumes, new arenas and mini-games.
