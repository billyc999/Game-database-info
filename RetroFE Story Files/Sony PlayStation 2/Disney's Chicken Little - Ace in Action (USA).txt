Ace in Action is based off the superhero movie within the movie Disney's Chicken Little. Ace in Action features Ace, Abby, Runt, and Mr Fish, as they fight against Foxy Loxy, Goosey Loosey and their minions.  Ace in Action is a third-person shooter. Battle your way across four worlds, (Pluto, Saturn, Mars, and the Moon) with multiple missions on each planet. Each mission is performed by one of the three main characters: Ace's missions have him running around, Runt's missions have him in a tank, and Abby's missions have her in a hovership. Each character has a main weapon with unlimited ammo, and a secondary weapon with limited ammo. By collecting items, destroying scenery, and completing challenges such as completing the mission fast enough, and finding all bonus objects, the player can collect acorns, which are used as a currency. Between missions, they can be used to buy upgrades for each character, and unlock multiplayer games, concept art and music. Missions can be replayed to get more acorns.
