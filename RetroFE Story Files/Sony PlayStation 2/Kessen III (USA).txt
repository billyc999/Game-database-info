The player takes control of Nobunaga Oda, and unlike in previous two games, you cannot choose side to play on, and Nobunaga has one goal only... to unify the lands and rid his world of misery and suffering. Following the prequels, this game comes with lots of cinematics and stays true to strategic as well as action gameplay, adding a few new things along the road, like collecting items during battles. Two main aspects of this game are planning and engaging in the battle. Planning lets you select your officers and strategically place them on the field of battle, assign commands and issue orders. When on the battle, each of your officers, including Nobunaga, will have his/her army at disposal of which you can take control at any point during the battle. Depending on your troop skills, you can perform special attacks, and your officers level up after each battle and have special abilities of their own to use in battle.
