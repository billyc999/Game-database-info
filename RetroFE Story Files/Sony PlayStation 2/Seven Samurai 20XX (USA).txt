Seven Samurai 20XX is a third-person 3D action game inspired by the greatest samurai tale of all time; Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai. In proper tribute to the masterpiece, the game has involved the cooperation of Kurosawa Production and the late director's son, Hisao, as well as major contributions from world-famous artists such as legendary artist/designer Moebius and Academy Award® winning composer Ryuichi Sakamoto.   Seven Samurai 20XX engages players with an experience that combines intense melee-style samurai combat with an epic story that takes the classic's timeless tale into the future. Players take on the role of the young samurai Natoe to fight an army of mechanical beasts, and ultimately enlist six warriors to help him defend the humans' last city. Using a variety of swordplay styles, Natoe employs numerous single and double katana attacks and an arsenal of moves that grows with his mastery of the samurai way.
