GR 2004 is an update of its predecessor, with more tracks and horses to choose from as well as an revamped camera system along with the betting system from previous games and the same gameplay (pressing buttons at certain times during the race to urge and slow the horse).  It features the same modes from others like exhibition and season mode with the ability for players to breed up too eight different horses at one time in season mode.  It also features a multiplayer tournament for friends to play against each other after each turn.
