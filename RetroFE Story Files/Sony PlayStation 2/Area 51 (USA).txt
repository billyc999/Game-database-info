Area 51, the urban legend, is a U.S. military-controlled base in the Nevada desert, apparently containing a secret aircraft testing facility. It is also famed as the subject of many UFO conspiracy theories. Area 51, the game, is a FPS set in this particular base, now infested with rampant aliens and a mutagenic virus that changes your character. As Ethan Cole, Special Forces, specialist of HAZMAT (hazardous materials) Division, you will have to discover what's going on inside the base and blast the menace to save the world.  As a First-Person Shooter, the hero will have access to more than 10 types of human and alien weapons to fight the creatures, designed by Stan Winston Studios, monster creator for such films as Aliens, Jurassic Park and Predator.   Your character will have to race against time: the same virus that is mutating the facility personnel into monsters is also in your organism, slowly transforming him in a inhuman creature under the control of the alien masterminds.
