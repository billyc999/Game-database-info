NPPL Championship Paintball 2009 is a first-person paintball game that features real life tournament locations and official branded paintball gear. Players can choose between different professional playballers, with different statistics, and teams. In the career mode a character starts as a division 2 competitor and by winning matches credits are earned to upgrade gear and equipment. Attributes that can be upgraded, with a maximum of 40, are speed, accuracy, communication, marker handling and reload.  The game also includes the ability to create your own field. Along with single-player modes, including capture-the-flag, there is online multiplayer for up to fourteen players. The game also features over 35 tournaments with regulation professional paintball field layouts. In the Exhibition Mode, Woodsball can be played next to Speedball. It includes an option to cheat by attempting to wipe a hit. This is done by timing a swinging bar in a cheat meter.
