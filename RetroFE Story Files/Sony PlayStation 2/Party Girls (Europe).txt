If you ever watched any of the games without limits show, this may strike you as if one of them got made into a video game with a difference that each game requires two and only two competitors. Games you can compete at in this game are all watter connected if only for the fact all the contestants (and they're all women) here wear swimsuits. Each competition consists of five mini-games and you must win all five in order to win. After you win, you get extras, though (think swimsuits). You can play versus another player or CPU in games which vary from backward facing butt-kicking each other to fall into water, rubbing thermometer to reach the required temperature first, spreading legs as far as possible without falling into water, swimming, selecting the right wig to wear, jumping over the water, and more. So, select one of the ten contestants: Ayano Seto, Yuuka Mizuki, Ryouko Tachibana, Minako Sakurai, Arisu Kagura, Riho Futaba, Kana Momozono, Miyu Amagi, Reiko Mizusaki, or Kyouko Mizusaki, and try to be the top girl at this swim meet.
