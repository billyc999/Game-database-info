SingStar ABBA is a karaoke game featuring songs from the Swedish group ABBA. The group was active during the seventies, particularly in the disco/pop music.  The game gives points which are distributed by the purity of singing, as in how well does one manage to stay on tune. It doesn't matter if you change octaves in the middle of the song or what words are you singing in (it doesn't have a word recognition), so your singing is rated by how well you manage to hit the correct note at the correct time.  Here is the tracklist (5 songs are exclusive to the PS3):  1. Chiquitita 2. Dancing Queen 3. Does Your Mother Know 4. Fernando 5. Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight) 6. Happy New Year” (PS3 Exclusive) 7. Head Over Heels (PS3 Exclusive) 8. I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do 9. Knowing Me, Knowing You 10. Mamma Mia 11. Money, Money, Money 12. One Of Us 13. Ring Ring 14.
