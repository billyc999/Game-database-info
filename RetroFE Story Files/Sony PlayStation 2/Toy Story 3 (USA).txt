The toys are back in town and at last they've got a video game to equal the brilliance of the movies. You can relieve the story from the new film if you want, but there's much more to this game than the usual film tie-in.  The best bit of this game is the exclusive Toy Box mode, where you can play as Woody, Buzz or Jessie in the role of Sheriff in a toyland town. This mode uses all the same characters from the films but gives you complete freedom to play with all of them however you want - from exciting car (or horse and dragon) races to catching ghosts.   One special element of the Toy Box is magic goo that can change the size of any of the characters, which together with all the other collectable objects lets you completely customise the town, and the world of Toy Story, however you want.
