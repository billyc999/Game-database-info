Harvard professor Robert Langdon is in Paris for a meeting with a curator of the Louvre. When he arrives, it turns out the curator is dead. With his own blood, he has written a cryptic message. French cryptographer Sophie Neveu arrives and they team up to solve the murder and discover that Leonardo Da Vinci has left clues to a secret in his paintings. This leads them to uncover a millennia-old conspiracy. A secret society tries to stop them from doing so.
