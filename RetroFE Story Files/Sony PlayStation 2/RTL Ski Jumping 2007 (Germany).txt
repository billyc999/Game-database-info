RTL Ski Jumping  2007 a simulation of the ski jumping sport. The handling is quite simple: the player uses the mouse to hold a steady course and clicks at the right moment to jump respectively land. In the career mode the player creates his own athlete who starts in the amateur league. For successful competitions he receives prize money and experience points which he reinvests into better coaches or equipment respectively better character statistics, e.g. landing technique.

The game features a optional technique analysis after every jump which shows potential points of improvement and challenges in the career mode which unlock special pieces of equipment, e.g. a perfect landing. There is also a quiz game with a few hundred questions about ski jumping.  In comparison to the 2006 version there are a few small improvements, e.g. a overhauled menu system, new graphics effects and two new camera perspectives. Also new is that the player additionally controls the balance during the braking after the landing and if the player character shows cheering or depressed gestures. The license is restricted to the 41 jumping sites and the equipment.
