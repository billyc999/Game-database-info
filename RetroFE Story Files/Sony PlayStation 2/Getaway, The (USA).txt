Mark Hammond is an ex-gangster accused in murdering his wife. His child has been kidnapped. Frank Carter is a vigilante cop who won't stop until he gets justice. Both men share the same goal: to bring down London's most vicious criminal, the mafia boss Charlie Jolson. However, it won't be easy, because Jolson can find ways to manipulate people and to take them under his control...  The game is split in two large parts. Once you complete Mark's part, you get to play as Carter. You play the same story, but view it from two different angles. Some events that look vague when played from Mark's side get explained when controlling Carter.  The gameplay is divided into driving and shooting/sneaking parts. Usually you receive a mission, drive to a certain destination, and then shoot (or sometimes sneak) your way to the goal. London has been digitally recreated for this game, and you can drive through it freely (unless your mission is timed, which happens often). As Mark, you'll have to avoid police and rivaling gangs chasing you. You can hijack cars and even buses. You can also leave a car at any time and run through London on foot. For the shooting parts, there is a variety of moves you can perform: sneaking, hiding, crouching, rolling to the sides, etc. You can knock your enemies down by using your gun's butt as a melee weapon or take pedestrians hostage to prevent the policemen from killing you.
