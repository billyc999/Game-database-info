Get On Da Mic is a karaoke game based exclusively on Hip-Hop songs. Players have to sing along with the songs as a version plays sung by an amateur singer and the lyrics scroll along on the screen. The singer's voice is adapted based on the player's timing, pitch is not taken into account. The songs are not sung by the original performers, but re-recorded. Scoring is based on the overall timing of the words. The words do not have to be sung correctly. It also registers when random noises are made as long as the timing is correct. As it mostly consists of rap songs, there is a bar and spacing between the words to provide help with the lyrical flow, along with a moving color highlighting the words. Songs can be sung in three difficulty levels. When performing well, a meter is filled up until the rock the mic sequence is activated, adding snow to the location or money falling from the sky.  In the main career mode the player has to make his way up to sing in better venues (starting in the bathroom) with eleven in total. Money earned along the way can be spent on items to customize the character or to buy a mansion and decorate it. Other modes are exhibition (sing any song) and practice (similar to exhibition but without scoring). In the freestyle mode players can rap freely over the beats without the regular vocals. There is also a multiplayer freestyle mode where another player uses the controller to judge the freestyle. There are different characters to choose from, each with their own poses and animations.
