EyeToy: Play 3 contains a set of over 50 different games you can play with the help of a USB camera connected to Playstation 2. Amount of players can vary from 1-4 players and the game is suitable for people of all ages.  EyeToy: Play 3 provides single player challenges such as Ghost Grab where you enter a ghost house and try to catch ghosts while trying to avoid objects thrown at you and Boot Camp where you try to pass the different challenges thrown at you such as running through an obstacle course or following sergeants orders. Additionally, for someone preferring slightly less intense action, there is music conducting and working in a beauty salon.   However when two or more players are included many more games open in party mode such as Monkey Rampage, Kitty Loves Me and Athletics, with bowling, American football and such. These party games are fast-paced and usually all 4-players can play on the screen at the same time.
