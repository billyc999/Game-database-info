Tidus is a young athlete who lives in a futuristic city of Zanarkand - the "city that never sleeps". He plays blitzball, a ball game where players throw the ball while flying around. Suddenly, a terrible disaster happens. A huge dark wave engulfs the city, spawning monsters. Tidus comes in contact with the mysterious creature, and as a result finds himself in a different world, 1000 years into the future. The civilization he is used to doesn't exist any more. He learns that the world he knew was destroyed by Sin, a terrible being that is believed to be indestructible. Tidus meets a young summoner named Yuna, and joins her as a guardian on her quest to put an end to Sin.  Final Fantasy X is set in a world that is somewhat similar to South Asia. The game doesn't use the traditional level up system: instead, you receive sphere points after battles, and then upgrade your characters' parameters while moving on a special sphere map. The ATB (active time battle) system is replaced by turn-based combat. The characters are given distinct class attributes, and you can switch between all your party members during the same battle. Summoned monsters (called aeons in the game) now behave like playable characters, have their own HP, and can fight for the party until defeated.
