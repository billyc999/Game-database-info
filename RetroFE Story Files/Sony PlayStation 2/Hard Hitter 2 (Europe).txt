Hard Hitter 2 challenges you to become the best in the world. Choose one of 14 athletes or make your own, and grow your character's stats over the course of a year. Playing well during the game will increase the mentality meter, giving your player a better chance of making tough shots. The mentality meter can also be expended to make a shot that will be difficult to hit back. Whichever player has won the most money from tournaments by the end of the year is crowned champion.  Also included is a multiplayer mode for up to four players and a minigame mode where the player must either hit specific targets to spell out words, or hit a number of targets with a limited number of balls.
