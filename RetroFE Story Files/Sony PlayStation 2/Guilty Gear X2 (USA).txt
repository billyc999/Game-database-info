In Guilty Gear X2, 6 new characters join the list of 14 from the previous Guilty Gear series for an all out brawl of extreme 2D martial arts, magic and huge combos.  Along with the usual training and story modes, GGX2 includes Medal of Millionaires, where each battle earns you medals and points instead of simple wins. Mission mode has you completing certain objectives for each fight in order to continue, while Survival and 2 player head to head modes round out the options.
