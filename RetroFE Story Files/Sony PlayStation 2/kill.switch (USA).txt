An innovative third person shooter that makes heavy use of a 'cover system'.  This allows the player to 'attach' to objects so that they can fire at the enemy from a safe position.      Basically you are some sort of enhanced soldier with no memory of who or where you came from.  The story unfolds over the course of fifteen missions, spanning 5 levels, and through FMV cinematics.    At first you'll cause all sorts of mayhem in various global hotspots, but as the past is made clear, the real enemy and their ultimate objective will be revealed.
