Take Crazy Frog, known from the ring tone, and a bunch of his friends and enemies in crazy kart-style races around 12 tracks in 4 cups (baby, funny, crazy and special), and collect the crazy power-ups. Hopefully you like his trademark sounds because you'll hear them quite often. You can play with 4 friends in 3 different multiplayer modes: championship, single race or a battle. Aside from Crazy Frog, you can choose Ninja Gorilla (Bobo), Matilda the Cow, Ellie the Fairy, the Gangsta kids (Flash, Grim and Jack), Mad French Chef (Michel) and Drone.  During the races, you can collect coins to accumulate and drop hazards, such as mines, rockets or boosts. The main singleplayer game modes include championship, single race, time trial and chase. In the options screen, you can listen to 12 Crazy Frog songs on a jukebox.
