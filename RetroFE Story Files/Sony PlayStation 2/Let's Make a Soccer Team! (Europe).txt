Doing exactly what it says in the title, Let's Make a Soccer Team! starts with the player creating his own football team. At the start, the player chooses one of the six leagues, the region,  hometown and colours of the club, as well as their characteristic playing style and the club secretary, which will guide the player. through the most basic features. Additional features (such as designing the club kits and logo) are unlocked as the player advances.  At the start of the game, the player learns the backstory of the club - established 15 years ago, it quickly rose through the amateur divisions, but at an enormous expense - it's the end of the season, and to reach the second division the team has made a huge effort signing players, and while they're in the promotion playoffs, the club is broke, and the only way to survive is to reach the second division. To make things worse, a local tycoon is eyeing a club to buy, and the nearly bankrupt club might be the easiest target...  While the presentation is a lot different from other managers (excluding, perhaps, the ZOO Digital rehash of Premier Manager) due to the extensive use of 3D characters and models in the menus, as well as featuring some story elements, it features the same options as other managers in the market, featuring player and staff signing, team tactics and training, but also financial decisions like sponsoring and stadium and facility improvement.
