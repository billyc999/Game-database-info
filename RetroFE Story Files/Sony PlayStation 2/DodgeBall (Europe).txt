Dodgeball is a team dodgeball game. First team to get the other team out is the winner, be it through the one-shot system or a "life system" where the object is to lower the opposition's players health to zero. If both teams are still in by the end of the game, the team with the most players wins the game. If teams have an equal amount of players left then the team with the least damage taken wins. If equal damage has been taken by either team then the game ends in a tie.  Play as one of six teams who each represent a certain country, spearheaded by a figure from history or national folklore - Japan (Nobunaga), Germany (Bach), Greece (Pythagoras), Norway (King Harald I), Great Britain (King Arthur) and the United States of America (Wyatt Earp). There are three other teams to unlock as the game progresses.  Either play through the single-player World Tournament to become Dodgeball World Champion, play against a friend in a Team Battle, or team up with up to three friends for a Multi-Player Battle against the computer.
