Outlaw Volleyball: Remixed is a port of Outlaw Volleyball.  It includes all the content of the Xbox version, plus two new courts and several extra costumes and accessories for the characters.  Outlaw Volleyball: Remixed is an anarchic take on the sport with stereotypical characters like a Scottish Soccer Hooligan, a vain Latin lover and a British punk.  Character's performance is determined partially by a momentum meter, which is filled by beating up members of the opposing team.  The fighting segments play something like a simplified version of Tekken.
