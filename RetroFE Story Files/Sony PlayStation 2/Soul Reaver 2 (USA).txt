Following the events in Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, Raziel discovers a way back through time and encounters one of the Circle of the Nine, Mobius the timestreamer. Mobius urges Raziel to continue his quest for revenge and destroy the vampiric Kain. Raziel reluctantly agrees and heads off to discover the knowledge and weapons that will allow him to achieve his goal.  Soul Reaver 2 is a 3rd person adventure game, like the first game. The player controls the game from behind Raziel's shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, swimming, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel can grip onto the sides of ledges, climb walls and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. Raziel can shift through the "material" world into the "spectral" realm at will... but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel's life energy at a constant rate. Raziel must restore energy by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. Raziel no longer gains abilities from absorbing great souls and instead must imbue his Soul Reaver weapon by activating certain elemental temples. Once activated, various "elemental fonts" can be used to charge the Soul Reaver to specific attributes. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of other weapons including daggers, swords, axes, spears as well as the Soul Reaver and bare-handed claws.  Unlike the previous game, Soul Reaver 2 is linear and follows specific paths through different areas. Raziel cannot return to certain areas once he has left them behind. Soul Reaver 2 features a variety of different puzzles, often involving blocks or manipulation of different devices. One common theme is "light puzzles" where Raziel must reflect light, using mirrored objects, so that they touch switches or objects which require activation.
