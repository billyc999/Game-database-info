Bully is a story of one Jimmy Hopkins, whose academic success hasn't been anything spectacular as he's been expelled from various schools. His parents have a grand idea of sending him to Bullworth Academy which -- despite its grand name -- houses lots of other kids like Jimmy. This is the place where future dictators, murderers, and mad scientists reside. With a help of a few friends, some wits and hard-as-a-rock fists, Jimmy has to survive through one year in Bullworth Academy.  The game is very open which means the player can choose to do missions or some of the other activities the academy and its surrounding town of Bullworth has to offer. Minigames, collectible stuff, racing, doing odd jobs to earn money, and so on.
