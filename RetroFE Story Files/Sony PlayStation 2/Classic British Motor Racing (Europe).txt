This is a racing game featuring British cars from the 60's. There are 13 cars available: Austin Mini Cooper, MGA MKII, MGB MKI, Austin Healey 3000, MG Midget, Triumph Spitfire, Triumph TR2, Riley RM, Triumph TR2 A, Rover P6, Triumph TR5, Triumph TR6 and a secret car to be unlocked after qualifying with the 12 first cars.  The game features three gameplay modes: Single Race, Time Trials and Challenge. In order to play the Single Race and Challenge modes, the player has to unlock cars racing one lap in any circuit in the Time Trials mode, within the time limit. Once the cars are unlocked, they'll be available in the other two play modes, with three different painting options.  The Single Race mode, as the name implies, lets the player chose any of the unlocked cars and race against 7 other competitors in any course of choice. There are 6 circuits available: Scottish Highlands, Rooksley Forest, Greenwood County, Foxglove Lane, Westminster Run and London City Centre.  In the Challenge mode, three cups are available: Bronze, Silver and Gold, each one comprising 4 circuits. Each cup won unlocks the next.  The game can be played using the keyboard or a gamepad. The controls consist in buttons for steering, accelerating, breaking and hand breaking. Three camera angles are available: from behind the car (3rd person view), from the hood and from the car's front (first person views). A "review mirror" camera is also available.  The game has three levels of difficulty and can be played in a two player split-screen mode.
