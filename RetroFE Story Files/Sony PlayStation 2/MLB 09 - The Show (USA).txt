MLB 09: The Show is the 2009 edition in the MLB baseball series. The game keeps the original gameplay intact, but improves over predecessors by revising and adding features, and upgrading the graphics. Road to the Show 3.0 has been updated with an all-new steal and lead-off system and also adds more interaction with the player's coaches. There are also several new features on Franchise 2.0 which include salary arbitration, waiver transactions, September call-ups, and a 40-man roster for the player's franchise. This edition introduces online season leagues, with full drafts and schedules to play ahead in the season.
