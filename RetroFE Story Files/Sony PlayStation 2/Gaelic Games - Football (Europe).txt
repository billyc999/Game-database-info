It's similar to soccer in so far as you got a goalie on each end, but it also has similarities with basketball since you can lift the ball off the ground with your hands, hand pass etc. Players will pass, kick and carry the ball up the other end of the field, and will attempt to score while attempting to dodge opponent players trying to gain possession of the ball.   The goals are a bit different to soccer as well, the player can attempt to kick the ball past the goalie for higher points, but they can also kick the ball over the goalies head where the goalie can't defend for fewer points.
