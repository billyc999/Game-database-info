Colorful Captain Jack Sparrow weaves a tale tall as only he is capable, retelling events fans have come love, and adding new and even more far fetched adventures. Accompanying Captain Jack on his journey of fancy are the young Will Turner and his bride to be Elizabeth Swann.  Gameplay flows much like other third-person action-adventures such as "God of War," "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," or "Demon Stone." Players can fight alone, or team up with a friend to conquer the fast paced, swashbuckling, hack and slash romp through a myriad of interactive and exotic locations. A full player-controlled upgrade system, along with a diverse set of sword fighting and grappling moves, gives players many ways in which to dispatch their foes.  To spice it all up, many challenging puzzles in the form of mini-games can be found throughout the game's 20+ rich and lively levels.
