In this iteration of the Tiger Woods lineage, you can customize your golfer down to the kind of swing to use, strength, putting skill, luck etc, as well as buying accessories and equipment which all affects your game. Create your own courses by spending "Legend Coins" and gain standing amongst the golfing community and impress even Tiger himself.  Putting using the new "Tiger Vision" lets you see how Tiger Woods would play the shot but don't rely on it as even Tiger gets it wrong sometimes. Play against the Hustler, a golfer created by and motion captured by Justin Timberlake.
