In the mystical land of Chandar an evil force has been unleashed as monsters and demons roam the lands, causing destruction and chaos upon the countryside and bring harm to it's people.  The player takes control of a young warrior as he is tasked to stop this evil along with a party of warriors with weapons that range from armor to magic as they vanquish their enemies in an attempt to bring peace and tranquility back to Chandar.  The gameplay borrows from other RPG games as the play transverses various lands with three other characters and encounters monsters which they must destroy either with heavy armored weapons or magical spells.  Doing so will award the player experience points that they can use level up their player and upgrade them while completing tasks and side quests in addition to the main story.  Along the way they can acquire treasure and items to buy other weapons and spells and talk to various NPCs to learn more of they story and learn of side quests.  There is also a drop in co-op mode that allows friends to jump in and play at anytime during the game, taking over for one of the other three characters in the party.
