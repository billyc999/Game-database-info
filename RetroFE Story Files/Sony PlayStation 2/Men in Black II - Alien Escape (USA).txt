The Men in Black take on the baddest alien scum to save the Earth once again. An alien prison ship has crash-landed on earth and its alien cargo has escaped.   Your mission is to track down and apprehend the escapees. You play the role of either Agent J or Agent K each equipped with an array of futuristic weapons to aid them in their mission. Agent J is slightly faster while Agent K brings with him more weapons experience.   Before each mission you get a detailed briefing on your next target. The missions consist of plenty of third-person alien blasting action followed by an encounter with the boss alien.
