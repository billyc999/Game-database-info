Gladius is a turn-based gladiatorial RPG. Players try to build a championship gladiator school by gaining experience through fighting battles in the arenas, and recruiting new members.  From the manual:"The story of Gladius starts just as two schools begin the pursuit of the Championship. It follows the epic saga of two young heroes: Ursula, daughter of the barbarian king from the land of Nordagh; and Valens, the son of Imperia's greatest gladiator. Become one of these characters and embark upon a spectacular and brutal journey to fulfill their destinies to keep the world from heading into another disastrous war."
