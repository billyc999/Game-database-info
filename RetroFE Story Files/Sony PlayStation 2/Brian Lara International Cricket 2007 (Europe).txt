This entry into the Brian Lara/Ricky Ponting Cricket series features all the teams and venues of the 2007 Cricket World Cup, as well as the Champions Trophy one-day event, fast-paced Twenty20 matches, and full-length 5-day Test matches. Player names outside those tournaments are fictional.  There are more bowling styles, including increased reverse swing as the ball ages. Reflex catches from slips, extra run-outs and stumpings are added to the fielding. Batting now includes realistic modeling of shots off the edges of the bat, and a graceful sweep shot. Computer AI plays a more attacking arcade-like game.  Gameplay is offline or online tournaments (on PC and XBox 360, a first for a cricket game) with up to 16 players. Players can create their own dream team of the world's best cricketers, or try one of the new tutorials to build up cricketing knowledge. A roving team of five commentators cover the various matches.
