Logan's Shadow, the second PSP iteration of the long running Syphon Filter series, sees Gabe Logan in the battle of his life as he faces the possibility of his long time friend and ally, Lian Xing, could be a double agent.   This 3rd-person stealth title uses all the tricks in the book, with Logan's task made simpler thanks to a number of gadgets, weapons and techniques available to him. For example, using boxes and walls to duck and cover or humans themselves to create a shield against incoming bullets can save you both health and time in the middle of the action.  New interactive moments, such as unlocking doors or moving heavy items out of the way, require the right timing of button presses to pull off the moves. You will also go underwater to explore the depths of the ocean in order to take down the enemy and solve the mystery that could tear the world apart.  There are five multiplayer modes available, two new to the franchise (Sabotage and Retrieval), and three returning modes (Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Rogue Agent).
