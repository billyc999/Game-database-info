Mega Man is again at the center of a new battle, and along with the return of Zero, the two must venture into the heart of enemy territory and destroy any possible threat by the Red Alert Syndicate.  A combination of 3D platformer and 2D side-scroller, X7 allows you to control two characters during each level, swapping between the chosen two warriors to defeat enemies and solve any puzzles that require their unique abilities.  New to the series is Axl, who's weapon of choice is a pistol, along with the ability to change into any other robot he has defeated in the past for a short space fo time, using their strenghts as an advantage during battle.
