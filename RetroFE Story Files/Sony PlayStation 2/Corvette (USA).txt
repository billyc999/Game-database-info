Celebrate the 50th anniversary of the great American dream machine.  This race game features over 100 Corvette models, from the 1953 original to the fine-tuned 2003.  Simple single and split-screen player modes are available, or start from the beginning and race through history, collecting and upgrading cars along the way.  There are over 15 tracks, with alternate routes that can be unlocked through races.  Models and colors are true to spec, although custom cars can be unlocked as well.
