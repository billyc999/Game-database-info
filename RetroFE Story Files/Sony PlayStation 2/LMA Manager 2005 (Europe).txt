The 2005 edition of the LMA Manager franchise allows players to manage a soccer club from any of the top European leagues, including Holland and Portugal for the first time - or even create a team from scratch in Fantasy mode. You can also interact with the action in new ways - on PS2 you can take an Eyetoy photo to put yourself in the game, on Xbox you can shout instructions to your players via the communicator headset. Uniquely for an Xbox or PS2 soccer game, players can download updated rosters and stats during the season via the internet.
