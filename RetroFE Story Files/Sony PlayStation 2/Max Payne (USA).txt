Max Payne has nothing to lose. His wife and son are gone, killed by Valkyr junkies. His DEA partner Alex is gone, killed by forces unknown, and Max is blamed for Alex's death. The mob is out to get him. The police are out to get him. The only way out is with guns blazing...  Max Payne is a 3rd person action shooter with a twist... Instead of just running around and shoot like Lara Croft, Max has a trick called Bullet-Time (tm). First seen in "The Matrix" movie, Bullet-Time slows the action WAY DOWN so you can shoot the bad guys full of holes before they take three steps... But your amount of bullet time is limited.   Perform rolls and leaps like those you see in action movies and perform bullet-time runs or shot-dodging. Take on all comers armed anywhere from baseball bats to Ingram sub-machine guns, even grenades and Molotov cocktails. Salvage ammo, weapons, and painkillers from this hellhole version of New York to keep your fighting edge. See plot develop in graphic novel-style panels. Will Max Payne see his revenge?
