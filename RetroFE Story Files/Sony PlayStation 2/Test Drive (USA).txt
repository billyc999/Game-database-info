This is the 2002 update to the long-running Test Drive series. The Test Drive games put you in the driver's seat of a fast real-life sports car, and let you drive around at reckless speeds through busy city streets and scenic mountainside highways.  This edition of Test Drive has some improvements over it's predecessor, Test Drive 6. This time around there is a story driven mode, called "The Underground." You take the role of Dennis Black, an independent street racer who improves his standing in the underground street racing world with the help of a mysterious benefactor.  There are 4 tracks: San Francisco, Tokyo, London, and Monaco. These tracks are considerably larger and more open than the previous games.  There are now multiple races and routes through each track.
