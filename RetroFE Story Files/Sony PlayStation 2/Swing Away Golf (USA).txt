Much like Hot Shots Golf and Mario Golf, this golf game involves cartoon characters instead of the real thing.  You can play a 4 player match (basically take turns and finish with the best score), or, if you don't have any pals around at the time, go for story mode, where you choose your warrior, distribute skill points (in areas of power, accuracy, control, etc.) and make a career (in other words, work your way from amateur to pro, winning as many tournaments as possible, etc.)
