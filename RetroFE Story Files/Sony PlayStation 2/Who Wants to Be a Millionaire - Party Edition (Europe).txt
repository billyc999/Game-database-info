WWTBAM:PE is a game based upon the popular United Kingdom quiz show.  Utilising the Sony Buzz controllers, you can play with multiple people at the same time - although the game does support normal gamepads.  The PSP and PC platforms support normal methods of control, it is only the PS2 that benefits from the Buzz controllers.  The game is voiced by Chris Tarrant, the host of the UK show.  The contestants are cartoon styled cliches, in the style of the Buzz game shows, and the format of the show is slightly changed to fit the multiplayer angle.
