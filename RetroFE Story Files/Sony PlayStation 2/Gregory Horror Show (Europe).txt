Escape Gregory's mansion before he steals your soul in this anime-based adventure from Capcom.  You have to run around a spooky hotel collecting all the Lost Souls. However, the guests have stolen the souls and aren't going to give them back willingly. To steal those souls back, you've gotta have cunning. Peek through keyholes and listen to the guests' insane mumblings. Find out their weak point and then use it against them to win the soul. Once you steal a soul off a guest, that guest will chase you. If he/she catches you, you will be put through a "horror show" where the guest tortures you and makes it look like a show!
