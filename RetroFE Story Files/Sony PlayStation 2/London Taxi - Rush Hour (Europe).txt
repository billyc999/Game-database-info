The London Taxi Rush Hour game is based on what black cabs do best: collecting customers and taking them to famous London destinations within the time limit in order to get paid. There will be different routes, obstacles and busy traffic to traverse before picking up one of the many paying customers waiting for a lift. London Taxi Rush Hour features a realistic map of central London for players to race around, complete with famous sights like Trafalgar square, Big Ben and Hyde Park. The Official London Black cab itself is rendered with complete detail, and features environment mapping to bring out the high-polished look of the famous London Black Cabs.
