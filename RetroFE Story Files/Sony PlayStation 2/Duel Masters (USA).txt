Duel Masters: Cobalt brings all the excitement of the collectable trading card game developed by Wizards of the Coast and more to the PlayStation 2, with stunning 3D animé-style visuals, which take their cues from the striking card art and the animated Duel Masters television series already massively popular in Japan, the US and the UK. The player takes the role of one of five characters, each aligned with one of the five powerful Duel Masters civilizations; Fire, Nature, Water, Light and Darkness. As campaigns are played through as each of the different characters, the player learns about each one, eventually unveiling the underlying story before bringing all the characters together at the end for the electrifying climax.
