A conversion of the update to Virtua Fighter 4, Evo features two brand new characters (Goh Hinogami and Brad Burns) and Quest Mode, an all new addition to the series that replaces Kumite mode.  In Quest Mode, you choose your particular fighter and take him or her around the various arcades in Japan where you must earn your chance to enter tournaments. Each battle may also vary in conditions (for example, one match will have you simply fighting to be the winner, while another may ask you to win by only using punches, etc.).  Certain battles will also involve prizes, including clothing and money. Money can be spent on more clothing, wallpapers, character models and much more.
