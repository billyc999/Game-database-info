This sixth installment in the Ace Combat series is a prequel to Ace Combat 5 that tells about the Belkan War eluded to in Unsung War.  The story is told through the eyes of a reporter, 15 years after the altercation, uncovering secrets about the Belkan War of how it led to war, the outcome of the nuclear detonations within their borders and a near disastrous secret that nearly led to the destruction of a nation.  The main game mode is the story mode, in which the player takes control of an Ustio mercenary pilot, call-sign "Demon Lord", taking part of the said war, advancing missions and advancing in the story while doing it. The missions can be anything done airborne, and there'll be escort, assault and defence missions amongst others. Like in the previous games, the game isn't about simulation, but fast paced aerial combat in highly powered aircraft. More like Top Gun, and less like real world.  There are 30 licensed fighter jets to choose from, and as a new gimmick, there is "Ace Style" -meter which determines the story as the player see's fit.  The player can choose to only take out intended targets and be considered a "knight", take out military targets and minimal civilian causalities for a "soldier" ranking or be considered a "mercenary" where the player can take out damaged aircraft and mass destruction of civilian causalities.  As the player plays the game over, the game will adjust to their style, depending on their style the game can send out new and more dangerous squadrons to try and stop the player at any cost.
