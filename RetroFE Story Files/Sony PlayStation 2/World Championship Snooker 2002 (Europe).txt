World Championship Snooker 2002 features a career mode, quick start, single match, tournament, and a special mode that adds new rules to the game. The career mode starts with a training that explains all the basics. Like in the previous game in the series, players can turn on a variety of aiming guides that let them view what way they are aiming and where the balls will bounce.  There are 65 players to beat in the tournaments of career mode. Once players have made your way to the top 30, they will gain access to the more prestigious championship. A number of professional players such a Ronnie O'Sullivan, Mark Williams and Stephen Hendry are included.
