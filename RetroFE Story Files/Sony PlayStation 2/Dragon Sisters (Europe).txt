Dragon Sisters is set 100 years after the great war, and the East Asian state is not doing very well. Constant wars and natural disasters have crippled its economy, so they decide to attack the neighboring Empire in hope of kidnapping some scientists and other skilled individuals. As Empire is a peace-loving country, East Asia defeats their forces in just three days. Luckily there are Kiku and Hanna, two highly trained cyborg soldiers with only one objective: to protect Empire and its citizens.  Dragon Sisters is a 3D brawler fighting game for one or two players in the style of Fighting Force or Streets of Rage. The game's ten stages each end with a boss battle. As the game progresses, the characters gain experience by collecting orbs from the fallen enemies. These orbs lets you upgrade the characters' abilities such as speed, power and health. While fighting different types of attacks can be combined to form large combos.
