Arthur and the Invisibles: The Game is an action-adventure based on the mostly animated film from director Luc Besson who also wrote the children's books it originated from. It follows the film's storyline after the live-action part where a boy must save his grandmother's house from a greedy developer by finding a treasure that his grandfather went missing in searching for it in the magical land of the tiny Minimoy.  When the boy Arthur enters a portal to their land, he shrinks in size and changes his appearance so he becomes like a Minimoy also.  Arthur and his two friends, princess Selenia and her brother Bétamèche, try to save the Minimoys from certain destruction.    There is a tutorial which teaches you movement and combat plus how to move objects and flip switches.  The action begins when a Minimoy ceremony is interrupted by enemy mosquitoes.  You have to alternately play as all the three characters and use the special abilities of each to fight, solve puzzles, fly and drive.  Arthur can smash spiderwebs and climb, while Selenia can cut through foliage, and Betameche can crawl through small spaces and packs an upgradable projectile-based weapon.  Defeating enemies that have special keys is necessary in order to open gates to progress in the game.   In one scene, they ride a mosquito through a cavern while shooting other mosquitoes from the air.  There are also racing sections.  Scenes from the film move the story along from one set piece to another.
