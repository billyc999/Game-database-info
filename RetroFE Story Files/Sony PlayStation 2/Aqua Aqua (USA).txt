Much like the original Wetrix, you must use the many different shaped blocks and build dams around the playing field to trap the water, so it won't flow off. In this version Wetris there is a story mode, where you must complete each level under a certain time limit to advance to the next.   The play field has also had some changes, with each part of the playing field represented by a bingo card in the bottom left of the screen. Every time you clear a part of the area, one of the areas on the bingo card is ticked off.  A new training mode helps you improve your speed and accuracy, and of course there is a two player battle mode, for those who wish to prove they are Wetrix champions.
