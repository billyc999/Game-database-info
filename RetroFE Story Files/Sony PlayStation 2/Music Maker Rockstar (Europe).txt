Up until now, rock guitar games for the PlayStation 2 have only let players rock out to songs written by someone else. Music Maker RockStar changes all that! Now you can rock out in your own style because Music Maker RockStar turns your guitar controller into an instrument you can play freely. You could become a freestyle rock legend as you discover what your guitar controller is capable of!  In a virtual studio atmosphere Music Maker RockStar for PlayStation 2 gives you the opportunity to mix your recordings, add effects, and let your friends try to play your own songs. You can even create a video for the song on two tracks.
