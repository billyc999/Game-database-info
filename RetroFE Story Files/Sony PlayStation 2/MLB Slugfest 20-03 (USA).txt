Midway's first extreme sports title that tackles the great American past-time... baseball.  Take control of all of your favorite Major League Baseball teams and players armed with all of their real stats, attributes, abilities and attitude.  Slugfest features many playable minigames, a season mode, quick play and exhibition play.  So what makes MLB Slugfest extreme?  The game is far from a real baseball simulation.  This is as arcade as it gets.  Flaming fastballs that take out batters ankles (and reducing their stats), out-of-the-park home runs, dropkicking the catcher on your dash to home plate, kidney punching the batter who just ruined your no-hitter and many other brutal tactics bring sportsmanship to an all-new low.  Graphic touches include real player faces and details such as chewing gum and talking to teammates or opponents.  Real stadiums all make their appearances along with several fantasy stadiums that can be unlocked.
