It is a little boy's birthday and all the toys are worried that he will receive a new toy that he will like much more than the other toys. When the boy comes home from school he receives his gift, it is a new doll - Pino.  One of the old toys thinks that the boy no longer likes him and runs away during the night. In the morning the other toys go out to look for him..... will they be re-united?
