SOCOM: U.S. Navy Seals is a military action game, putting you in command of an elite four-person team, that takes you to various locales throughout the world, such as Thailand, Turkmenistan and the Congo.  As the commander of the team, you can give various orders to your squad, instructing them to go to a certain location (marked by military codes Delta, Bravo, Charlie, Foxtrot, etc.), kill people, cover an area, cover you, or set up an ambush.  You can do this via the in-game command system, or with the included voice headset.  Throughout the game, you will have access to over 30 real-life military weapons, such as the SOCOM Pistol, sub-machine guns, machine-guns and sniper rifles.  SOCOM: U.S. Navy Seals is the launch game for the PlayStation 2's online play service.  With an easy to launch system, you can join various players throughout the world to compete against others.  All you need is a PS2 Network Adapter, the game, and a Memory Card with 130-ish blocks of memory.  With the included headset, you can issue commands to your team, or chat with other players.  SOCOM: U.S. Navy Seals includes an on-screen keyboard so that you may chat, or you can use any regular USB-compatible keyboard.  SOCOM: U.S. Navy Seals only supports broadband connections, meaning those using a phone line are out of luck.
