In the newest incarnation of the WWE world, players can compete in six-man contests with the help of a multi-tap. Match types include Hell in the Cell, Slobber Knocker, Table Matches, First Blood, and the brand-new Parking Lot Brawl mode. Visually the game has been given a boost too. Character models (and costumes in particular) have been given a lot more detail than they did before, with a continued emphasis on facial recreation and animation. Old-school fans should also be pleased to know that legends have been reinstated for the roster as well, with the likes of Bret "The Hitman" Hart, "Rowdy" Roddy Piper, Andre The Giant, and "Superfly" Jimmy Snuka being just a few.
