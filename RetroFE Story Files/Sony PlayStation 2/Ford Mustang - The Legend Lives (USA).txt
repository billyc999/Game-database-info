The Ford Mustang is featured in its very own game, as players can choose from 40 different models ranging from the original 1964 Mustang all the way up to the 2005 version. Career mode and "coin-op" Challenges provide a test of driver skill as you unlock new cars and tracks, all while racing against AI drivers and dealing with traffic. New York City is one of seven U.S. cities you will race through, with 22 different layouts overall. Multi-player is supported for 2 players.
