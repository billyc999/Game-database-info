The follow-up to Final Four 2001 features the obligatory roster updates with over 300 real NCAA teams and 31 conferences with authentic fight songs and 70 new player models to give the game a feel of realism.  The standard modes apply such as Exhibition that supports both one-player or two-player and a Dynasty mode that lets the player compete in a full-season in order to secure a place in the 64-team tournament known as "March Madness".  It also features the voice talents of Eddie Doucette and Billy Packer who provide play-by-play commentary.
