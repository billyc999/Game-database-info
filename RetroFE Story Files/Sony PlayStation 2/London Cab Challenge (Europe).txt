London Cab Challenge is a racing/driving game similar to Crazy Taxi but using a British taxi cab.  Each "mission" involves picking up and delivering customers to their destinations as quickly as possible, all while staying in the proper lane and avoiding collisions with traffic. A green arrow appears on-screen as a direction guide, changing to red when the destination spot is within sight. A yellow arrow helps in navigation, warning when a direction can be hazardous. An on-screen speedometer displays how fast the cab is going at all times.  Missions increase in difficulty as the game progresses, and better drivers gain rewards that can be used to upgrade the cab. Scores are kept on a Ranking board.
