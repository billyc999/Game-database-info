High School Musical: Sing It! is a karaoke game based on the High School Musical movies. There are 30 songs in total, which can be sung solo or in duet. While singing, the performance is tracked on the screen. 12 different locations from the films are featured, with avatars performing, while the lyrics as well as the length of the words, represented by bars, are shown. Progressing through the game awards the player with new songs, locations, outfits and characters. Bonus footage has been included as well.  There are 14 characters to choose from, and the game starts with Troy, Gabriella, Ryan, Sharpay, Chad, and Taylor.
