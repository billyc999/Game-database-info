Casper Scare School -- Classroom Capers is based around the movie "Casper Scare School" featuring Casper the Friendly Ghost. Casper visits Scare School with a cast of spooky "children" that includes as Thatch the Vampire, Mantha the Zombie and Ra the Mummy. The game also includes a lot of the original music and speech from the film. The simple but innovative touchscreen gameplay is easy to pick up and is divided into 24 increasingly difficult lessons in Science, History and Gym that Casper must pass in order to get the grades necessary to graduate from Scare School and win the game.
