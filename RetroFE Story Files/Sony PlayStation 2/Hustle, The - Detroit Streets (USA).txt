The Hustle: Detroit Streets takes you through the pool halls and clubs of Detroit, as you prove yourself against the masters of the game. Take on the role of either Jack Stone or Kat Hudson as they make their way to the top of the pool circuit through two different game modes. Players hone their pool skills in their quest for respect and cash, alone or in tough AI competition.  Once you've mastered the AI, you can hook up your network adapter and play against up to 9 friends, or take it online and challenge players around the world.  The game features over 180 different pool sharks, 200 variations on the game of pool, trick shots, 9 unique venues, character customization and a bevy of non-player characters.
