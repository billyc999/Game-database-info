From Capcom's Clover studios, the team behind Viewtiful Joe 2, comes a 3-D cell shaded action adventure in the world of feudal Japan. Okami tells the tale of a wolf-goddess named Amaterasu who must prevent an evil being known as Orochi from taking over the beautiful world of feudal Japan. Okami takes the already well established cell shading technique and turns it into a traditional Hokusai-style Japanese woodblock print visual.  To give the player a sense of being in a painting, Amaterasu is given a paint brush in which the player can cut enemies down with, create bridges or wind, and restore the forest to its natural beauty. With each defeated enemy, color returns and the natural life force slowly regenerates. While playing, players call up a canvas where they can draw with the celestial brush. New abilities and techniques are acquired as you progress.  Okami is filled with large worlds and dungeons to explore on your quest to restore the lush trees and wildlife to their former glory. Many monsters and large epic boss battles come between Amaterasu and her goal. To fulfill her objective there will be many people along the way that will help her if she helps them.
