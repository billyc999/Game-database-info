As its predecessor AFL Live 2003 this game is a simulation of Australian Football  and it's main league, the AFL. Updates include the chance to win player awards throughout the season (including the all important Brownlow Medal for best player of the year). Player Missions will have you attempting to re-create history, or change it, as some of the best and worst moments for each team are there for you to make or break. Plus you can now take your team through the pre-season Wizard Cup competition.  Updates to team rosters, new replay features, photo realistic player faces, and a new commentary team led by Denis Commeti round out the changes.
