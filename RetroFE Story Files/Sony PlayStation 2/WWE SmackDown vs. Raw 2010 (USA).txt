The 2010 edition of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw revamps some of the features of its predecessor, while adding a new Story Designer mode to the series of professional wrestling fighting games. As before, players can control one of the available wrestlers, competing in career matches or in quick single bouts against human or computer-controlled opponents. A custom character can still be created with the Create-A-Superstar tool, now expanded to include 3D apparel and decorations. The Create-A-Finisher feature now has aerial techniques, with jumping trajectory and speed customization.  Some modifications were made to the gameplay, with more grapple moves and a new training mode for beginners. Instead of using the previous two-button system, reversals are now performed based on timing, where the player has to press the correct button when the icon appears. In the PS3/Xbox 360 versions, players can share online their wrestlers, shows and moves. The PS3 version can upload the highlights reel directly to YouTube.
