SingStar '90 is a karaoke game featuring hit songs from the nineties.  The game gives points which are distributed by the purity of singing, as in how well does one manage to stay on tune. It doesn't matter if you change octaves in the middle of the song or what words are you singing in (it doesn't have a word recognition), so your singing is rated by how well you manage to hit the correct note at the correct time.  Here is the tracklist for UK:  1. All Saints - Never Ever 2. Aqua - Barbie Girl 3. B-52's - Love Shack 4. Barenaked Ladies - One Week 5. Billy Ray Cyrus - Achy Breaky Heart 6.
