Players create their own custom character to explore the worlds of the Disney Princesses. Players travel to the castles of Ariel, Jasmine, Cinderella, and Snow White to use their wand to fight the evil Bog creatures which have invaded each of the princess' worlds. Players can defeat Zara, the evil ex-princess, alone or with a friend in a cooperative experience.  At the end of the game, the player has learned the virtues of a princess and becomes one themselves.
