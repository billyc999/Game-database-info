It's Star Wars like you have never seen it before. Each character, from Episode 1, looks more like something from a Japanese animation.  While flying around the many familiar landscapes (Tatooine, the underwater village Otoh Gunga and a driod control ship in orbit over Naboo) your character can use the many weapons and power-ups that litter the tracks, as well as using moves that only they can perform. For example. Jar-Jar uses his tongue to grab onto anyone in front of him, so he can catch up, while Darth Maul throws his double edged lightsaber as a very deadly weapon.  Also keep an eye out for monsters and items that get in the way on the track. Some may be useful, others very annoying.
