Just like the previous Dynasty Warriors games and first Samurai Warriors, Samurai Warriors 2 has its very own Xtreme Legends expansion pack.  New features include six new characters, two new battles ("The Battle of Okehazama" and "The Battle of Shikoku"), the new "Mercenary Mode", and an increased level cap.
