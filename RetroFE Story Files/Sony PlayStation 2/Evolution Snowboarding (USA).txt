The unprecedented experience of Evolution Snowboarding offers players a selection of 10 real riders - including 2002 Winter Olympic silver medallist Danny Kass - and top of the line gear that only the best snowboarders in the world use themselves. Once gamers have chosen their boarder and equipment, nothing can stop them from performing wicked tricks and shredding up the slopes. This action-packed slopes experience offers an easy-to-use control scheme for snowboarders and novice gamers alike, while fusing combative action with high speed riding down the hills. A new "Mission Style" mode adds to the excitement by featuring unique new mysterious and exotic levels - including Chinatown - along with fun objectives to accomplish.
