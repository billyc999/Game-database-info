The game begins as Lucas Kane, the main character, who, under the control of an unknown force, uncontrollably murders a complete stranger in a New York City diner. As the game progresses you will also play Lucas' brother Markus Kane, who became a priest, as well as the police detectives investigating the murder, Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles.  You will play through 44 fast-paced chapters as this paranormal adventure unfolds. Good reflexes and hand-to-eye coordination are necessary to get through the many action sequences.
