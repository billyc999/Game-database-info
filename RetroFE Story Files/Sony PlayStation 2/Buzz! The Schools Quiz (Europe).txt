Buzz! The Schools Quiz is the sixth game in the Buzz! series, and like all other Buzz! titles it must be played using the USB ’Buzz! Buzzers’ controllers, instead of the regular controllers. The game is sold both with and without these Buzz! Buzzers and there are four buzzers per set. This means that using the PS2’s two USB connections, up to eight players can play at once. The game was developed in partnership with the Department for Education and Skills and expert educational consultancy Schoolzone for use in both classrooms and at home. As with all Buzz! Games, it’s set in a game show environment. Players answer questions on different subjects taken from the Key Stage 2 National Curriculum, aimed at children from age’s seven to eleven. There are several game play modes available, allowing players to play on just one subject or from a wide range. Team and single player modes are also available to allow different numbers of players to play at once. A Teacher feature gives the teacher control over how the game is played, allowing them to pause and involve children in the answers being given.
