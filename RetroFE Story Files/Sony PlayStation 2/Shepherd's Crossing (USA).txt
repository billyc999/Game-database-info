Shepherd's Crossing is a farm based simulation game for the Playstation2. Despite its similar theme, it is very different from Harvest moon in gameplay, visuals, and mechanics, as well as being made by a different company. Unlike Harvest Moon's focuses of expanding the farm, marriage, and making money; Shepherd's Crossing focuses on trading, hunting, and management of your farm.
