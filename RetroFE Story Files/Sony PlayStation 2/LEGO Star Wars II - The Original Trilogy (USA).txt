The Legos strike back in the sequel to the original LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game, where players now get to explore the original trilogy of the Star Wars universe.  LEGO Star Wars II is a game where players use LEGO-ized Star Wars characters to reenact all three of the original movies.  All of the sets and props are also made out of LEGO's, and retain their properties such as the ability to be rebuilt and fall apart.  LEGO Star Wars puts an original spin on the series by adding a light-hearted, humorous touch to the movies, and also by using no dialogue.    In this third-person platforming/action game, players take control of the characters and vehicles of Star Wars.  In Story Mode, players reenact the original movies with LEGOs.  Each character has different weapons, like light-sabers for Jedi's, and crossbows for Wookies, as well as new character-specific attacks and maneuvers.  Each character also has different abilities, like Jedi's being able to use the force, R2-D2 being able to unlock doors, or Boba Fett being able to use his jet pack.  It is up to the player to use these abilities to solve puzzles and traverse the levels of the game.  In addition to a single-player game, there is also a 2 player co-op mode that allows two players to play the Story Mode.  In addition, there is also a Free-play mode that allows you to go back and play your beaten levels.  For one, this allows you to go back and play the level with any character in the game that you have unlocked.  However, a newly added feature allows you to create your own mixed up LEGO characters, and also allows you to create your own vehicles out of LEGO's.  Power Brock items and coin stubs collected in Story Mode will also unlock new characters, vehicles, and items for you to play with.
