Happiness and peace reign in Candy Land, when all of a sudden a horde of menacing jelly monsters, rageful bees and menacing cupcakes invades the land. A samurai as valiant as Ninjabread Man can't keep idle at the sight of such a thing: he starts the journey to save the world then, brandishing his cutting sword. Ninjabread's adventure is structured as a platform game; a level is cleared when all the eight rods scattered around are gathered; once levels have been completed a first time, new game modes will be available if they are played further, such as Time Attack and Hidden Pickups, the latter consisting in having to find hidden objects. As regards the jelly monsters, enraged bees and snapping cupcakes, they can be attacked by distance attacks and close ones, employing Ninja Stars, Samurai Kicks, the cutting sword obviously, and more.
