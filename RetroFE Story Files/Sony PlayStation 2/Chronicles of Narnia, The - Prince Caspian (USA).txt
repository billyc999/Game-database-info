The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is based off of the novels and movie of the same name, giving the player the opportunity to play as one of 20 different characters, including the four Pevensie children, Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter, as well as Prince Caspian.  The story takes place 1 Human year or 1,300 Narnian years after the first movie/game, where an evil king called King Miraz has begun to conquer the lands of Narnia and Prince Caspian has summoned the four Pevensie siblings in order to help Narnia and Aslan bring unity back to the lands.  The gameplay is similar to the first, basically hack-n-slash, moving through levels, battling through each levels enemies each with the characters unique battling tactics.  There are six chapters/levels in all, with puzzles scattered through the levels and special "Treasure Chests" as well, that require certain amount of keys to open that will unlock special features such as artwork, pictures among others associated with the film.  There is also a level made exclusive to the game that wasn't in the film or in the novel.  The controls are dependent of the system, while the PS2, PS3 and Xbox 360 uses the d-pad and analog and main buttons, the Wii utilizes the Wii-remote and the PC uses the mouse and keyboard.  There is also two-player co-op gameplay that can have a human player drop-in during a game.
