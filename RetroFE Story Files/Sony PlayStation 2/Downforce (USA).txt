Downforce features arcade-style F1 racing in the future. From what we've seen, aside from the general theme of the game, expect the standard racing modes like Time Trial, Free Race, and a few different championship options. One multiplayer mode is original. In Tag mode you'll have to overtake your opponent and keep your lead for a certain amount of time to win the race. The game features at least seven courses, excellent graphics and realistic crash physics, even though the gameplay itself is much more arcade than your usual F1 simulation.
