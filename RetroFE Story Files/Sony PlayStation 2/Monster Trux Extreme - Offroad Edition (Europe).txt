Monster Trux Extreme: Offroad Edition, as the name implies, is a Monster Truck arcade racing game. There are 3 engine classes to choose from: V6, V8 or V12. There are also 8 different trucks to choose from, and a total of 12 different courses (some of which consist in a previous course mirrored or in a different daytime condition). At first, only one engine class, two trucks and one courses will be available, the others having to be unlocked while playing the game.  Each race is played against 3 computer opponents (or 2 in split-screen mode). During the races, 2 types of power ups can be collected: wrenches and nitros. Wrenches recover the trucks' damage gauge, and come in two types, one that repairs one unity of the damage gauge and one which fully repairs the truck. Nitros can be used to boost the truck speed for a while, each one filling 1/3 of the trucks' nitro gauge. If the player runs over yellow speed stripes on the courses, a little speed boost will be gained. Dollar symbols can also be collected, adding money to the player's profile. Money can be used to unlock new trucks, but it isn't spent: to unlock a new truck, the player only has to have the required amount of money. Money can be lost if the player depletes the whole damage gauge by bumping into obstacles or other vehicles: the truck explodes and respawns at the cost of 10 money units.
