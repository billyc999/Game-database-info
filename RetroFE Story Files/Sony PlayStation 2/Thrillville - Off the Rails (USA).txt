Thrillville: Off the Rails is an amusement park simulator and is the sequel to the original title Thrillville.  Uncle Mortimer returns to aid you with his brand new Woah Coaster pieces which allow the player to build coasters with massive jumps, ring or fire and spinning blades into their coaster.  The main plot line is that Globo-Joy, the rival park owners and main antagonist from the first game, are trying to destroy the good name of Thrillville by putting saboteurs in your park.  The only way to solve the mystery is to help solve your guests' problems by building new rides and coasters or beat challengers to your games.
