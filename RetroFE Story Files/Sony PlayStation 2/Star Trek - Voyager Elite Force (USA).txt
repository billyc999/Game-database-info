On its course to the Alpha Quadrant, the U.S.S. Voyager is attacked by an unknown ship and is transported to a graveyard of ships with a giant space station in the middle. The player is Ensign Munro, second in command of the newly formed Hazard Team, an elite force of Voyager security personnel. It's up to the player and your team to find out why the Voyager was brought here and to find a way to escape. To do so, they will have to complete several missions on different ships and space stations.  Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force is a first-person shooter using the Quake III Engine. The different types of mission range from pure combat  to stealth missions. The enemies include many well-known Star Trek races like the Borg, the Klingons or the Hirogen.  There is also a multiplayer mode called "Holomatch" available.
