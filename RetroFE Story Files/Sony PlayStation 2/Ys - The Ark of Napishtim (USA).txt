This is a direct sequel to  Ys V, the last SNES installment of the popular Japanese action RPG series. After 8 years of waiting, the sequel finally arrived to the PC in Japan. You control once again the main character of the fifth game, the adventurer Adol Christian, on a new journey. After his ship was attacked and he lost his consciousness, Adol wakes up on a sea shore, rescued by Rehda - an elf-like people who live in a small village. Soon he becomes involved in a quest for mysterious treasure hidden somewhere on nearby islands, and has to face an ambitious empire officer who will not tolerate any rivals on his hunt.  "The Ark of Napishtim" is an action RPG in a fully 3D environment. The gameplay is essentially hack-and-slash: you can run around, jump, and hit your enemies with a sword. You have only three types of swords during the game, but they can be upgraded and modified by obtaining special items from defeated monsters, which correspond to certain elements.
