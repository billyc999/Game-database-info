Smash Cars is a simulation of remote controlled cars. You can race 3 different RC cars on 10 different tracks. Each track simulates a real world place i.e. the beach,a military base. Like most other racing games you can race in championship mode to win money to upgrade your car and gain access to new levels. Your radio controlled car reacts much like a real RC would. Many objects your car can interact with like running into people (which will either kick your car or pick it up and throw it) dogs, real cars, soda cans etc. Multiplayer includes up to 6 players online and has support for joysticks and gamepads.
