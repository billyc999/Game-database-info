Equestrian Challenge is an horse riding game based on three-day eventing: Show Jumping, Cross Country, and Dressage.  The player begins as a young rider at the two-star level who is taken under the wing of Lucinda Green, one of the world's most accomplished eventing riders, who trains them and their horse to reach three and four-star competitive events.  These competitive events take place at our officially licensed event locations: Adelaide, Kentucky, Badminton, and Burghley.  The player’s horse must be cared for at home in the paddock to make sure it's fed, watered, groomed, and happy.  The player is also able to develop the horse’s stats (Speed, Stamina, Jumping, Agility, Trust) by winning events and progressing through the game.  At the four star-level, the player must compete against some of the world's top riders, including: Polly Stockton, Mary King, Phillip Dutton, William Fox-Pitt, Andreas Dibowski, Wendy Schaefer, Caroline Powell, Jan Thompson/Byyny, Andrew Scott, Megan Jones, Dirk Schrade, Clayton Fredricks, Karren O’Connor, Nick Gaulett, Darren Chiaccia, and David O’Connor.  During the game the player wins hundreds of unlockables, including: clothes, ribbons and prizes.  Some of these are used to improve your performance in subsequent events, others as awards for winning competitions.  With Lucinda Green's guidance, the ultimate goal is to win all four four-star events at Adelaide, Kentucky, Badminton, and Burghley.
