It's the 21st century (a couple of decades ahead of the present time), and the world is dark cyberpunk place where cyber gear may be as deadly as a real metal gear. The game features two main characters, both ready to handle any given situations, both with special skills and abilities, and what's most important, both girls. Each girl has different methods of dealing with things and different storylines, and you can select with whom to play the game through (each girl has its own disc to boot up). Ice takes her confidence in the firearms and is cool and loud, while Aska is a ninja who prefers stealth over exposure, and uses blunt weapons like swords and daggers.
