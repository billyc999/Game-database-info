The 2006 edition of this winter sports franchise covers the 2005/2006 season. The player can either start as a team manager or as a talented young jumper. There are 41 new settings and over 800 voiced commentary lines to rate the jumper's performances and provide in-game announcements. Jumping can be done in different game modes, including summer challenges and crew-based jumps.  This version includes a tutorial, 3 difficulty levels in the career mode, 3 different leagues to compete in, a revised shop and training system, and a new sponsor system, where a contract provides a monthly income. Next to various tweaks to the physics, graphics and animation, it is also the first part in the series where the player can jump from a first-person perspective.  The game includes a Quiz Games mode to test your knowledge about the sport in 500 questions.
