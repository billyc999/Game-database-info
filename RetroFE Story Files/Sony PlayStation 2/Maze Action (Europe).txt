The ultimate in head-to-head warfare begins as you make your way through battle arenas. Gather keys that are randomly scattered in maze-like environments, which quickly grow as you crush and defeat adversaries. Trap, punch and kick opponents and use an array of weapons to finish them off as you will need to win battles to unlock up to 12 upgrades for each warrior. You will need to charge up your battle tactics to take control of the Maxe-trix.
