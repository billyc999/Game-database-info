Roland Garros French Open 2003 is a tennis game with an official license for Roland Garros and US Open. The game comes with 5 official players and a variety of fictional and quasi-fictional players which resemble actual players in appearance and game style.  The game features game modes: arcade, training, exhibition, career and multi-player. All modes can be played in both singles and doubles. The arcade mode allows you to unlock new courts, players and gear. In the career mode you can start out small and use the cash prizes to further train your character and buy better gear.  You walk around with the arrow keys and you have four different ways to hit the ball: top spin, no spin, back spin and lob. By pressing an arrow key while hitting the ball you'll aim it at a different direction.
