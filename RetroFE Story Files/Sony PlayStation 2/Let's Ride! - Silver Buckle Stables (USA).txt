Congratulations, you're the owner of a new horse farm called Silver Buckle Stables. Choose your horse, pick out your riding outfits and even accessorize your ride with saddles, ribbons, and more. Participate in multiple competitions and practice at the corral to perfect your riding technique to make it to the Equestrian Center where you can show off your skills to earn blue ribbons and additional buckles. Additional features include a horse creation feature (with hundreds of different manes and coats), personalized character customization, open world mini-adventures, and two-player secondary modes.
