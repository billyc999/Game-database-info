Backyard Wrestling 2: There Goes the Neighborhood is the second game in a series of fast paced fighting-wrestling hybrid games.  The game is based on the BYW license, a gruesome series of videos of amateur wrestlers who actually do, at times, wrestle in backyards.  In the game, a tournament has shown up in your town, and the one million dollar prize is turning everyone into a backyard wrestler, and every place into a ring.  Players take their created wrestler through the different federations to have a chance at the money.  There is a versus mode, and unlockable content.
