Similar to a cartoon racer at first glance, the Gadget Racers game world is vibrant, colourful and light-hearted. The game’s racing locales are nothing to shout about visually, and are not to be compared with the likes of Gran Turismo - it’s not that kind of game. Environments are simple, quirky and are obviously designed for a younger audience.  The game itself is massive, covering some 60 circuits - some easy, some notoriously difficult. You’ll be able to choose from a large selection of more than 50 cars, with which you’ll race against nine others on land and water.  In order to make your car suitable for the game’s many hazards, a trip to the body shop is recommended. Here, players can outfit their racers with a variety of car modifications. Aspects such as tyres and steering can be altered and gearboxes, breaks and engines can be tweaked for maximum performance as well. Varying weather conditions can make races a little unpredictable, but it’s the racing skills of the player and decisions in the garage that will make the difference between victory and failure.  Gadget Racers is pure, unadulterated fun. Kids will love it.
