You and your father are the newest residents of Long Life Town, a strange little town with even stranger characters. It is here that you meet the girl of your dreams - Literally. But she wants nothing to do with you.  Your mission is to improve your reputation amongst the many inhabitants of the town by kissing them, so the girl of your dreams will fall in love with you. Kissing people requires you to complete certain tasks, ranging from something as simple as waiting until they feel happy, to more difficult and branching puzzles like helping someone find a job.  Primarily, this game is a puzzle-solving adventure, where you explore the town, trying to figure out what to do next and how to do it. The more people you end up kissing, the higher your Heart Meter goes, which allows you to progress through the story, and attempt more challenging tasks. Approaching angry townspeople or doing something they don't like will take away Hearts, as well as injuring yourself through various means. When all your hearts are gone, you must restart at your last save. Hearts can also be regained by sleeping, eating, and certain other tasks.  You earn money by kissing Underground residents (who only show up at certain times of the day), or by selling items found in the garbage. You can then use this money to buy various items that may help you get further into the game, or train tickets to travel to new areas.
