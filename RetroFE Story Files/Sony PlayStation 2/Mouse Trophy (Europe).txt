In Mouse Trophy is a puzzle game where the player takes the role of a breeder participating at the Rodent Breeder World Championship. There the rodents have to survive mazes in the lowest time possible - of course with the player's help. The rodents act independently, the player can solve the puzzles by changing parts of the labyrinth, e.g. by opening doors. He also can interact with them directly by holding them or using gadgets like electric shocks. These gadgets are limited and have to be found by the rodents in the maze.  The player has to manage up to five rodents at a time. After victories they get experience points and get smarter so the player doesn't have to guide them through every easy obstacle. Overall there are 15 rodents to choose from, e.g. a mouse or a squirrel, and 50 traps and accessories and 30 mazes.
