Gaelic Games: Football 2 is the officially licensed game of the Gaelic Athletic Assocation. It includes all 32 County teams, over 300 Club teams, and 12 major stadiums, including Croke Park, Casement Park, Parnell Park, St Tiernach's Park, Semple Stadium, O'Moore Park, Hyde Park, Fitzgerald Stadium, Pairc U Chaoimh, and Parc Tailteann. The jerseys and stadia are authentic, but as it does not carry the GPA license, the players' names and faces are not.  The game modes are Single Match, Season Mode, Manager Mode, Mission Mode and Training Mode. Single Match is the fastest way to play a game of football. Use the Single Match summary screen to set your favourite team and then randomise the other settings; such as home and way teams, stadium, weather, and rules. Mission mode allows you to take up the challenge and feel the pressure with these historical matches. Each mission has a handicap that a team must overcome; from seemingly impossible score deficits, to slim leads with seconds left on the clock. Manager mode takes you from season to season, with features including a new calendar view of the fixtures, new training to guide your players’ development, season stats for all the players in the league, and leaderboards for all stats categories.  The extensive team editing functions in the game allow you to edit the names of the County team players, and to edit all details of the Club teams; including the team name, uniform style and colours, and the names, appearance, and details of each of the players.  The game also includes support for the Cameo EyeToy and Digimask that allows a player to put his/her head into the game on top of one of the players. Four-player multiplayer is supported using the PS2 multitap.
