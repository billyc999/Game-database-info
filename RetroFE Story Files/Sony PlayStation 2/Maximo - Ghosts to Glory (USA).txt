You control the fate of the gallant Maximo, who returns home to find his kingdom in shambles. Your once-trusted advisor, Achille, has wrought evil on the land. Not only is the countryside filled with hordes of the roaming undead, but the four wise (and beautiful) sorceresses have been imprisoned at the four corners of the kingdom, and to make matters worse, your girlfriend, Princess Sophia, has been forced to marry the scoundrel Achille. Help Maximo rescue the sorceresses, restore good to the kingdom and get your girl back.
