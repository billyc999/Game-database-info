Wild Water Adrenaline is a game based on whitewater kayaking and rafting. Up to four players, in single kayaks or controlling a raft together, can play simultaneously to go down rivers, conquer rapids and drop off cliffs. The player especially needs to pay attention to the steering, which is controlled through the analogue sticks, one for each of the character's arms, to avoid a variety of obstacles. This is done by constantly moving them in a circular motion.  Next to the main game modes, there is also a training to explore the course and get used to the handling. The game is endorsed and has been developed in collaboration with Salomon, a manufacturer of articles for outdoor sports.
