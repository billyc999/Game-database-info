In Wrath Unleashed, powerful creatures called overlords fight for power in a striking and imaginative ethereal world as they struggle to become gods and maintain dominance and magic and control of the world. Overlords and their minion creatures battle for control of magical floating islands represented by a beautiful world map comprised of terrain tiles.  Players can control four potent and deadly overlords and more than 25 wild and fearsome creatures such as fiery dragons, fierce centaurs, enchanted unicorns, massive juggernauts and all manner of demons. Creatures and overlords are influenced by mythology and have unique powrers, design twists and magical abilities. It's a Strategy/Beat 'em up.
