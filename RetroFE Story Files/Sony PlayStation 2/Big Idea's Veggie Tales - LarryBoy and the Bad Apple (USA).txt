LarryBoy and the Bad Apple is based on the popular VeggieTales series of Christian children's videos and specifically on the movie of the same name.  The Bad Apple is taking over Bumblyburg using her power to create a world based around people's temptations. LarryBoy must save the citizens of Bumblyburg, including himself from their temptations to stop her.  LarryBoy has the standard platforming hop move as well as a variety of gadgets to help him accomplish his goals. These include a gliding cape to clear large gaps, a heavy cape to push floor buttons and a radioactive cape to activate electronics. He also has a plunger grapple to let him hit buttons that are out of reach and a squirt gun, both of which are operated from the first-person mode and the standard platformer spin attack.  Enemies come in three types: grunts, throwers and seekers. Grunts are defeated with a spin attack. Throwers throw projectiles, which you must hit back at the them with the spin attack and seekers cannot be defeated directly, but must be lured to an air vent, which sucks them in.  There are five levels, each themed around a particular person's temptation and a final boss fight The boss in each case is the Bad Apple and is defeated a different way each time, essentially requiring you to work out a puzzle.  The levels have various items to collect to unlock things like songs and videos and also multiplayer games like tic tac toe and darts, each with a Larry twist.
