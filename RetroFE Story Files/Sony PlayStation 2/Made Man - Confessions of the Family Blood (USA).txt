The opening sees your character, Joey Verola, talking to someone else about money, lots of money. He (Joey) then goes on to tell his story, whereupon the first level begins: he begins his life of crime in North Carolina, where a delivery goes awry.   The game is played from a third-person perspective, much like Max Payne, with character movement controlled by the W, A, S, and D keys. The mouse is used to aim and shoot, as well as for limited camera movement. You can take cover behind objects by pressing space. This makes Joey press his back against said object (i.e. a wall, a trash bin, etc.) and you can then shoot from behind it. Additionally, a slow mode, dubbed "kill rush" is available for use, but only after you fill up a "kill meter".
