Building upon the gameplay featured in Krome's Championship Surfer, Sunny Garcia Surfing is an updated and improved surfing simulation that takes you to twelve locales where you will ride the ocean's wild waves.  Choose to control one of eight celebrity surfers (Sunny Garcia, Tim Reyes and Rochelle Ballard among others) to surf at world-famous beaches. Video Motion Capturing technology was used to recreate the persona of each surfer and their individual moves. Not all of the courses and surfers are available at the beginning of the game but can be unlocked as you gain experience and points. Also unlockable are various types of surf boards which can effect your performance.  There are many different modes of play including Championship, Rumble, King of the Waves, Time Attack and Free Surf. Each mode has difficulty settings. In certain modes, choose the size of the waves and the weather effects.  Speed and direction is controlled with the analog stick and there are buttons for tricking, paddling, diving and cutbacks. Each surfer has more than 50 tricks that can be performed, the most elaborate ones scoring the highest points.  Licensed music by well-known punk rock bands forms the basis of the soundtrack. In addition to the single-player game, Sunny Garcia Surfing has a multiplayer games offering play against a friend or eight of them using two multi-taps for the Playstation 2.
