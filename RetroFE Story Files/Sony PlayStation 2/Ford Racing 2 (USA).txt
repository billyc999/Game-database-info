If you love Fords and racing, you'll get a chance to live out your fantasies in Ford Racing 2.  Drive Mustangs, Thunderbirds, concept cars, stock cars, exotic sports and race cars - even F-Series pick-up trucks. Choose from 32 models, legendary classics as well as futuristic supercars, like the Ford GT (classified under these categories in the game: Living Legends, Movie Stars, SVT, Concept, Off Road, Custom and Stock Car).  The 16 graphically detailed venues include road race tracks, off-road (over desert and jungle terrain), high speed oval speedways and race circuits. There are different competition types to test your driving skills including: Time Attack, Elimination, Racing Line, Driving Skills and more.  You select the amount of driving control you want. Standard gives you automatic transmission, anti-lock brakes and traction control. Choose Advanced for more precision driving with a manual transmission and more option selections. Learn the controls of the game in "Quick Race" which automatically selects a car for you and puts you on a pre-selected track. Then choose the "Single Player" to race with computer opponents or "Multi Player" for head-to-head competition with a friend. Select from different background music types (rock, funk etc.) to further customize your experience.  Views can be toggled between 1st and 3rd person perspective. On screen in the first person view, the speedometer, tachometer, rear view mirror, are shown as well as a map on left side showing your current location and nearby competitors. Classic car dash panels differ from more modern cars, too. Depending upon your perspective, you'll see your lap times, overall position, rpms and speed.
