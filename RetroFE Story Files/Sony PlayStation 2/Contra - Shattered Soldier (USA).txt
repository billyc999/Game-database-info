The Contra series has been a popular action game for many people.  Now the original creators have come back to bring the series back to the life.  It has the same feel of the other Contra games, but it has never looked anything like this before.  The gameplay is the same fast 2D style, but enriched with 3D environments and effects.  You can play two players simultaneously as in the past games.  Wide array of weapons are available, many of the oldies, some enhanced, some new.  Unlockable endings and levels give it even more replay value.
