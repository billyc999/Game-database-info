Disney Channel Edition, only released in the United States, is another dancing game of the Dance Dance Revolution series from Konami. This time the game aims especially for all those, who are into the Disney Channel series and can’t get enough of idols like Hannah Montana, Cheetah Girls and so on.  The game features music and characters from series like High School Musical, Hannah Montana, The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, Cheetah Girls and more. Included are 40 songs and a new game mode called “Magic Mode”, where the player can compete against characters from the Disney Channel to unlock additional character outfits. In this mode you can fill up a combo meter to apply a handicap to the other player, which makes it then harder to hit the steps right.
