The genuine sequel to the original Armored Core. Thrown into the world of AC mechs, you must complete the objectives set for you by a range of different companies, each with a hefty pay packet attached. If the mission is completed, the money goes towards upgrades and repairs to your mech.   The collection of items to upgrade your mech is fully stocked with weapons, defense systems, rocket packs and guidance systems to increase accuracy and speed. Certain missions require a particular upgrade for the mission to be completed correctly, so spending the cash wisely is important to your career.  Once your mech is ready for battle, you can also take on a friend in arena mode, where one-on-one battles rage on for as long as you wish in huge outdoor areas.
