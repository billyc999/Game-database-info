In Medal of Honor: Frontline, you play as Lt. Jimmy Patterson, a member of a special forces team.  As a soldier during WW2, you must complete various missions and objectives.  You will take part in the D-Day invasion of Normandy, seize the Nijmegen Bridge, infiltrate a weapons facility, sabotage a German U-Boat and more.  You will have access to historically accurate weapons and equipment, such as pistols, rifles, and explosives.  Parts of the game will have you working alongside other soldiers, which adds to the overall experience.  Some missions require you to use stealth, where you must pose as a Nazi and show identification without giving yourself away.
