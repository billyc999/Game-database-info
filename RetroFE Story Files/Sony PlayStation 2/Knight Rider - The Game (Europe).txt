This is a game based on the famous TV series Knight Rider starring David Hasselhoff, which aired from 1982 to 1986 in the US.  In the game, the player takes control over the Knight Industries Two Thousand, better known as KITT, a high-tech, fully computerised car. Together with Michael Knight, you have to fight crime in 10 missions and 15 races.  Many original ideas from the TV series have been included in the game. KITT, Michael, Bonnie and Devon are all in the game, as are the evil Garth and KARR. The player can also use various original functions of the car, like Turbo Boost, Super Pursuit Mode, Ski Mode or the famous Scanner, whose sound everyone should recognise.  The game can only be played in campaign mode, where KITT and Michael have to solve a mysterious case, starting out as a simple bank robbery.
