Knights of the Temple is a dynamic camera third-person hack and slash game set in the medieval times.  You take the role of Paul, a fresh baked Templar knight on his first Crusade, to stop the end of the world.  Fighting your way through the sombre gloom of European monasteries and villages to the colourful bazaars and powerful bastions of the crusader castles under the blazing sun of the Holy Land. Even enter the realms of hell and face your worst nightmares.   The realistic looking motion captured animations and dark gritty textures add to the dirty medieval feeling.  As the game progresses, Paul gains new sword combos and even divine powers enabling him to heal himself, conjure up a divine shield around himself and even shoot off homing fireballs that seek out his enemies.
