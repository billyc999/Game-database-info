Samanosuke is whisked away to present day Paris when he attempts a siege on Nobunaga's fortress. Here he teams up with Jacques, a French commando modeled after actor Jean Reno to take on Nobunaga for the final time. The game also takes place in medieval Japan just like the previous 2 in the series. The game features a new control scheme and a totally 3-D Graphic Engine has opposed to the 2-D pre-rendered graphics of the first 2. The music is a combination of European-style orchestral and Japanese-style instruments. The game itself is fast, visually impressive and has many twists.
