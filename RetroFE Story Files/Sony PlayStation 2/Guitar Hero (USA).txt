Guitar Hero simulates the thrill and the glory of rock 'n' roll. Choose from eight different characters, from classic rockers to metal heads, and build a career as a working rock musician.  The real kick is in the gameplay, which incorporates an included guitar-shaped controller. It allows you to "play along" with 30 awesome rock tunes by pressing fret buttons and working a responsive and durable strum bar. There's even a whammy bar for extreme action. The songs include selections from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Boston, Audioslave and White Zombie.  Four difficulty levels test your skills and six venues will place you before increasingly larger audiences. You love rock music. You're a master at air guitar. Take the next step and walk a career's worth of miles in a rocker's shoes.
