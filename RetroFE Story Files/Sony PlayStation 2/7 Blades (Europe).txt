In the year Kanei 17, the man-made island of Dejima, home of many foreigners, has been brutally attacked by a ninja squad sent by the shogunate. At the same time, a mysterious golden dragon has appeared off the coast of Nagasaki. Hearing of all this, the penniless mercenary Gokurakumaru heads off to Nagasaki with his lover Oyuri and assistant Togizo in hopes of striking it rich. But just what are they getting themselves involved in?  7 Blades is a third-person action-game sequel to the 1990 film Zipang directed by Kaizo Hayashi. The player can choose from two different characters: the womanizing mercenary Gokurakumaru, who uses a variety of swords; and his lover Oyuri, who wields pistols, rifles, and other types of firearms. Each character has their own storyline, which intertwine at various points, and plays very differently by the nature of their weaponry. The game is broken into stages, which each have a specific goal, such as to reach a certain point, defeat all the enemies, or protect another character.
