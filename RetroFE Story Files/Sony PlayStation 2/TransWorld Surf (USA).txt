A surfing game in the vein of Tony Hawk where you perform tricks to rack up points.  With great looking waves and top-notch sound, it can have a somewhat calming effect.  You get to pick from different 13 real-life surfers and 9 different locations such as Pipeline, Hawaii and Teahupoo, Tahiti.  Also includes a "Karma" system where if you act like a jerk (stealing other surfers waves, hitting people, etc.) bad things will happen.  Bad things with dorsal fins.
