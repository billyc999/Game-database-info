Taking a detour from its traditional football games, Electronic Art presents its first 3-D NFL strategy game, NFL Head Coach, focusing more on a coaching perspective than a player's perspective. You experience the day to day job as a NFL coach, recruiting big players, meeting with assistant coaches and running practice drills.  Become a legend in the coaching industry by creating pro bowl caliber players, winning Super Bowls and mentoring coordinators into great coaches themselves in hopes of earning a spot in the Hall of Legends. You can also use the USB Headset to call plays like a real coach, giving you a much more realistic feel to the game as well.  It gives you an idea of how tedious a head coaches job can really be.
