World of Outlaws: Sprint Cars 2002 is a game that focuses on the niche motorsport of sprint car racing. While many people haven't even heard of the sport, most would recognize the distinct design of the speedy vehicles, with their partially exposed frame and trademark roof wing. The idea is simple, and anyone who is somewhat familiar with NASCAR--or any form of automotive racing, for that matter--ought to be able to pick it up with a little practice. The game is for the most part a simulation of real-life racing, with a strong career mode and a number of customization options. There are also elements to it that make it accessible to those who are looking to try something new, but overall, this is a game that is aimed directly at sprint car racing fans. As such, the developmental focus was clearly on the gameplay, seemingly at the expense of the audio and visual aspects of the game.
