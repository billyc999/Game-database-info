Premier Manager 08 is a soccer manager where the player is responsibly for the athletic and financial success of his team. As usual there are a lot of details to take care of, e.g. searching for sponsors, stadium expansion, player transfers, lineup and tactics. But, as usual for English soccer managers, the emphasis is on the athletic aspect.  The player character earns experience depending on his successes and unlocks new abilities with it, e.g. to construct a certain building. The same goes for the staff members. The second innovation is a new bar where the player has quick access to his staff members who keep him up to date - this replaces the usual news systems. The matches itself use an abstract presentation: The soccer field is shown in a top-down, tactical perspective and the player movements are shown with blue and yellow balls. The game features about 400 teams in six leagues.
