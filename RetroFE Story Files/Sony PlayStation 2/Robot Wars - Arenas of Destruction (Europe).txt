A simulation of the TV program 'Robot Wars' , where you can create virtual mechanical robots.  These can be entered into a series of different competitions such as  'battle to destruction', 'capture the flag', 'mad bomber'.  The main arena battles have house robots which can be activated if any combatant robots enter 'corner patrol zones' which are supposed to be off limits.  Again these house robots are modelled on the ones that appear in the TV programs.  Besides the UK arena, this initial launch has many new arenas including: North Sea Oilrig, Rooftops,  Steel Works, Scrapyard, Dockyard and the Abandoned Military Base.  'Real robots' are in the game such as Chaos 2 and Razer and many more.  With these you can recreate your favorite battles against your friend on the same machine.
