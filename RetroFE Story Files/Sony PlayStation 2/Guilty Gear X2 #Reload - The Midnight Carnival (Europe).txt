Reload is an update to Guilty Gear XX, which changes gameplay by balancing out a lot of the moves, also removing some of the moves which gave a character an unfair advantage over another. Additionally, this version adds a new instantly playable character and new missions to play through for the others.  The action is viewed from the side, and the characters include Holy Knights, assassins and bounty hunters. Unlockable extras form a big part of the challenge. The story modes aim to incorporate an evolving storyline with full dialogue. Online play is offered on some systems.
