Ed, Edd and Eddy are three stupid friends obsessed with one thing and one thing only: jawbreakers!  Eddy is the fearless leader, eager to make a quick buck; Ed is the tall, strong and stupid one, while Edd (or Double-Dee) is the smart, polite neat-freak, who communicates with his family through sticky notes.  Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures allows you to play as the trio through a series of levels, called 'scams'.  Each level is a get-rich-quick scheme dreamed up by Eddy, allowing the Eds to get some jawbreakers.  Each level can be accessed via the hub world, the 'Cul-de-sac', where the Eds have their adventures and meet other neighborhood kids.  Players control all three Eds; more specifically, they're always in control of an Ed, and the other two tag along.  You can switch your Ed at any time with the press of a button.  Each Ed has their own abilities: Eddy can hurl stink bombs and form a tower to reach high objects, Ed can dig in sandpits, lift and throw objects, and charge at things to smash them, while Double Dee can use his slingshot, activate machines, and be thrown high into the air by the other two Eds.
