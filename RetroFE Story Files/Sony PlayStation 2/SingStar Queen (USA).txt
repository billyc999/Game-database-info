SingStar Queen is a karaoke game featuring songs from the mythic group Queen, best known for their founder and lead singer, Freddie Mercury.  The game gives points which are distributed by the purity of singing, as in how well does one manage to stay on tune. It doesn't matter if you change octaves in the middle of the song or what words are you singing in (it doesn't have a word recognition), so your singing is rated by how well you manage to hit the correct note at the correct time.  Here is the tracklist (5 songs are exclusive to the PS3):   1. A Kind Of Magic (PS3 exclusive) 2. Another One Bites The Dust 3. Bicycle Race 4. Bohemian Rhapsody 5. Breakthru 6. Crazy Little Thing Called Love 7. Don't Stop Me Now 8. Fat Bottomed Girls 9. Hammer To Fall (PS3 exclusive) 10. I Want It All 11. I Want To Break Free 12. Innuendo 13.
