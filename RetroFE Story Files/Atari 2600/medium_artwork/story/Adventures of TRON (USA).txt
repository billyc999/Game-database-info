Adventures of Tron is based on the motion picture TRON from Walt Disney Productions.

The game environment consists of 4 floors, each with flying "bits" as well as enemy MCP attackers. The objective of the game is to control TRON (you) in a maze of platforms and elevators while trying to intercept the flying bits (intercepting bits on higher floors are awarded higher points).

Dodge enemy MCP attackers by jumping, using elevators and hitching a ride on the Silver Sailor. Capturing all 7 "bits" will take you to the next level, with added speed and difficulty.

You have a total of 4 lives in play. Make each one count!
