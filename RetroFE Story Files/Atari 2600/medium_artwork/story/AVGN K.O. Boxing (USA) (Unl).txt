This is a first-person boxing game where you control the action.
You must face – and defeat – the cast and characters from the
hit Internet show: The Angry Video Game Nerd.
Yes, this is real. Shocking, huh? Well, stop reading this
introduction and read how to play. Otherwise, you will get your
ass handed to you. Honestly.

Boxing Rules:

• Each round is three minutes long.
• You CANNOT be saved by the bell.
• The three-knockdown rule is in effect. If you knock down your opponent three times in a round, you will win by technical knockout. Of course, you can also get TKO'd.
• After three rounds, the judges will decide the match.
• You can have one rematch per opponent.
