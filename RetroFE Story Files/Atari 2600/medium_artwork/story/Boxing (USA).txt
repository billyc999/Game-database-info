Boxing is an action boxing game for one or two players which is played from an overhead point of view. The game lasts for two minutes, and the player who can earn the most points in that time wins. You earn one point for a long jab, two points for a close power punch, and if you can manage knockout it's worth one hundred points. Two difficulty levels are included which can be set individually for each player.
