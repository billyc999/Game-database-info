In Freeway, your job is to help the chicken cross the road! Each time you successfully guide the chicken across ten lanes of freeway traffic, you earn a point. Try to score as many points as you can by the end of the 2 minute 16 second time limit! In the two player game, whoever scores the most points by the end wins. Several game variations are included which can adjust the speed and amount of traffic on the freeway.
