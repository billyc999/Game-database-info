Bowling is, of course, a bowling game which can be played by one or two players. Gameplay is from a side view of the bowling alley; using the joystick, you need to try to bowl the highest score possible by knocking down the pins on the right side of the screen. There are several game variations available; in the easier variation, you can use the joystick to control the direction of the ball on it's way towards the pins. In the harder game, once the ball is released you no longer can control its direction. There are also two difficulty levels which control how difficult it is to get a strike.
