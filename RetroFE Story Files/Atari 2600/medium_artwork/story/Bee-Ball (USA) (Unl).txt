It is well known that bees are industrious and dedicated workers but all work and no play...

Bee-Ball is something like a combination of volleyball and tennis. A ball of honey is served over a net. The opposing player must then swat it back. If the ball touches the ground or goes out of bounds, a point is scored. The first player to ten points, wins. In one player, you play the computer and two player is head-to-head.
