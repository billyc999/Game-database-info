This game is based on an arcade game that was released by Atari.

You play the Road Runner. You must run along the road, avoiding trucks, landmines, falling rocks, etc. and also not get caught by Wile E. Coyote. You must also eat birdseed along the way or you will become faint and Wile E. will catch you.

You can get points for eating birdseed and making Wile E. get hit by trucks, falling rocks, etc.

The Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions are one player only. The Atari 2600 version is one or two player, alternating. The Atari 2600 version also has another difference in that you don't HAVE to eat the birdseed but you can for the points. This may have been due to programming constraints on the Atari 2600.
