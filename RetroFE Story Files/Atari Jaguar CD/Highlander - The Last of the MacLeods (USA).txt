You are Quentin MacLeod, an immortal.  Of course, you are unaware of this until your mother is murdered and the people of your village are captured by the evil immortal Kortan.  Now, you must learn of your destiny, defeat Kortan, and lead your people to freedom.  Highlander is an action-adventure game that is similar to Alone in the Dark.  The game consists of pre-rendered 3D environments that are viewed from many fixed camera angles.  You control Quentin as he fights off guards, explores new areas, and collects items.  Highlander is based on an animated television series, which in turn is based on a series of motion pictures.
