NFL Quarterback Club '95 for the Game Gear is a take of Acclaim's other 16-bit versions, with the same amount of teams, 28 in all, and has preseason, playoffs and a season mode as well, but is missing the simulation mode, QB challenge and the "Build you own" QB mode that the console versions feature.  It also has only 20 different running and passing plays per team.
