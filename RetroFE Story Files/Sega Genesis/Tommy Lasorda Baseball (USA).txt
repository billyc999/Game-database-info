This was the first 16-bit baseball cart on the market. Play alone or with a friend. Choose from any of the 26 major league teams. The game uses all of the real-life city names, but the stats and player names are fictional.

Once on the field, game play follows standard baseball rules. The password feature enables you to take your team all the way through a season to the World Series. The game also tracks all of the other teams in the league simultaneously.

Batters in the game are rated according to batting average, home runs, running speed, and fielding and throwing ability. Pitchers are rated by ERA, curve-throwing ability, stamina, top throwing speed, and the distance a hit pitch will travel. All the ratings make this game a challenge to your managerial ability as well as your gaming skill because you're calling the shots from the dugout.

The option screen enables you to decide how tough your computer opponent will be. You can play a pitcher's duel, a batter's slug fest, or a normal game. Decide whether there'll be fielding errors and determine how the wind will affect the hit balls. This game covers about every detail, right down to umps who shout "safe" or "out."
