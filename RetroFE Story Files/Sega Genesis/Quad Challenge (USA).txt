Rev the engine, pull the throttle, and hit the dirt with Quad Challenge, a conversion of Namco's arcade racer Four Trax. Race one of four different high-powered ATVs on sixteen different off-road tracks. You can play against a friend, or challenge a grueling 16-race championship. Two different difficulty settings and four different control options let you play however you like.
