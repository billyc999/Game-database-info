In the sequel to Test Drive, you can play against the time or the computer. Choose between a Ferrari F-40 and a Porsche 959, and take on your opponent, who is in the other car. There is also traffic to avoid.

Each stage has a different setting, including forests and mountains, with a wide range of hazards to dodge. The game is designed to allow for scenario disks. To finish a stage, you must stop at the gas station by yourself, which allows you to refuel.
