C-So! is a platform game in which you control a man that has to collect items like flowers, apples and cherries, while he is being chased by hostile monsters. The monsters must be crushed or hurled against the ceiling by using a hand spike. Each level also contains elastic beds and doors. The beds make it possible to jump from platform to platform and the doors make it possible to escape the monsters by leaving through one door and showing up at the other. Before you can continue to the next level all items must have been collected and all monsters killed.
