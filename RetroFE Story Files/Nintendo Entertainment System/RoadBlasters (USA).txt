RoadBlasters is a futuristic racing action game. The goal is to reach the finish line in one piece throughout each of 50 levels. Numerous enemies are out on the road to try and stop you, including armored cars, motorcycles, canons on the side of the road, landmines, and more. 

Your vehicle is equipped with a machine gun to help you out, and occasionally a weapons plane will fly in and drop additional power ups that can be collected. Some of these are the U.Z. canon, cruise missiles, and speed boost. Your car has a very limited amount of fuel, however more can be picked up along the way by crossing the halfway point of a level, or by collecting the red and green fuel spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies.  On many levels collecting fuel is critical otherwise you won't be able to reach the finish line.
