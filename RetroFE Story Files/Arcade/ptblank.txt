A challenging light gun game where players can select from a variety of target practice mini games.
Many games require skill and accuracy such as shooting cardboard cutouts of criminals, a one-shot chance at hitting a leaf, aiming for a specific toy from a shelf, and shooting at objects that move across the screen or rush towards the player.
Your 'judgement' is based on your shooting accuracy in some games, and others require you to hit a certain number of targets within the given time.,
