A platform hack 'n' slash game from Taito in which a single player guides a barbarian hero through a number of fantasy-themed levels fighting through swathes of mythological fantasy creatures, including orcs, skeletal warriors and multi-headed hydra.
More powerful weapons can be picked up, as well as bonus items that can increase the barbarian hero's health and give increased protection against enemy attack. Players should be wary that some collectable items are cursed and will have a detrimental effect on the hero's health and performance. Unlimited continues are available throughout the game.,
