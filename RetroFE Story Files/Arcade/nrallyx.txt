In New Rally-X, the player drives a car around a maze picking up all of the yellow flags, of which there are 10, before the car's fuel runs out. The game-play has a similar feel to another Namco legend, "Pac-Man"; although in New Rally X's mazes are much larger and, with each maze having only 10 flags to collect, is more sparsely populated than Namco's pill-eating legend.
In-game opponents consist of red enemy cars that try to ram into and destroy the player's car, a problem compounded by the fact that enemy cars are faster than the player's. A smoke screen can be activated which trails behind the player's car and causes any pursuing enemies to crash. Each maze also has rock formations which, if crashed into, will result in the loss of a player car. A radar display to the right hand side of the playing area shows the positions of both the flags and the enemy vehicles.
New Rally X is an update of the 1980 release, "Rally-X". The sequel has slightly different graphics to the original game, and has more forgiving gameplay.
