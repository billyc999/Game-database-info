A strange and hugely abstract beat-em-up for one or two players, in which circus clowns take to the streets to beat up other circus performers; as well as lawyers, maintenance workers, and other assorted professionals.
In addition to the standard beat-em-up kick and punch moves, the clowns can use their 'clown equipment' against their enemies; using items such as spring-loaded boxing gloves, bottles of soda water and, of course, cream pies.
