SUBROC-3D is an overwhelming 3-dimensional game, with a dual scene system for battles in the ocean or in space. The graphics and sound effects are very exciting!
You command a sophisticated craft and by using the elevation controls you can move it up or down so it can be operated under water or in space.
The periscope-type viewer can be moved from side to side, enabling you to attack more enemies.
Preen the fire button to shoot down the enemy.
The dynamic stereo sound system creates an amazingly realistic surround effect.
Many strangely-shaped crafts, missiles and UFOs suddenly zoom in to attack you; once they are in your sights they can attack you, so shoot first and survive!
The 3-dimensional effect of fast-moving crafts and missiles, combined with the terrifying  explosions seemingly right up close to you are truly bewildering.
To destroy the BARRIER guarding the enemy COMMAND SHIP, you must hit it in the very center.
After blowing up the COMMAND SHIP, you proceed to another round.
The bonus points remaining will be added to your score.
When you reach HIGH SCORE you will get another ship.
In each successive round the score increases by 100 points over the previous round.
Your score and the round are displayed at the top of the screen. Your score and the previous best three scores are displayed over the periscope.
Play ends with the loss of your last ship.
