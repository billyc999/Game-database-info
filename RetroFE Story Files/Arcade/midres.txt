One or two players take on the role of two commando brothers whose entire family has been kidnapped and must be rescued. The game's eight large eight-way scrolling levels are made up of platforms, ledges and ladders; each populated both with enemy soldiers and with intricate, imaginatively designed enemy machinery.
In a gameplay mechanic first introduced in SNK's 'Ikari Warriors', players can rotate their guns through 360 degrees, allowing them to target and fire in all directions.
Some enemies, when killed, will drop a red key; collecting these keys allows players to upgrade their weapons at the shop that awaits at the end of each level. A maximum of six keys can be carried at any one time.,
