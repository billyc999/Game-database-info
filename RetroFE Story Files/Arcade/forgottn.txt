Two jet-pack wearing marines must battle a powerful enemy force that has seized and inhabited their home planet - now known as 'Dust World' - and restore the planet to its former name of 'Earth'. Forgotten Worlds is the third and final game in Capcom's 'Jet-Pack Hero' trilogy (with the first two games being 1985's "Section Z" and 1986's "Side Arms - Hyper Dyne") and, as with the first two games, is a one or two player sideways scrolling shoot-em-up.
Forgotten Worlds' gameplay features multi-directional shooting, with the Marines being able to rotate through 360 degrees, allowing players to fire in any direction. When killed, enemies drop 'Zenny Coins' which can be used to upgrade weapons and player health at the shops that appear at the halfway point of each level. Forgotten Worlds features superb graphics and ingenious enemy design, and was converted to many different home formats.
