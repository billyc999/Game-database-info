For this sequel to the 1982 classic "Dig Dug", Namco changed the game's perspective from a sideways viewpoint, to an overhead one. Action now takes place on a series of small islands.
The gameplay itself retains much from its predecessor, with players still armed with a pump that allows them to inflate and burst the enemies. For this sequel, however, Namco also introduced ground-based charges. Players can activate the charges in order to join them up with other charges, represented on screen by the appearance of trenches. Once a line of charges is linked to two of the island's edges, the charges will detonate and destroy a piece of the island, killing any enemies that happen to be standing on the piece when it's destroyed. Players must be careful not to be standing on a piece that is destroyed, or they themselves will be killed.,
