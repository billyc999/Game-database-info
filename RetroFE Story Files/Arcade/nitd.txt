A peaceful (yet creepy looking!) gravekeeper embarks on a night-shift battle against zombies & other night dwellers in order to put an end to the grave robbing mystery before the local villagers panic! Features very nice graphics with cool backgrounds, great soundtrack & pretty fun gameplay in the same style as "Snow Bros. - Nick & Tom", "Tumble Pop" & "Zupapa!". The deceased must rest in peace, so be sure to remind them of this fact! :)
