This is an "Arkanoid"-type game with a few twists. Instead of controlling a paddle, you control the ball itself by altering its momentum using the joystick. Various blocks (squares, triangles, and special blocks containing powerups) advance down from the top of the sceen. The player dies when the ball goes down through a hole in the bottom of the screen, or if the blocks reach the bottom of the screen. When you die, you start over at the beginning of the level. Although the game has a ball and paddle look and feel, puzzle elements come into play later in the game.
