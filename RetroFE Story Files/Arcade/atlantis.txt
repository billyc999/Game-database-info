Your mission : Finish the six tables at all costs by eliminating a maximum of opponents. To Do this you possess a multi-directional laser (ultra-rapid firing) and terrifying torpedo-bombs. Through all 6 tables, build up your bonus by blowing-up the fuel tanks.
Table 1 : Avoid and destroy the floating mines.
Table 2 : The deadly explosing sharks appear as well as the destroyers (avoid their bombs!). Obliterate them with your laser.
Table 3 : You penetrate into an abyssal cavern where redoutable octopu's lie in wait. The destroyers can only drop their bombs through the thin sides of the cavern.
Table 4 : A complex of towers replaces the lower part of the cavern. As well as the destroyers and octopus, the mines reappear in large numbers.
Table 5 : Accelerated version of Table 4.
Table 6 : You return to Table 1 in an accelerated version but you must face up to all your opponents.
