Solar Fox is a space shooter and a Pac-Man-type game all in one. The playing field is square and only has walls on the outside. Each wall has a moving cannon mounted that will fire odd shaped torpedoes at your ship. Scattered around the inside will be a bunch of pellets in various simple patterns. To complete each level you have to drive over, or shoot all of the pellets. If done quickly enough the game will skip a level (going from 1 to 3, etc).
