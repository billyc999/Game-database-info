A superb sideways scrolling shoot-em-up for 1 to 4 players set in America's Wild West. 4 sharpshooter bounty hunters (Steve, Billy, Bob and Cormano) set out to claim the bounties given for killing the most wanted outlaws in the West. The ultimate aim is to survive long enough to reach the final showdown against Sir Richard de la Rose.
Sunset Riders is an incredibly playable game featuring colourful and well-drawn graphics, with a number of humorous visual jokes keeping players entertained. The side-scrolling action takes place both on foot and on horseback, with the action sometimes broken up with a wild west pursuit; such as having to run along the backs of a herd of fleeing Buffalo.
Each level ends with players entering a one-on-one battle against one of the wanted men they have been pursuing. Weapon power-ups can be found and collected to help players in their quest.
