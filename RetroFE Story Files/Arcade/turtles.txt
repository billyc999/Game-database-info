Turtles is your standard maze game (one of dozens released in the wake of "Pac-Man"), with a few twists. The game begins by showing your turtle entering a building (a very early 'cut scene'), you are then presented with the first maze. Each maze has several boxes (with question marks on them), scattered around. You most open these boxes one at a time by walking on to them. Each box contains either an enemy bug (who will pursue you), or a 'KidTurtle'. The 'KidTurtles' are what you are looking for here. When you find one it will climb onto your back, and take it back to the turtle house which will be located in one of the corners. After you rescue a few turtles the game becomes more difficult because of the amount of baddies that you will have released, but luckily a star will appear in the center of the screen to help you out. Grab this star to gain land mines. You can drop these in the path of a baddie, and cause him to freeze temporarily (you can safely walk over frozen baddies). A new game screen starts after you rescue all the 'KidTurtles'. After 8 levels you get to watch a small ending sequence, and then the game starts over with increased difficulty.
