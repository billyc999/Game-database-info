After King Bomber was defeated in the last game, he tried to reform himself but being a bad guy seems to be more fun, so he now has taken over the United Nations' building as the first step to take over the world. Only Bomber Man and company can save us from this world threat! Features cute graphics & sound, as well as the same addicting control that made the first a classic. A party game if there ever was one, grab 4 friends and have a blast!!! :)
