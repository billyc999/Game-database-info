A direct sequel to the superb 1989 original the player once again takes on the role of Strider Hiryu; a ninja who wields a deadly plasma-ejecting cypher called the 'Falchion'. Players start the game by selecting one of three difficult missions, with a fourth becoming available once the initial three are completed. Completing the fourth mission will unlock the final 'boss' mission, in which the player must battle a number of bosses which includes the rogue 'Strider Hien' from the first Strider game. Once all missions are completed, the character of Strider Hien - who wields two ranged cyphers - is unlocked.
To add variety to the tight gameplay, Capcom included special unlockable and powerful skills to aid players on their missions. These included the Savage Slash ('Midare-Giri' in Japanese), Hassou Jump, Boost (unlimited if missions defeated by Hien) and rapid slash.
Strider 2 features improved graphics - now rendered in pseudo 3-D - but with hack-and-slash gameplay largely unaltered from the first game. One difference to the original is a greater emphasis placed on boss encounters.,
