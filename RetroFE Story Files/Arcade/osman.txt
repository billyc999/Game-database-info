A platform shoot-em-up that doesn't just 'borrow heavily' from Capcom's 1989 classic, "Strider", it blatently steals from it. The player controls a 'Cannon Dancer' called Kirrin : a highly acrobatic hero who is also a skilled martial arts fighter. Kirrin must jump and fight his way over a number of colourful, inticately-rendered levels in his bid to defeat the enemy forces. In addition to the many power-ups that are availble to strengthen Kirrin's attacks (with each power-up indicated by a colour change to Kirrin's costume), the player is armed with three 'Magic' attacks per life, which work in a similar fashion to those of Sega's "Shinobi".
The Strider-esque gameplay is, if anything, an improvement over the illustrious game upon which it is based. As well as the mandatory improved graphics, understandable given the six years that seperates the two games, OSman's level design is hugely inventive and offers more variety than Strider's stages.
