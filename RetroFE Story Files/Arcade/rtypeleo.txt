The third and final arcade release of this classic series (which would foster three further console-only sequels see 'Series' for details) sees the Bydo Empire waging a full scale assault against other planets.
R-Type Leo possesses many of the elements that made the first two games in the series such classics, but the feel and gameplay is very different. Both the beam laser and the pod make a return, but play a different role in this game. The pod in particular now acts more like a mini 'smart bomb', in that it only detaches from the player's ship for a few seconds, and automatically homes in on enemies. The level design is also far more open than that of its predecessors, and far more forgiving.
R-Type Leo is a game that firmly divides opinions of fans of the series. Some considered it to be a blasphemy to the R-Type name, arguing that in making a game far more 'traditional', both in feel and level design, R-type Leo actually represented a step backwards from what the innovative original achieved. Less patient players undoubtedly prefer Leo's open levels and forgiving gameplay. Something that all can agree on, however, is how stunningly beautiful the game is. The detail and use of colour on both the backgrounds and enemy ships is incredible and is one of the finest examples of two-dimensional artwork the arcade has ever seen.,
