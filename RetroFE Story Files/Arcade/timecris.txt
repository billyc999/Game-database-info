A superb, on-the-rails lightgun game in which the player takes on the role of a lone mercenary who must rescue the President's daughter, Rachel, from the clutches of the evil 'Sherudo' and his terrorist gang. The game takes the player into and around Sherudo's clifftop, castle hideout.
As the game's title suggests, time is one of the player's biggest enemies, as each area must be cleared within a strict time limit. Extra time is occasionally awarded, however, when some of the more powerful enemy soldiers are killed.
The game offers the player two different game modes :
STORY MODE : the player must defeat all of the enemies on the level to proceed to the next level.
TIME ATTACK : the player selects one of four stages and must defeat all enemies in the time allowed. The player is given unlimited lives in this mode, but is constantly fighting against a very tight time limit.
