Set in Antipodean country of the game's title, The New Zealand Story is an incredibly cute and challenging platform game featuring Tikithe Kiwi bird, possibly the most lovable arcade character ever created. Tiki's fellow Kiwi birds have been kidnapped by an evil walrus and Tiki is charged with rescuing his friends.
The New Zealand Story is a superb, constantly inventive and very demanding platform game that features a wide variety of intelligent and distinctive enemies; such as heavily armed ducks, angry walruses, and whales made of ice that spit giant snowflakes.
During his quest, Tiki can commandeer a variety of different weapons and vehicles - the latter of which include balloons and a hovercraft. The level design is superb, with exploration often rewarded with either bonus items, alternate routes to the end of the level, or secret level warps that transport the player to a later level (see 'TIPS AND TRICKS' for more details).
