A far away land filled with monsters and under the hand of an evil king is on the edge of destruction. Only a small group of brave heroes (a dragon warrior, a fairy & a prince) dare to step forth to look for lhe legendary sword of the Golden Hawk hidden in the flying citadel known as Gaiapolis in order to topple the evil king and bring peace to this troubled land. Features some very nice 2-D graphics, awesome character & enemy artwork designs, a superb soundtrack and addicting hack & slash action with some RPG characteristics (characters & weapons level up, plenty of magic spells & summons). If you enjoyed Taito's Cadash, this game is for you!
