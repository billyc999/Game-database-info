A game of strategy and skill! The object of Crazy Balloon is to guide a delicate swaying balloon through a maze of pin wheel obstacles.
You have 4 control buttons and you have the ability to move your balloon in any direction. Don't take too long, because if you are too slow, a bogey man erupts on the screen and forces you to move. Just when you think you have the maze all figured out, pin wheels attack your balloon forcing you to take evasive action.
