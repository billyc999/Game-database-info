Jessica, the daughter of the city Mayor Mike Haggar has been kidnapped by the evil 'Mad Gear' gang. Set in the fictional Metro City, Haggar rounds up two of his closest friends, Guy and Cody, and sets out to battle Mad Gear's gang members and ultimately rescue his daughter.
1 or 2 players choose to play as either Guy, Cody or Haggar in this superb, sideways scrolling beat-em-up. As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is powerful enough to fell several enemies at once, but with the trade-off that each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's energy is lost. Energy levels can be replenished by finding the food that lies hidden in certain crates and barrels. Some of the Mad Gear gang members will drop a weapon when they are felled. These weapons can then be picked up and used by the players.
After the benchmark-setting "Double Dragon", released by Technos in 1987, Final Fight would become the standard-bearer of the scrolling beat-em-up genre. Featuring a large variety of distinctive, well animated characters moving through colorful and detailed backgrounds, and with a control system that is as intuitive as it is complex, Final Fight is still considered to be the finest example of its kind.
