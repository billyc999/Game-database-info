Two young children, Pyros and Erika, have unexpectedly strayed into a wonderland called 'Wardner's Forest'. Upon entering the magical forest, the young girl is changed into a crystal ball by evil warlock and ruler of the forest, 'Wardner'. She is taken to a secret place deep inside the woods. The brave young Pyros, armed only with a magical flame as a weapon, sets out to rescue his female companion from the clutches of the evil Wardner and bring her safely home.
At the end of every level, Pyros enters a shop. The player can use any gold that has been collected on route to buy useful items; such as extra health, time and more powerful weapons. Wardner is an accomplished and playable platform game with smooth, colourful graphics and finely honed gameplay.
