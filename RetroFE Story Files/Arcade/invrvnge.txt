Invader's Revenge is a simple two-dimensional shooter. You control your fighter to defend your supply against an endless stream of alien invaders. Once you clear out one wave of 6 invaders, another wave comes in to take your fuel. After seven waves of alien invaders, you will then be given the chance to dock with your base to refuel. Of course, you have to navigate the hazards to get to your base. Your objective is simple, prevent the aliens from taking or destroying your fuel supply.
