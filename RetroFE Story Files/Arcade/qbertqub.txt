The object of Q*bert's Qubes is to jump around diamond formation of 25 cubes and rotate them so that one or more rows of cubes match the shown target cube (a tic-tac-toe) while avoiding the meltniks the rat and the purple guys. Jumping on anything green is safe, catching the turtle slows down enemies for a short time and catching the freeze ball freezes enemies for a short time.
Each level has four rounds and a bonus round and there are 11 levels...
Level 1 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, cubes only have 2 colors
Level 2 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, cubes only have 3 colors
