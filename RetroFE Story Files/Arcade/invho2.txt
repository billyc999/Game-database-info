Head On 2 is a 2-D maze racing game. You control your car through the maze to pick up the dots while at the same time avoiding the car, or cars, that are constantly trying to ram you. Successfully get through one maze and many more await you. This is good practice for freeway driving in the big city.
Invinco is a game inspired by "Space Invaders" with some innovation on the aliens : One row blinks in and out of view, another row's aliens roll so as to make themselves harder or easier to hit, and a 3rd row of aliens each take (at least) 3 hits to kill. A 4th row has aliens that turn into bombs, blowing up everything around them to make your job somewhat easier.
