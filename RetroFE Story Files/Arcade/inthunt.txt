In the Hunt is a sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two-players. Each player takes control of a submarine and must shoot their way through the game's six levels as they are attacked from both beneath the water in which the submarine moves (by enemy subs, gun emplacements, mines etc.), as well from above the water-line, by boats, jet fighters and helicopters. Numerous power-ups can be collected to boost the sub's meagre fire-power.
The game was created by the same team behind the legendary "R-Type" series, with In The Hunt's superbly-rendered graphics being very similar in style to Irem's "R-Type Leo", released a year earlier. In The Hunt would prove to be Irem's last 'traditional' arcade shoot'em up, although two further R-Type sequels were released for home consoles (see R-Type "Series" section for further info).
