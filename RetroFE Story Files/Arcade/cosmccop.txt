A futuristic shoot-em-up from the creators of "R-Type" in which the player takes on the role of a futuristic policeman who must destroy criminal controlled ships.
As with most Irem shoot-em-ups, Cosmo Cop's weapons system is superb. As well as being equipped with the standard front-firing gun and ground targeting missiles (both of which can be upgraded with the retrieval of power-ups), the player's ship is armed with a homing laser that, when activated, emits a constant laser stream towards whatever enemies and bonus capsules are on screen. The laser has an 'Overheat' meter that depletes while the laser is in use. Once the meter is emptied the laser will stop working. The meter gradually refills allowing the player to continue using the laser.
