Hatris is a Tetris-type game where instead of blocks descending, there are hats; top hats, wizard hats, beanines and the like. The game is played by making vertical stacks of hats. When a stack of five hats of the same type and color is created, it disappears. The challenge of the game is that different styles of hats will stack differently. The game ends when one of your stacks of hats reaches the top of the screen. Occasionally, a red or a blue flame will appear. One burns just the top type of hat on a stack. The other will burn a stack to the ground.
