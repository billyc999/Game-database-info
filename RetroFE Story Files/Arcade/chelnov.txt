A horizontally scrolling platform shoot-em-up in which the player controls Chelnov, a former coal miner caught up in a Chernobyl-like nuclear accident. Now possessing superior physical strength and agility, Chelnov is determined to escape the Eastern Bloc country he called home and run and jump across the world to finish in the US.
What distinguishes this game from others of its genre is its use of forced scrolling. The screen moves continuously from left to right and players must negotiate the game's many obstacles and enemies without the benefit of dictating their speed of progress. Enemies attack from left, right, above and below and Chelnov can switch the direction he's facing to attack enemies that are behind him. Some enemies carry different types of weapons and power-ups and when they are shot the power-ups drop to the ground and can be picked up.
