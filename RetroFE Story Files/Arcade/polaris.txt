A 1-player, single screen shoot-em-up, baring many similarities to Taito's most famous shoot-em-up, "Space Invaders", in which a player takes on the role of Commander of a Polaris class nuclear submarine. War has been declared and the Polaris' mission is to defend the country from enemy attack.
In battle, players must defend against wave after wave of enemy planes (fighter jets and missile-dropping bi-planes) as well as enemy subs and destroyers. Players must also be careful to avoid the many mines and depth charges that litter the ocean.
