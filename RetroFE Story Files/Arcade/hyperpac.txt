This is an updated version of Namco's seminal "Pac-Man" featuring forced-perspective 3-D graphics that allow the players to jump over the enemy ghosts; in a similar fashion to Namco's "Pac-Mania", released in 1987. There are secret items and food to be found on each level that increases the player's power and score. The power-ups themselves consist of a shield, helmet lasers, speed and jump shoes. Players will face a boss encounter every ten stages and the game ends after the 30th stage.,
