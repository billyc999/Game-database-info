The ghosts are the same if their edible forms are changed. The maze is familiar, if a bit off in color. The prizes in the center are a bit different. Be careful, however : Pac-Man may eat a power pill and find that Blinky, who is right in front of the energizer for him to immediately eat, is still red, and now Pac-Man is dead. Also, you might want to try eating the ghostsafter eating the center prize. They'll return to their normal forms shortly after turning visible.,
