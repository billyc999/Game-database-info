Dr. Clayborn and his henchmen have taken control of the city and Commissioner Gordon (no, Batman is not in the game) made one last plea for help and called three of New York's Finest undercover cops : Bubba, an ex-professional football player; Flame, a former Miss America; and Claude, a retired philosophy teacher. They must fight every lackey and vanquish Dr. Clayborn in order to restore law and order to the city. Very fun beat-em-up where almost anything can be used as a weapon; fish, rocks, i-beams, cars, etc.
