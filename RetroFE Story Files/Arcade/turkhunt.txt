Turkey Hunting USA allows the players to hunt in 5 different states : Florida, New Mexico, Montana, Pennsylvania and Kansas. Each of the states has a different weather condition and level of difficulty. If a player achieves a top-ten raking in one of the states, he or she will become a grand slam master. There are also four different weapons to choose from: rifle, shotgun, power bow and muzzleloader. Bonus stages allow players to test their hunting skills. Obtaining a perfect score during one of these stages awards the player with different turkey calls or decoys.
