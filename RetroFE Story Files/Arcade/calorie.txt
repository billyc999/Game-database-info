A traditional platforms and ladders game in which the player controls an abstract, mole-like creature that must make its way around a number of underground tunnels, avoiding enemies and collecting the items placed around the screen; before quickly making its way to the exit. The player is armed with a limited number of bombs that can be used to destroy or disable enemies.
