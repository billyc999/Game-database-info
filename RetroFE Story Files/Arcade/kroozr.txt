Guide Kapt. Krooz'r into the mothership while either shooting, deflecting (with his shield) or avoiding various attacking enemies. Kapt. Krooz'r can only enter the mothership when it extends down a tractor beam. A bonus round, where Kapt Krooz'r must pick up spaceship parts from the Kozmik Junkyard, occurs every fifth round.
