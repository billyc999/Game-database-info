Time to take up your paint brush and paint the town Red (or Green or Orange, or whatever color you happen to have on hand)! A pair of fish are out to stop you but you can roll over them at the overpass. There's other items that just try to mess up your paint job; you can run over these folks easily (if you catch them).
