A platform game in which Flicky must collect her lost chicks and lead them home, represented as a door marked 'Flicky'. Players must watch out for the cats which emerge from cat-flaps and proceed to roam the levels. If flicky has any direct contact with a cat, the player will lose a life; any chicks that are touched by a cat will be seperated from Flicky and must again be retrieved. The platforms of each level are littered with objects - such as plantpots, hammers and trumpets - that can be picked up and thrown at the cats to knock them out.
