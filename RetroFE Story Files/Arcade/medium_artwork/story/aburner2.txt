Another 3-D Sega game rendered with their superb sprite-scaling technology; this time putting the player into the seat of a powerful jet fighter.
23 colourful, fast-moving stages await the player, as he or she takes on the hordes of enemy planes intent on the player's destruction.
At the end of every 2nd stage, the player's jet fighter is re-fueled and re-armed, either by the appearance of a large support plane, or by landing on a military airstrip.
After Burner's straightforward shoot'em up gameplay is unremarkable and repetitive, but fun - largely down to the game's incredible visuals.
