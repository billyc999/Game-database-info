The plot begins when narcotics agents Paul and Bobby are committed to putting an end to the drug syndicate known as "MID". MID's secret hideout is located on Riot Island, an island full of uninhabited ruins with people moved inside of it while turning it into a slum. Buildings include apartments, hospitals, factories and even a casino. During their heavy research on MID, they unexpectedly received a phone call from MID. When Paul heard the voice of his girlfriend Catherine crying for help on the phone while being hung up without explaining, he assumed she's been abducted, making him and Bobby head toward Riot Island and save her.
