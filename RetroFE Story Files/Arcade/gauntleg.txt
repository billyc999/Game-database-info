Gauntlet Legends is a fantasy themed action game a sequel to 1985's popular "Gauntlet" and 1986's "Gauntlet II". Its unusual features for an arcade game included passwords and characters that could be saved, enabling players to play over the course of a long period of time. It was a role-playing game, though with very limited role-playing.
The simplicity of the original Gauntlet series is still here : You have to find your way out of a maze using keys, secret passages, and switches. In your way are hordes and hordes of enemies, endlessly reproducing themselves from generators painfully spread around the gigantic, menacing levels.,
