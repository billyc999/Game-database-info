Created as a parody of Konami's own superb and challenging "Gradius" series of shoot-em-ups Parodius Da! acquired its own identity and would spawn sequels of its own.

Parodius' eccentricity and unique humour is further demonstrated soon after the game begins; as players face such enemies as a giant belly-dancing woman and a half-cat/half-boat creature.,
