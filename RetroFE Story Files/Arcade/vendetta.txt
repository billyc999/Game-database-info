Evil is lurking in Dead End City. In a turf war the Dead End Gang has kidnapped Kute Kate from the rivals, the Cobras. The Cobras set out to save her and stop the expansion of the Dead End Gang in Vendetta.
The Dead End Gang is looking to expand their territory, so the Cobras must infiltrate every area around the city. First, they must gain entrance to Dead End City. Relying on their fighting skills, the Cobras face a multitude of enemies. However, each member is up for any challenge from the Dead End Gang. The Cobras are a powerful team consisting of : Blood, an ex-prize fighter; Hawk, a former professional wrestler; Boomer, trained in the martial arts; and Sledge, an ex-military convict. Together they must destroy members of the Dead End Gang to get to the leader, Faust, who knows where Kute Kate is being held.
With fists of fury, the Cobras make their way through various areas of Dead End City. They search the construction site for Kate, battling the humanic weapon The Missing Link to gain information. From there, they are sent on futile chases through other sections of the city, including downtown, the waterfront, and the slums, where the final confrontation with Faust takes place. Throughout the game, the Cobras can pick up special weapons and food for more energy. Each player also has his own 'special attack' method to help defeat the toughest enemies.
Once Kute Kate is rescued and Dead End City is liberated, the Cobras victoriously start back to their home turf. However, much to their surprise, the entrance to their town is blocked by Dead End Gang bosses. The Cobras must gear up once more for the ultimate showdown to restore peace to Dead End City.,
