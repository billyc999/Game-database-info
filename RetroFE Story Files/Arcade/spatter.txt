Spatter is a fast-moving maze-chase game in which the player takes on the role of a tricycle-pedalling child out collecting flowers, while trying to avoid collisions with the numerous enemies giving chase.
Most of the maze paths are seperated into two lanes, with a springy elastic fence seperating them. This fence is the key to playing the game, as players can jump into it, allowing them to squeeze past oncoming enemies in the same lane. Also, enemies on the opposite side of the fence can be sent flying from the track. Solid blocks also feature, and these can be pushed into enemies to destroy them.
Special bonus rounds feature after stages two, six, ten and fourteen. These rounds are platform-based, with the player trying to collect as many items of fruit as possible before heading up to the highest platform, to meet up with a friendly eldery lady who is waiting there. 'Fruit' and 'Happy' bonuses are then awarded.
