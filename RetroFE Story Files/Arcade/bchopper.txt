Clear 6 zones in all, including floating green islands, moving rock beds, underground clock towers, etc. The incidents which occur one after another are all caused by the psychic power of the muddy. The enemies you encounter on your way are pretty tough. Keep sharp watch for them though they look cute. This is an exciting airfight game with the charm of a cartoon.
