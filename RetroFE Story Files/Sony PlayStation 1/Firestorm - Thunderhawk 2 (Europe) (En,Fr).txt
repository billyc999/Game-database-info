This is the sequel to Core's Sega CD game, AH-3 Thunderstrike. Like the previous game in the series, this is a helicopter simulator/shooter. It features realistic features like multiple weapons selection, full freedom of movement, and a mission-based structure. On the other hand, it also throws lots and lots of enemy tanks and helicopters at you to blow up.  The graphics in Thunderstrike 2 are drawn completely with 3D polygons, including the helicopter's cockpit. As you track an enemy, the view changes so that it is always in your sights. There are 8 campaigns to complete, each with multiple missions.
