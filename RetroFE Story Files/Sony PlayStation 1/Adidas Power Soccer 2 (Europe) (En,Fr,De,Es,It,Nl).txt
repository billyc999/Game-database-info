adidas Power Soccer 2 is the second main game in the Psygnosis series and was made by a different development studio. Continuing the 3D gameplay from the first game, this title adds updated player and team databases for the 1997-1998 season, a new arcade mode where players can perform special moves, commentary by ITV's Brian Moore (UK), Yves Lecoq (France) and RTL's Marcel Reif (Germany), and eight new stadia fully rendered in 3D.

The title includes many real Premier League teams, in addition to 56 national teams and top clubs. Multiplayer is available for up to four players with a multitap.
