In Pocket Dogs , you interact with eight different dogs in an effort to improve your human-canine relationship. You'll be able to converse with your dog, with the dialogue changing depending on the species. You'll also be able to make the dog play games by sharing toys with it. As the player, you'll be able to play games for yourself via three mini games included in the title. By playing mini games players can win jewels which may be used to purchase items for their canine companion and decorate its living space. Featured breeds include the Pug, Chihuahua, and Shih Tzu. Pocket Dogs is developed in conjunction with the Hana Deka Club, a brand of toys and gifts featuring the signature cute dogs photographed with fisheye lenses.
