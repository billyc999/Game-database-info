Tecmo returns to the gridiron with this new version of Tecmo Super Bowl for 16-bit console systems. Play with real National Football League players and teams in this 2D, side-scrolling arcade game.  All of the features from the 8-bit game remain intact, with brand new ones added for even more electronic football fun!  

Additions include updated player rosters, options for weather effects (rain, snow), multiple season play (three regular season schedules available in all), adjustable game time length, and an offensive playbook that can be edited even during a game.
