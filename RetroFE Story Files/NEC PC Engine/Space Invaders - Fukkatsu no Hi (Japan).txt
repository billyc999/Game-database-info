The Invaders are back and tougher than ever! Space Invaders: Fukkatsu no Hi (Day of Resurrection) is an update of the iconic game from Taito. The game features updated graphics and nearly a dozen different weapon types, as well as a much wider variety of enemy Invaders to shoot down.

Also included is a conversion of the original 1978 coin-op.
