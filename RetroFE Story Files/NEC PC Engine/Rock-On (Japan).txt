You are a Buster and your mission is to make your fortune by finding FISA (Mysterious Fortune Hidden by the Ancient People) in your flying craft over various levels. At the start you are just armed with a small cannon and move slowly but scattered around each level are icons which can improve your weaponry and speed. These include 2-way, 3-way, laser and back-fire. The whole world will be watching on TV to see if you can succeed.  Rock-On is a horizontal side scrolling shoot 'em up moving from left to right.
