The story of this game is rather simple: Tokyo has been destroyed by monsters! Terrifying creatures have invaded the city and ruined it. A scientist who possesses the secret knowledge of psychic powers known as ESP, imbues a young boy with them, and sends him to the streets and underground caverns of Tokyo, to rescue the few remaining survivors, and find out the source of the monstrous invasion!

Energy is a side-scrolling shooter. The player manipulates the young hero, who can shoot energy balls and jump. The energy attacks deplete his ESP bar, which refills itself gradually afterwards. The hero's life bar can only be refilled with healing potions which are sometimes dropped by the enemies. The boy can also collect items which change the properties or his ESP attack, and/or upgrade these attacks to the next level.
