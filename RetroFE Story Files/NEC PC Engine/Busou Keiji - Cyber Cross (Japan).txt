Robots and insectoid creatures are trying to take over the world. You play a man who has the ability to turn into Cyber Cross and stop these evil creatures. As you punch and kick your way across the side view scrolling game you can collect coloured pods and turn into Cyber Cross. The colour of the pod decides which power you have. Red is a sword, blue is a laser gun and a boomerang is green. Hold down a button and releasing it gives you a special attack. Get hit three times as Cyber Cross and you lose your suit. As well as the main playing area you can also see your score, lives, time, health meter and your special weapon meter.
