Zero4 Champ is a racing simulation game inspired by Japanese urban street racing, its name derived from the traditional racing distance (0 to 400 meters). A versus mode allows players to compete against each other or computer AI in first-person-view races; however, the game's main mode is the Story Mode, which has strong simulation elements. The player takes the role of a young racer, competing in tournaments and gradually advancing in rank. It is possible to buy car parts or whole vehicles, as well as customize cars. Money is obtained from prizes or by doing part-time jobs. These jobs are sometimes designed as mini-games; for example, working as a security guard involves inspecting rooms in a first-person environment. It is also possible to play simple arcade games such as UFO catcher or Turbo Racing.
