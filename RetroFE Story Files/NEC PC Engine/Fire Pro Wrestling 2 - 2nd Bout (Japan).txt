Fire Pro Wrestling 2nd Bout is the second game in the Fire Pro Wrestling series. It is very similar to Fire Pro Wrestling Combination Tag and doesn't offer much in terms of new content, other than a few new modes, including Excite Series, World Champion Series, Super Tournament, and Elimination Match.
