Converted from Sega's arcade original, Altered Beast is a side-scrolling beat 'em up where you take the role of a warrior who has been resurrected to fight an evil sorcerer. With a setting that mixes fantasy with Greek myth, you can easily see the influence of Ray Harryhausen movies like Jason and the Argonauts and Clash of the Titans. Your quest takes you over many areas from swamps to caves, and each is populated with the denizens of evil who are all out to get you. To aid you in your fight, there are white two-headed wolves. If you destroy one of these, it releases a power orb which, when collected, boosts your muscle power. These power-ups have two initial stages, with your sprite getting beefier with each one, but once three are collected you transform into a wild and powerful beast. These beasts vary from level to level, but range from a fireball-hurling wolf to a dragon with a powerful electric shock attack.
