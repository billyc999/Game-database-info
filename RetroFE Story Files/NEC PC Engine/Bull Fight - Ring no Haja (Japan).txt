Bullfight: Ring no Hasha is a boxing game in which the player takes part in a competition with eight boxers. The tournament consists of four fights and a finale and each boxer can be controlled by a human player. The boxers have different statistics (strength, agility and endurance) which can be improved between fights with a training fight. Each boxer has four moves (left swing, right swing, uppercut and dodge) and a hit both depletes the opponent's energy bar and gives points. Similar to real boxing, those points are used to determine the winner if no boxer is knocked out during the regular rounds. A knockout happens when the energy runs out, but when the player mashes a button fast enough when the boxer is given a count, he stands up again with a partly replenished energy bar. Additionally there is also a side-scrolling fighting game included. Here the player walks from left to right and fights enemies in martial arts melee combat.
