Jinmu Densho is a game based on the style of Space Harrier where you play a Samurai who must run and jump into the screen to destroy evil creatures who run and fly at you from a distance with your sword. You do have the ability to run back on yourself, though, and later levels have platform jumping action. Scattered along the way are statues, which, when broken, allow you to collect health or shurikens that you can throw at distant enemies.
