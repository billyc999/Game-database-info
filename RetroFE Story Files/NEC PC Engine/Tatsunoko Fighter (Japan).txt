Tatsu no Ko Fighter comes from the Ghouls 'n' Ghosts school of thought - make the game damn hard and frustrating, make the player replay levels over and over until they do it and (thankfully) give them infinite continues so it's not THAT unfair. But while Ghouls 'n' Ghosts is visually interesting and has great music, this isn't and doesn't. Graphics are plain, though not as simplistic as a lot of games of this type and therefore moderately attractive, sound is average with nothing that sticks in your head, but there's something about the difficulty that just puts you off. Most games have a learning curve that starts off very easy then ramps up, but this is pretty tricky from the beginning. After the first few levels, you'll soon be cursing the screen and reaching for the power switch. It almost has a furious addictiveness to it, but not quite - the drive to get further is somehow missing. If you like very hard and annoying platformers, then you could do worse, but most people won't be willing to put the effort in as the rewards are just not there.
