Kattobi! Takuhai-kun ("Fury! Delivery Boy") is a top-down action/driving game from Advance Communications Company and Tonkin House. The player is a delivery boy who must make a series of increasingly surreal deliveries across town, occasionally leaving the country and getting into trouble with drug trafficking. As the player complete jobs, they can use their earnings to buy better two-wheeled delivery vehicles, upgrading from a pedal bike to a moped to a state-of-the-art motorcycle. Destroying their vehicle (by losing a life) drops them back down to the regular pedal bike.  The game was released exclusively in Japan on the PC Engine. It is perhaps best known to western audiences for its appearance on an episode of the Japanese video game TV show GameCenter CX.
