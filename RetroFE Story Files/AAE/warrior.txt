The first one-on-one fighting game, Warrior was a 2-player overhead sword-fighting contest. Brilliant vector graphics and incredibly beautful backdrop and internal cabinet artwork made the game enthralling to watch, producing more complex images than Atari's vector hardware was capable of. Unfortunately, the Cinematronics vector system was also far less reliable. Most Cinematronics vector games are rare, and Warrior is rare among them."
