A "Deluxe" version of Atari's original Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe swaps the vector graphics for bitmaps. The basic gameplay is still the same: You fly your triangular ship around a space which wraps around the edges, filled with asteroids. Shooting the asteroids splits them into two smaller ones, until they are small enough to be destroyed. If you collide with an asteroid, you're dead, unless you activate your forcefield which will bounce the ship off the asteroids. Sometimes, a flying saucer flies through the screen, shooting everywhere. Additional asteroid shapes also show up, such as the blue target-seeking hexagons which split up into smaller triangular missiles.
