Space Wars is an action game where two space ships battle each other. The game control is similar to Asteroids: you move by thrusting and rotating your ship left or right, you can fire in the direction you're facing, or enter hyperspace to randomly relocate your ship on the screen. If you can successfully destroy your opponent, a point is earned and the first player to reach 10 points wins the game. Besides the two ships, other obstacles are on the screen: a meteorite floats about randomly and in the center of the screen is a sun, both of which can destroy your ship. Two players can battle each other, or one player can battle the computer and several skill levels are available.
