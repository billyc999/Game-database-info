 The object of the game is not only to rescue Kimberly, but also help Dexter regain his manhood by becoming Ace again, destroying the Infanto Ray, defeating Borf and saving the Earth. As you journey through outer space on this perilous quest, you will encounter all kinds of dangers with enemy spaceships, alien creatures and other nemesis.You make all the decisions on the game as you direct either Dexter or Ace with the joystick depending where you are at. The button does not only make Dexter or Ace fire his blaster, but it can also transform Dexter into Ace at certain parts of the game whenever the word "Energize" appears on the screen, but that is only if you choose to do so.If you make it to the end of the game, Dexter will be Ace again for good, he and Kimberly will be reunited, Borf will be turned into a baby by his own weapon (now destroyed) and the Earth will be safe. Afterwards, the game ends. Contrary to popular belief, both Dragon's Lair and Space Ace did contain diagonal movements. In some cases, these movements were simply the combination of two acceptable moves, while in other cases the diagonal move was distinct (for example, during the whirlpool segment in Dragon's Lair moving right or left is acceptable, moving diagonal up-right or up-left is acceptable, but simply moving up results in death). In all cases, the diagonal moves were optional, and there was always a 4-way alternative. The '91 re-release of Space Ace contained some diagonal moves that were required.
