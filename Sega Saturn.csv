A+M+O+K (USA)>A+M+O+K>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>SEGA Corporation>Lemon>Shooter>3.9>1-2 Players>"Amok portrays a futuristic storyline on a planet which is identified in the manual as having the same name. There, two gigantic corporations, referred to by the acronyms NONLUN and AZTK, had previously been having an all-out war between them for forty-seven years. The war had involved all possible fronts and theaters, including operations in the air, on the surface of the land and sea, and beneath the water. Very recently, a weak peace accord had only just been reached. In the manual, the peace accord is described as being much like ""a blanket covering the fire that smolders in the hearts of the people."" The agreement is sufficiently unsteady that an influential mercenary company, known only as ""the Bureau,"" has now decided to hire a capable battle walker pilot named Gert Staun to restart the war so they can continue to make large amounts of money by taking lucrative contracts from both sides. The player takes the role of Gert Staun.****Naturally ""the Bureau"" has placed a high priority on this, and they are funding it entirely on their own. Indeed, Gert Staun's battle walker, called the ""Slambird"" is explicitly said to be custom-modified. In particular, the Slambird can not only survive either on land or underwater, but it can transition between the two -- it can move, fight, and safely control its vertical position in either environment. These abilities are portrayed as costly and not standard to such vehicles in the universe where Amok takes place. The transformation of the Slambird between an underwater vehicle and a land vehicle is automatically scripted, however. The player  has no power to control this transformation or alter the time when it happens. Instead, the player must get to the point when Staun will automatically bring the Slambird ashore to continue his attacks.****The object of this arcade-type game is to meet a series of objectives, and to do so in such a way that each side will blame the other. The game has a linear structure, based on levels that present tasks of increasing difficulty, and all sorts of hazards and targets are encountered. These include military bases, power generators, land mines, infantry, tanks, submarines -- even sharks and huge, aggressive birds. Infantry elements are poorly armored, so they can be killed by being run over. In one mission, the only way that the player will be able to get enough time to escape is to open with a surprise attack, slowing pursuit by destroying a parking facility full of unattended troop transport vehicles. Power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. The Slambird carries a variety of explosive devices and line-of-sight weapons. Some of the explosive weapons can bounce in a parabolic trajectory, and in addition there are two laser cannons that can fire rapidly an unlimited number of times. These cannons are useful in case no other weapons remain, and they can be used to create complex ripple fire, which can be used to cover an area that is surprisingly wide. When underwater, propellers are used, while torpedoes are automatically used instead of missiles."

However the dark magic which keeps them immortal also requires Jack and his crew to regularly make human sacrifices (which explains Grace's kidnapping).****Now Carnby must battle his way through Hell's Kitchen and Jack's army of tommy-gun wielding gangsters, searching for a way to break the spell and make them stay dead. ****Alone in the Dark 2 is an action-adventure game, similar to the original Alone in the Dark.

Betsy has a huge number of toys that come to life in the absence of humans and normally play nicely with each other. In the opening introduction, the somewhat inept clockwork knight Pepperouchau is competing with some other knights for the affections of a princess who lives in the clock. Everyone is having a grand time until a rogue toy shows up through the air vent, absconds with the princess, and turns many of the other toys against Pepperouchau.****The gameplay consists of side scrolling action through various stages constructed of elaborate series of toys, traps, and common household items. The first stage is a quest through Betsy's room with lots of letter blocks, sharp crayons, and dollhouses precariously balanced on robots that tend to fall on you. Pepperouchau is armed with a key sword that has offensive use as well as the ability to open boxes that functions as warps to other areas. The second stage takes place in Betsy's brother's room. Kevin has a lot of engineering skill and has built an impressive network of cranes and trains that Pepperouchau will need to activate in order to clear the area. Watch out for the jet transformer boss at the end of the room.****Other stages include missions through other areas of the house including the kitchen and the attic. Throughout the game you also collect coins. 20 coins are worth a continue when you run out of lives. Further, you meet other friendly toys between levels who give you the opportunity to gamble with your earned coins.

It maintains the same game style (a mixture of 2D side-scrolling platformer with 3D elements, moderately in the fashion of Sega Saturn's Bug!), colorful music and gameplay of its predecessor. However, your mission will be somewhat different this time (although still related with Clockwork Princess Chelsea), as the ending scene of the first game did not come as good as expected and because of that, you should try to give the best of yourself again in order to completely recover Chelsea for Pepperouchau.

You alone survived. It is clear that the Silencer is being silenced... and the only place to turn is the Resistance... ****Crusader: No Remorse is the first in the series, which is best described as a 2D isometric shooter. Your silencer can roll left, roll right, kneel, jump, run, and perform other acrobatic moves.

You're up against the full military might of the WEC, from simple guards to full-fledged Guardmechs and elite forces (though none are quite as good as you). You can find supplies and money off of killed enemies (if you left a body, that is, and some of the extreme weapons don't). You'll often need to bypass traps, open doors, disable alarms, take out security cameras, and more. The action is intense, and there's usually a bit of puzzle involved. It's often a matter of exploring the map to find a switch or a terminal with the code that'll let you access another part or another level of the map. ****Between missions you can chat in the Resistance base and/or buy/sell weapons. You can also find recharge stations to replenish your energy and health (you can also find batteries and first aid kits too). The missions range from simple sabotage to rescue.

Daytona USA - Championship Circuit Edition (USA)>Daytona USA - Championship Circuit Edition>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>AM2>Driving>3.7>1-2 Players>All of its predecessor and then some.  More tracks, many more cars (hidden cars as well), smarter AI, more music (no more lyrics for the in-game race music either), broader 2-player gameplay, more refined arcade physics...and on top of everything else- BETTER GRAPHICS!  The first Daytona on the Saturn boasted some hefty visuals, great for displaying the Saturn's power to the masses at the console's birth; but for the Saturn to be revered for everything it was, Sega (and AM2) had to make something a little flashier.  All the graphics in the game have been updated...both the cars and tracks have higher polygon count, better texture mapping; the framerate is QUITE noticeably improved, everything is very smooth.
Daytona USA (USA)>Daytona USA>1995>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Sega AM2>Driving>3.9>1 Player>A port of the most successful arcade racer ever, the home versions of Daytona USA include the same elements that made the original version successful: three highly detailed tracks, arcade driving physics that challenge the player to find the best trajectory to make a flying lap without kissing the rails and beating the checkpoint timer. The 40 cars of the Easy race (later named 3-7 Speedway), one of the stalwarts of the original version, are also present in this version.****These home versions include a new mode (Saturn or PC Mode, depending on the platform) where the three tracks are played without the timer, and optionally in mirror mode, using one of the bonus cars (with additional abilities such as driving on grass or hitting the rails without losing speed) and in one of three lengths: Normal (identical to the arcade original), Grand Prix (2.5 times longer) and Endurance (10 times longer). ****On the downside, detail and frame rate suffered a drop to fit the game into the limited hardware of the Saturn and Personal Computers, and lacking any kind of multiplayer, comparing to the two to eight player rumbles of the arcade version.

Each character has their own unique way of fighting, their own abilities, and even their own hobbies and likes.  (For example, Ryu Hayabusa- yes, he of Ninja Gaiden fame- likes sushi, mountain climbing, and fishing.)
Decathlete (USA)>Decathlete>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Corporation>Sega>Sports/Olympic>3.6>1-2 Players>Sega's own version of Decathlon, the most grueling of multi-event sports consisting of the 100-Meter Dash, Long Jump, Shot Put, High Jump, 400-Meter Race,  110-Meter Hurdles, Discus Throw,   Pole Vault, Javelin Throw and the 1500-Meter Race, split over two days of competition. Featuring eight athletes with different abilities and specialties, from the agile Karl Vain and Femi Kadiena, the fast Li Huang and Ellen Reggiani, the well balanced Joe Kudou and Rick Blade to the powerhouses Aleksei Rigel and Jef Jansens, the player must achieve the best scores possible in each event to get to the World's best results table, not only in the decathlon points table but also on the individual events table.****All events follow the core gameplay of other athletics titles (such as Track & Field), with some changes from event to event. Spriting events such as the  100-meter dash are pure button-bashing, with the 110-Meter Hurdles requiring an additional tap in the action button to pass the athlete at the correct time over the hurdle without losing speed or knocking it down. At the opposite level, the 400-Meter and the 1500-Meter Race add a stamina bar that must be kept above critical levels at all times to keep the athlete fresh until the end, this being done by simply pacing the number of presses done by the player (the 1500M also requires the player to steer the athlete in the best path: as close as possible to the inside edge without hitting other runners or losing speed from going over the edge). Jumping events, along the javelin, require a fast build-up, an well-timed action (be it jump, set the pole or release the javelin), and setting the most appropriate angle. Discus is the only event where button mashing isn't required, and asks the player to rotate the D-pad clockwise to build strenght, followed by a push of the action button to set the angle of release as well as the direction. ****Like in the original ST-V version (which means it is in every way similar to the arcade version), two players can compete at the same time in the running event, and at the 1500M race six drones compete at the same time.
Deep Fear (Europe) (Disc 1)>Deep Fear  Disk 1>1998>ESRB - M (Mature)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Sega>Adventure>4.4>1 Player>All contact is lost with a submarine on a routine mission which then crashes into an underwater facility.

The crew are mutating due to an alien parasite and members of the search team have to figure out what is happening and how to stop it!**** The game is played via a third person view which is just behind the character and you look over his shoulder. The game is based underwater in a submarine so the developers have added a claustrophobic feeling by giving some areas a limited amount of air so you have to run through to activate the air circulation system.

You play as an engineer sent to update one such base. Just after uploading the automating code, the base is suddenly invaded by unknown assailants from the air and ground. You must rely on your wits and the defence software to fend them off.****The main game takes place in a first-person view inside the complex. Trams connect the maze-like living areas to a handful of manned turrets outside. You must shuttle between shooting down waves of fighters in the turrets, and scouring the base levels for card keys during the down time.****A third consideration is the ""Virtual Operating System"" controlling all major base functions. You use this interface to repair damage from attacks, monitor intruders, and place robot sentries to guard key passages. As you find more access keys, you can increase the software's efficiency to the point that you can command turrets remotely, or set them to auto-attack with a high degree of success. ****As defending the base becomes more automated and efficient, you have more time to search the levels for keys. Your ultimate goal is to find the clearance to self-destruct the base, defend your escape shuttle, and get out alive."

Dragon Ball Z - The Legend (Europe)>Dragon Ball Z - The Legend>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Bandai S.A.>BEC>Fighter>2.4>1-2 Players>Dragon Ball Z - The Legend is a game that adds another Dragon Ball to the franchise of the same name and starts with the events of the Saiyan Saga and the fight with Vegeta and Nappa. In Idainaru Dragon Ball Densetsu you don’t have your natural one on one fights. At the beginning of each fight you are given a total of 4 fighters (up to 6 later) from which you have to choose the 3 that you would like to participate in the battle that follows. Each fighter has 2 bars – a green and a yellow one. The green represents the life force and the yellow the power force which is depleted with every attack you do. At the bottom of the screen there is a blue bar and a red one that form a gauge called Power Balance. The reason for this gauge to be there is because your attacks don’t affect the enemies’ life bar directly. By continuously attacking the enemy the bar that represents your power (blue bar) increases while that of the enemy (red bar) decreases. When the blue bar covers all the gauge a random attack sequence, from the current character you’re controlling, is initiated and that’s how you can actually injure your opponents. The same can happen to you though if the enemy’s red bar covers all the gauge.

Fighting Vipers has drastically different gameplay than the more popular Virtua Fighter 2.  Instead of being sophisticated, Fighting Vipers is simplified to appeal to a wider audience of video gamers and was meant for ""casual"" gamers.****Mixing a simplistic video game and a sophisticated video game must have been difficult.

The most important option available is the choice of having Fighters Megamix run under the Fighting Vipers style of gameplay or the Virtua Fighter 2 style of gameplay.  Other options are unlockable while playing the game.****One good thing about mixing two games into one is that the game would include more selectable characters.  Not only are there the 22 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers but there are also 10 other hidden characters that can be unlocked by playing well in the Saturn version, including two from the arcade-only Sonic the Fighters.

Once the armour is gone, the unfortunate fighter is more vulnerable to opponent hits, and damage can also be collected after hitting the wall or floor after a throw. ****Gameplay is also radically different from Virtua Fighter - noticeably  faster, with combos done by fast button-mashing sequences sometimes on the same button, instead of the timed presses that require an additional push on the d-pad of the first title. Another new addition to gameplay is the Quick recovery, which allows a fighter that suffered a severe blow to quickly get on his feet, avoiding damage and allowing for a quick counter, but at the same time leaving him open for another blow if the opponent is fast enough. to react.****Game modes include Arcade, Vs, Team Battle (best of 9) and Training.

For some reason Death Adder decided to set up a Street Fighter-like tournament to give his enemies an opportunity to slay him and prevent the end of the world.****The game play formula follows Street Fighter 2 closely with several playable characters that are essentially the same as the cast of the original Golden Axe (for all extents and purposes).****It’s essentially an elimination tournament with each character having special moves similar to that of Street Fighter 2 characters. You can play against another player or against the computer. It does feature scaling backgrounds similar to Samurai Shodown.
Grand Slam (USA)>Grand Slam>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Inc.>Burst Studios>Sports/Baseball>2.8>1-2 Players>Grand Slam Baseball was an innovative, albeit relatively low-key release from Virgin Interactive Entertainment in 1997.****Not known for sports games, VIE released Grand Slam for Windows, Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn as the second title in its attempt to establish a mainstream sports line. The first title in the short-lived line was Power Play Hockey in 1996. The sports line would last only one more title after Grand Slam's release, that being the sequel to the hockey game, also released in 1997.****Grand Slam was one of the early adopters of 3D accelerator card technology and also offered full 3D play in software alone. The Playstation and Saturn versions were 3D by default.****Grand Slam introduced a few play mechanics to video game baseball that would later prove to be fixtures in the genre. The most notable in this area was the introduction of a meter for pitching, used to control the velocity and accuracy of pitches, similar to the familiar swing meter in popular golf games. This meter was later borrowed and made popular by titles such as EA's MVP Baseball. On the batting side of things, a similar metered approach was used. This was inspired by older arcade baseball games that allowed the player to load up a swing's power with a control stick before releasing it as the pitch came in.****Other highlights amongst Grand Slam's feature set included:****- A trade AI engine that would examine the needs of a team and decide if a proposed trade was in its best interest.****- Catcher AI and pitch signals, helping a player learn how to pitch to each batter's strengths and weaknesses.****- Attention to details and baseball flavor, such as players that would blow bubble gum bubbles during an at bat, light- hearted commentary, an All Star Break during season play (complete with a working voting ballot), and an in-game JumboTron scoreboard that would show animations after home runs.

Guardian Heroes (USA)>Guardian Heroes>1996>ESRB - T (Teen)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Treasure>Role-Playing>3.8>1-6 Players>"Treasure's unique scrolling beat-em-up/RPG hybrid, Guardian Heroes introduces the player to a motley crew of heroes (Consisting of a swordsman, a ninja, a cleric and a mage), formed to find a ""legendary sword"". The game begins with the heroes in a bar, having found this sword, as they decide what to do with it. Before they have a chance to come up with an idea however, they are interrupted as an Imperial General charges in and warns them they are in grave danger. Seconds later, Imperial troops swarm into the inn and the heroes are forced to take flight along with this general.****The fighting mechanic is slightly deeper than the average scrolling beat-em-up, with light and heavy attacks, special moves (executed the same way you'd expect a normal beat-em-up to work), magical attacks and the ability to block. As you defeat enemies you gain experience points, with which you can upgrade your character between levels - sharing them between various factors such as strength, speed, constitution and magic resistance.****Even more interesting however is the hugely branching storyline, which changes according to decisions you make (of which there are many) and which character you select to play with.****Also of note is the fact that even in one-player mode there are always two of you on screen - you command the other character by changing his ""mood"" - aggressive, cowardly etc. - of which there are six. On top of this, it is possible to play the game as a more traditional beat-em-up with up to six players/bots, and in this mode you can play as any character that you have encountered during the main game mode."

Each one has four unique weapons and different levels of speed and armor.****The hub system steps away from the traditional ""single levels stringed along into episodes"" system which had been carried over into the FPS genre from sidescrollers and made popular by Wolfenstein 3D. In Hexen's hub system each episode is still made up of interconnected levels, but most of the levels are connected to a single ""hub"" level through portals. There are also portals between some of the ""spoke"" levels. Many of the puzzles in Hexen require travel back and forth between different levels.****Other innovations in Hexen included weather effects, jumping, earth-quakes, and destructible objects such as trees and vases."

The game has 50 levels, called ""worlds""; each of those is set in a sea terrain with several mountainous islands. Your goal on each level is to amass enough mana within your castle to ""restore the equilibrium"" within the world. Once this happens, you can head to the next level. ****To collect mana, you have to find it (it is represented by golden spheres) and cast a specific spell to make it ""yours"". To collect this mana, you have to use a special spell to raise a castle of your own out of the ground. A balloon will appear over the newly created castle; it will proceed to fly around the level and collect ""your"" mana. Initially, your castle will be small and won't be able to hold much mana, so you'll have to keep casting the ""castle"" spell at it to make it bigger. ****The levels typically have monsters and rival mages in them. Not only they can hurt you with their attacks, but killing them is often necessary, as upon death they will release some of the mana you need to complete the level. To attack your enemies, you have a variety of spells at your disposal: fireballs, lightning bolts and meteors. ****There are also many other spells available to you - they allow you to heal yourself, surround yourself with a protective shield, teleport around, summon a skeleton army, or even modify the terrain by creating volcanoes and splitting landmasses. Not all spells are available to you from the beginning, though. ****Throughout all the levels, you are on your flying carpet, which can move in 3 dimensions. You can bring up a top-down map at any time."

The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter to Quake's realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless hordes of monsters, and exact revenge.****id Software's followup to Doom and Doom II, ""Quake"" is a first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.****In single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id's earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.****Unlike Doom's rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake's levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military base (with a technological 'slipgate' as the level exit), later levels take place in environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom's colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by earth colors.****The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player's weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel.  Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical energy.****Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs. The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode. One-on-one duels, team play and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game also comes with six maps especially designed for deathmatch."

Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.****There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class.****If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.****The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu."
Robo Pit (USA)>Robo Pit>1996>ESRB - T (Teen)>Kokopeli Digital Studios>Altron>Platform>4.0>1-2 Players>"Robo Pit is an arena fighter, plain and simple. Well, maybe not so simple. When you start your game, you have to build your mechanical gladiator; choosing the color, body, eyes and legs. While most of your starting choices are purely cosmetic, the legs you choose do slightly affect your game by changing the speed and mobility of your fighter, as well as its special attack.****Once you've created your robotic brawler, it's time to start climbing the ranks. To progress, you have to fight the robot that's occupying the rank above yours. Once you beat them, you get to take an arm and then move up. The game continues on in this fashion until you've bested all of the other combatants. However, a few curve-balls are thrown your way as you climb the ladder. For starters, there are several different arms you can acquire; from swords and shields to cannons and lasers, and the more you use them, the faster and more effective (i.e. damaging) they are. On top of that, even so often a sort of ""boss"" robot is put in your way. These ""bosses"" use special weapons that only they have access to. Until you pound them into scrap and take them, that is. These weapons can be incredibly powerful if you stick with them, making the rest of the fighters, save number one, a breeze. As an added bonus, you can even save your cyber-combatant to a memory card and bring it to a friend's house for some one-on-one let's-see-who-has-the-best-robot fighting goodness!****The arenas themselves are fairly basic, but they are varied, offering up different layout and obstacles to take cover behind or use to get the drop on your opponent. They also have ledges, and like most fighting games a ring-out means an instant loss. As for the fighting, it's simple, but effective. Square and circle attack with the left and right arms, X jumps and triangle triggers your special (which has to charge of course). Of course different weapons have different ranges and timing, which will also improve the more you use them."
Robotica (USA)>Robotica>1995>ESRB - T (Teen)>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.>Genki>Action>3.2>1 Player>Robotica was the first firstperson shooter for the platform and a first generation game for the console. It is somewhat similar to Space Hulk, only that the player takes the role of a machine that rebels against the robots to save mankind. The weapons include a punch, Vulcan gun, Missiles, and Lasers. The main environment is made up of various hallways. The player runs through the various stages collecting keys, using computers, and triggering lights. The enemies are relatively basic but are dangerous in numbers.****The game is set in 2877, 800 years after the world's peacekeeping unions have collapsed. They are replaced with World Silent Security Service, a global world order to maintain the security on earth and in space. However, over time the role of the order is questioned, and the Reformist Faction rebel group sends three pilots in Laocorn assault robots to the WSSS' space station Daedalus in earth's orbit. Two are immediately destroyed, but the player gets to control the remaining robot.

Scorcher (USA)>Scorcher>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Scavenger, Inc.>Zyrinx>Driving>3.2>1 Player>Scorcher is a futuristic racing game by Scavenger. In dark post-war-looking decors, you race against a couple of opponents driving in a spherical racer. You can pick up special triangles to gain speed powerups.****The graphics support resolutions up to 640x480.
Scud - The Disposable Assassin (USA)>Scud - The Disposable Assassin>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>SegaSoft, Inc.>Syrox Developments>Shooter>4.2>1-2 Players>"You play the game as Scud, a ""disposable assassin"", who has been hired to take out a target in the ""Marvin's Manikan"" factory.  Based on the underground comic by Rob Schrab, Scuds are designed to self destruct after they have destroyed their target... Scud has become aware of this fact, and instead only injures his target enough to not self-destruct.  But, being a robot, Scud has no money, and must turn to freelance jobs to pay for his original target's life support.****The game can be played with either a controller or the Virtua Stunner (or other compatible light gun).  With a controller, the game is a side scrolling shoot-em-up; but with a light gun, it becomes a first person shooter.  You can play with any combination of controllers and guns, but the game is essentially meant to be played with two guns (Scud himself uses two guns).****The game is fueled by music from ""DJR/IB3 LTD."" (Darryl J. Reavis &amp; Illuminado Berrios, III), Fidget-X, and Unbelievable Jolly Machine"

Sega Ages (USA)>Sega Ages>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SPAZ>Rutubo Games>Multiplay>4.6>1 Player>A collection of three of Sega's most popular arcade games of the 1980s, translated for the Sega Saturn - Outrun, After Burner II and Space Harrier.****In Outrun, get behind the wheel of your Ferrari and reach the checkpoints in time. Choose your destination as the road forks, and make sure you make it to the finish line before the timer reads zero.****After Burner II allows you to fly the most feared jet fighter in the skies - the SSF-14 - and annihilate the enemy. With two Vulcan guns, heat seaking missiles and an afterburner, as well as support from the crew of the aircraft carrier Sega Enterprise, the object is to shoot the enemy from the sky - before they get you.****Space Harrier is a shoot 'em up set in a fantasy future world. Armed with a gun and a jet pack, it is your job to rid Dragonland of the demon Absymbel and his evil forces.
Sega Rally Championship (USA)>Sega Rally Championship>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Sega>Driving>4.1>1-2 Players>Sega Rally was a major success in the arcades, bringing rally-style racing to the masses before the Colin McRae games. Four detailed tracks have been created, with a succession of stomach-churning bends and jumps, and you can choose from 3 different cars. As well as the main championship, there is a time-trial mode featuring a ghost car to beat, so you always know how your run compares with your best-ever. Two machines can be linked for multi-player action. The handling of the cars is unrealistic, to put the focus on action and instant playability.
Sega Touring Car Championship (USA)>Sega Touring Car Championship>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Europe Ltd.>Sega>Driving>3.5>1-2 Players>"After Virtua Racing, Daytona USA and Sega Rally, yet another classic SEGA arcade racer (this time, from the Model 2C CRX architecture) is converted for home users. After open-wheel, stock and rally cars, Sega took on the popular European Touring Car races (factory models modified for racing), featuring four real models (Alfa Romeo 155V6TI, Toyota Supra GT, AMG Mercedes C-Class and Opel Calibra V6) as well as some hidden cars. Some models feature four-wheel drive (easier to control on sharper turns) while other only have rear-wheel drive (forcing the player to calculate turns properly so the car doesn't skid). Because of this, gameplay is notoriously tighter and less forgiving than in any of the previous titles by Sega. ****Like with other Sega arcade ports, this home versions features both an ""Arcade"" and a ""PC""/""Saturn"" mode (the biggest difference being the time constraints and inability to use tweaked cars in arcade) with the usual Championship (three races in a row) and Time Attack modes, and a 2P split-screen race is also available. There are three tracks, plus one more as the final race (as usual with contemporary Sega arcade racers), and two viewpoints (behind and front bumper) are at the disposal of the player.**As usual, there are additional modes, tracks and cars to be unlocked for those proficient in the game.****Another feature was the ""Global Ranking"" mode, where players of either version could e-mail Sega of Japan a password containing his times, and compare them to the World's finest players, as well as in special one-day only ""Global Net Events""."
Sega Worldwide Soccer '97 (USA)>Sega Worldwide Soccer '97>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Sega>Sports/Soccer>4.2>1-4 Players>Well, it's a soccer game made by Sega but with an arcade-like style of gameplay. So the handling is kept pretty straight-forward: one button for a shot towards the enemy goal (from any position on the field), one for passing to teammates and one for lobbing. But  simple doesn't mean limited since a couple of things are not explained in the manual and you'll have to figure them out yourself, which can take some time.**You can choose between dozens of national teams from all over the world. Player names are made up since there's no Fifa license or anything but they're editable if you feel like correcting that. Game modes include Exhibition, Tournament, League or World Cup. You can play either versus the CPU, vs. up to 2 human players or even coop (2 humans vs. the CPU or other 2 humans).
Sega Worldwide Soccer '98 (USA)>Sega Worldwide Soccer '98>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Sega>Sports/Soccer>4.1>1-4 Players>Sega Worldwide Soccer 98 picks up where its predecessor stopped, adding two new stadiums, new animations, faster gameplay, and the most important, club teams from England, Spain and France for a total of 60 teams adding to the 48 of the International mode. While the game still lacks a license (except the English league, that has real player and team names), the name editor is still present. In the commentary box, Gary Bloom is joined by former England international and 1966 World Cup winner Jack Charlton. ****There are seven games modes: Friendly match, Club exhibition, Worldwide Cup, Club League, Cup Tournament and Penalty shootout.
Shanghai - Triple Threat (USA)>Shanghai - Triple Threat>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Activision, Inc.>Activision>Board Games>4.5>1-2 Players>"Another version of the ancient game of Mah-Jong. The player is presented with an arrangement of tiles, lined up together and stacked, with either 2 or 4 of each of an array of patterns. These must be removed by matching pairs, but only tiles which are visible and have a space to the left or right can be removed.****This release in the Activision's Shanghai series includes three games along with the Classic Shanghai.  In The Great Wall, the tiles are stacked vertically, and fall when lower tiles are removed, a lá Tetris. In Beijing, gaps are created to slide groups of tiles along. The Golden Tile sees two players attempt to clear a set layout at once.  The Triple-theme continues with three game modes: Solitaire, 2-player ""Pandamonium"", and Arcade.  Three themed tile sets complete the ""Triple Threat""."
Shellshock (USA)>Shellshock>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>U.S. Gold, Inc.>Core Design Ltd.>Action>2.9>1 Player>Da Wardenz, an anti-terrorist tank force, is called in whenever there is trouble somewhere in the world. You are a rookie hired by the tank force and must prove yourself in 25 increasingly difficult missions.****'The Pen' is Da Wardenz' headquarters. It has all sorts of locations including the main hangar, basketball court, simulation room, workshop area, briefing room and various lockers (used for loading and saving missions). Before a mission, you can explore the headquarters and interact with each member of the team; you may learn something.****When you start a mission, the action is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has you controlling the M-13 Predator, a highly sophisticated and upgradable tank. The game is arcade-oriented and has much more in common with 'Quarantine' and 'Doom' than serious counterparts like 'M1 Tank Platoon'.**Your tank has unlimited bullets, can sustain heavy damage and can destroy enemies but also trees and buildings.****When a mission is successfully completed you earn cash which you can spend on repairing your tank and extra upgrades.
Shining Force III (USA)>Shining Force III>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Camelot Software Planning>Strategy>3.8>1 Player>"Set in a world of fantasy and magic, Shining Force III places you in the boots of a young general, fighting to preserve the peace in your world. The story starts out as the Emperor is abducted from within the city of Saraband, and you must go on the run with your king, who is suspected of being the mastermind behind the abduction. Of course, things are not as they seem, and you will be taken through a web of lies and deceit in your quest to prove the King innocent.****The game is very similar in style to the earlier Shining Force titles, so anyone who's played them will be comfortable with the game, though likely they'll also be happy to find the game graphically overhauled, with a 3-D landscape and 3D characters during the battle animations. As ever the main game is controlled like a traditional RPG, with you controlling the main character, talking to NPC's and searching various items. However, the main selling point of the Shining Force series has always been its battle sequences. ****The combat system is amended from the earlier titles, with a new and unique ""friendship"" system, whereby the more two characters work together (helping each other out, healing each other etc.) the closer they bond, and they will start to give each other bonuses on the battlefield. Other traditional features, such as the rock-paper-scissors nature of the weapons (sword beats axe, axe beats spear, spear beats sword etc.) and the terrain effects (someone hiding in a forest is going to get better protection than someone on an open road) remain fully intact, and anyone who's played the earlier titles in the series will likely be very comfortable with the combat system.****It should be noted that this is actually the western conversion of Shining Force III: Episode I, and was therefore only the first episode in an intended series of three. Unfortunately the other two titles were never released outside of Japan, so most western gamers were only able to experience a third of the storyline."
Shining the Holy Ark (USA)>Shining the Holy Ark>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Camelot Software Planning>Role-Playing>4.0>1 Player>"Part of the Shining game universe, ""Shining the Holy Ark"" is a pure console-style RPG (unlike  Shining Force games, that were strategy/RPG hybrids). You play the role of a young swordsman Arthur, who decided to work as a mercenary for various people needing his services. On his first mission, the King of Enrich sends him to a mine, in order to find and punish a renegade ninja who has escaped from him. However, an accident occurs that makes Arthur realize that he'll have to do much more than his usual mercenary assignment, and that there is a true evil in the world that must be defeated at all costs.****The game features 3D graphics and utilizes first-person perspective for dungeons and battles. The turn-based battles are of a traditional Japanese RPG kind, except the addition of ""Pixie System"". In various places in the game you can find pixies who can later be used as allies in battles."
Shining Wisdom (USA)>Shining Wisdom>1995>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Working Designs>Camelot Software Planning>Role-Playing>4.6>1 Player>Shining Wisdom is the 4th game in the Shining series, but is completely different from the others. Neither a dungeon crawl like Shining in the Darkness, or a tactical battle RPG like Shining Force, the game plays very similarly to Zelda, with its action RPG elements. **The game proceeds by collecting various items found in dungeons and then combining them with magical orbs to create different spell effects that can be used to tackle enemies and solve the riddles that must be bested to beat each labyrinth.
Shinobi Legions (USA)>Shinobi Legions>1995>ESRB - T (Teen)>Vic Tokai, Inc.>Sega>Action>3.5>1 Player>"A ninjitsu master trains three children: two brothers, Kazuma and Sho, and his own daughter Aya. As they grow up, the oldest boy, Kazuma, becomes obsessed with power and demands to learn the sacred techniques of absolute power. The master refuses, and Kazuma leaves, vowing revenge.****Many years later, long after the master's death, Kazuma returns with an army. He plots his revenge by kidnapping Aya and thus luring Sho into his hideout. As Sho, you must defeat Kazuma and rescue Aya.****Shinobi Legions is a side-scrolling action game, similar to Shinobi III.  Sho's primary weapons are a sword and a finite number of shurikens, both of which are activated with separate buttons. Sho can learn nearly a dozen sword abilities (spinning slash, downward slash, sword shielding, etc.) by collecting powerups scattered throughout levels. There are also ""Fire Dragon"" powerups that act as single use ninja magic attacks that damage all enemies onscreen, which is the only ninja magic available to Sho. The 9 levels range from fighting in the jungle to climbing Mount Fuji, where Sho will encounter mostly enemy ninjas and a few animal enemies (eagles, snakes, etc.). Shinobi Legions is the only Shinobi game for the Saturn and is notable for its use of live-action cutscenes and its use of blood (the first in the series)."
Shockwave Assault (USA)>Shockwave Assault>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Electronic Arts, Inc.>Paradox Development>Simulation>3.5>1 Player>Shockwave Assault combines Shock Wave and its expansion Operation Jumpgate and makes them available for systems other than the 3DO for the first time.****In Shock Wave, the player takes the role of a rookie pilot, defending the Earth from an alien invasion. From the cockpit of the F-177 fighter, one shoots at the alien walkers and fighters with lasers and missiles, rearming and refueling at supply depots when necessary. The story is told with live-action cutscenes.****Operation Jumpgate continues the story with several further missions, set around the solar system.

You can now give names to places, and your city is surrounded by neighboring towns with which you can make trade. Finally, instead of the poll in the first game you now have the option of reading several newspapers to get an idea of your progress."
Skeleton Warriors (USA)>Skeleton Warriors>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Playmates Interactive Entertainment, Inc.>Neversoft Entertainment>Platform>4.4>1 Player>You're Prince Lightstar, with the quest to conquer and slay Baron Dark, who holds the half of a mighty crystal called the Lightstar Crystal. With that crystal he can change anyone with an evil heart into his skeleton slave.****The game is a 2D sidescrolling platform game with 3D pre-rendered graphics, with about 100 types of enemies for you to slay with the weapons you possess. You need to complete 21 levels filled with demonic evil creatures before you can fight the Baron Dark himself, with 3D rendered cutscenes inbetween some levels.
Sky Target (USA)>Sky Target>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Sega>Action>3.5>1 Player>Another 3rd person perspective arcade flight sim by Sega, similar to their classic  After Burner in gameplay but featuring new gameplay mechanics and an entirely polygonal engine.****As in most games of it's type your objective is to clear a number of stages by shooting anything that moves, but at the end of each stage you can select where to go next thanks to branching paths a-la  Darius, which coupled with 4 different planes to select give the game an increased gameplay value.

Solar Eclipse (USA)>Solar Eclipse>1996>ESRB - T (Teen)>Crystal Dynamics, Inc.>Crystal Dynamics>Simulation>3.8>1 Player>Solar Eclipse is a 3D shooter that takes place on and near the many moons of Saturn.  You are a hot-shot pilot with a troubled past.  You've been re-assigned to a new squadron aboard a Tomlinson-class carrier.  There's trouble on a mining colony on the moon Janus.  Your squadron is sent in to investigate, and uncover a lot more than they went looking for.****Solar Eclipse plays kind of like a sequel to Total Eclipse for the 3DO.  Gameplay is pure arcade-style shooter.  You can view the game from a behind-the-ship perspective, or an in-cockpit perspective, but the scrolling is on rails.  You can only travel in one direction.  In each of the 9 missions you will find wave after wave of enemy ships, and a powerful boss ship at the end.****The story in this game is told through a series of full-motion video clips.  In addition to between-level scenes, FMV messages from your squad mates appear from time to time while you play the game.
Sonic 3D Blast (USA)>Sonic 3D Blast>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Traveller's Tales>Platform>3.2>1 Player>While visiting Flicky Island, Sonic notices that the Flickies, his small, feathered friends that can travel between parallel worlds, were captured and turned into badniks (the robot enemies of Sonic) by Dr. Robotnik in his never-ending quest for the Chaos Emeralds. Seven levels separate Sonic from the final showdown with Robotnik.****Sonic 3D was the last Sonic title released for the Mega Drive, the only platforming presence of the blue blur in the Sega Saturn, and one of his rare appearances in Personal Computers. The title, considering the era it was released, is somewhat misleading, as instead of full blown 3D graphics it uses an isometric view where Sonic can move not only forwards and backwards, but also left and right. ****Gameplay is much slower when compared to other games in the series, and the number of badniks is reduced to five in each section. As usual, when Sonic destroys one badnik, an animal leaps free from its insides, but this time Sonic has to pick him up and lead them to an interdimensional ring. While they can be taken one by one, exploring the level with all five allow the player to reach for otherwise inaccessible continue tokens. **Unlike all other previous games, time isn't a requirement: if the player completes a level in more than 10 minutes, it would only mean there would be no time bonus at the end. Finally, to collect all seven Chaos Emeralds, Sonic first must find Tails or Knuckles and offer them at least 50 rings.
Sonic Jam (USA)>Sonic Jam>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Sonic Team>Multiplay>4.3>1-2 Players>A compilation of Sonic's greatest 2D adventures.

Along the way you will also enjoy 3rd person bonus rounds and take on a host of end of level bosses.****Exclusive to the Saturn compilation is the Sonic 3D museum, which allows you to control a 3D animated Sonic through a world full of historical information on the Sonic series, including behind the scenes, details on the characters from each game, artwork and more.

Sonic is not interested at first, but once he notices that Dr. Robotnik will participate he decides to enter. Robotnik is only interested in the race because he's learned the location of the Chaos Emeralds and now he'll get a chance to beat Sonic while he gets them. Knuckles finds out that Sonic will participate, so he joins him. Amy overhears Robotnik's plan, so she will also be racing to get the Chaos Emeralds.****There are many modes of gameplay in Sonic R:****Grand Prix: You race against the rest of the characters on each of the circuits, and get a chance to race the level's boss to unlock some of the extra playable characters.****Time Attack: Run on one of the tracks as fast as you can, get 5 balloons or tag 4 characters.****Multi Player: 4 players on a split-screen or over a network. You can race against up to three players or challenge them on a balloon finding game. The screen can be divided horizontally or vertically for 2 player games.
Soviet Strike (USA)>Soviet Strike>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>Electronic Arts, Inc.>EA Tiburon>Action>3.5>1 Player>"In 1991, the U.S.S.R. (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) boasting the largest military force in history, suddenly and unexpectedly collapsed. Since that time the fallen empire has lain lifeless -- a rich corpse waiting to be picked clean. Now, a sinister ex-KGB general codenamed Shadowman directs a flock of vultures to swoop in from all parts of Eastern Europe and claim Russia's nuclear warheads and weapons of mass terror. While directing these 'wars of liberation' Shadowman intends to shake democratic Russia to it's foundations, bringing about a return to the Cold War...or even worse. You chopper into Crimea and discover the plot of this Russian madman using thermal spy devices. You must quickly move on to the Black Sea to prevent the hijacking of ICBM ships, respond to an attack on a chemical weapons plant in the desert passes, and then recover a nuclear reactor core in Transylvania. As you successfully thwart these stages of Operation Vulture, Shadowman is forced to take his coup to the streets of Moscow. Guide your chopper through five unique 3D worlds as you complete 41 deadly missions. Enemy vehicles, tactics, and responses change, based upon your activities, making this the first of STRIKE's new ""Living Battlefields""."
Space Hulk - Vengeance of the Blood Angels (USA)>Space Hulk - Vengeance of the Blood Angels>1996>ESRB - T (Teen)>Electronic Arts, Inc.>Krisalis Software>Shooter>3.8>1 Player>Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels is a mix of a First-Person-Shooter and a tactical fighting game. It is placed in the**Warhammer 40k background of the Games Workshop table top games. **It is the successor of the PC game Space Hulk from 1993 and it tells of the fight between the imperial Terminator Chapters and the Tyranid Gene Stealers.****You control up to ten Terminators. You give them orders in a tactical screen and/or take over one of them and then move in a 3D environment and fight the Gene Stealers just as in a First- Person-Shooter. So the game includes tactical planning and fighting in a good balance.
Space Invaders (Japan)>Space Invaders>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Taito Corporation>Taito Corporation>Shoot->2.8>1-2 Players>This version of Space Invaders is based on the 1994 arcade game Space Invaders DX but lacks the parody mode of that game. What remains is the classic mode that allows the player to choose the type of arcade cabinet (upright, black & white, etc.) as background to the action as well as the versus mode for two players. The versus mode is split-screen, each player trying to survive and eliminate more invaders than the opponent.
Space Jam (USA)>Space Jam>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.>Sculptured Software>Sports/Basketball>4.1>1-6 Players>Based on the movie of the same name, Space Jam centres around an invasion of Looney Tunes land by tiny aliens. The fate of the Tunes is to be decided by a basketball game, and for this the aliens turn into the huge, evil Monstars.****The game is about two thirds basketball sim and then minigames are stuck in to fill all the gaps. You can play as the Monstars or the Looney Tunes who have the help of Michael Jordan. The basketball games themselves come in two flavours, two-on-two and three-on-three.****Successful completion of the minigames upgrades your character's abilities on the court. There are several - one involves finding MJ's basketball togs, one is a space race in the style of the retro Micro Machines games. There are about five minigames in all, and a player from both teams participates.****The multiplayer is a big aspect of the game. There is the traditional two-player versus, one team Tunes, one team Monstars, and there is also co-operative mode. In this two or even three players can play on the same team. Using multitaps, you can actually have a three-on-three game.****The Tunes roster is made up of Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola Bunny, Taz, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepé Le Pew, Sylvester, Wile E. Coyote, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam. The Monstars have access to Pound, Bupkus, Bang, Blanko and Nawt.****There are three statistics in the game, namely Speed, Shooting and Rebounds. These are pretty self-explanatory, but there is another more subtle one that's similar to stamina. Throughout the course of play your characters will get tired and lose their focus. A successful slam dunk usually tops this up.****The closest thing the game has to a single player mode is the Intergalactic Tournament (though it can be played multiplayer). This is a series of five matches in a row. One captain is picked and plays every game, while the rest of the team is substituted in and out.****There is no real way to progress in the game as it does not support memory cards.

Spot Goes to Hollywood (USA)>Spot Goes to Hollywood>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Inc.>Burst Studios>Platform>3.8>1 Player>The central character in this game is Spot, the little red guy from the 7-Up TV commercials.  Spot has somehow become trapped in a movie projector.  As he jumps from film to film, he encounters many classic film genres that make up all the different levels of the game.  The main levels are a pirate movie, an adventure movie, and a horror movie, but there are many other bonus films to unlock.****The game is played from an isometric perspective.  As you control spot, you have to collect 5 Hollywood stars per level to unlock hidden areas and ultimately complete the game 100%.
Star Fighter (USA)>Star Fighter>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.>Krisalis Software>Shooter>3.4>1 Player>"3037. FedNet is now in control of the federation, and at an attempt to gain trust of the population following decades of corruption and warfare, the FedNet Space Corps were sent to the outermost planets to crush the small-time warlords still running the show there. After being ""convinced"" to join them in a tour of duty, he is assigned to an elite flight group with the only purpose of testing the most cutting edge technology.****A remake of the original game of the same title released a few years before for the Acorn Archimedes platform, Starfighter 3000 features more detailed graphics (now all surfaces are texture-mapped and a fogging filter reduces clipping). Featuring 15 levels in 4 worlds, the player controls the Predator Mark-IV, a fighter ship capable of space and atmospheric flight. However, other than the handy boost button, the player has no control over the throttle, and must keep moving at all times. Two points of view are available: behind (better for acrobatics and general flying) and cockpit (accurate aiming and NOE flight). By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet.**One of the defining features of the game is using the laser (basic weapon) to terraform the map. As the game map is composed by tiles, some with higher or lower vertexes, can be leveled by simply firing repeatedly at the same area. This allows players to strategically avoid heavy defense turrets by simply collapsing a hill, or destroy an heavier turret by simply burrowing the ground beneath it.****The player starts the game with three lives, and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game over, but as there isn't a profile for each pilot (like in Tie Fighter), the game can be resumed freely from the last savegame."

WarCraft II - The Dark Saga (USA)>WarCraft II - The Dark Saga>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>Electronic Arts, Inc.>Blizzard Entertainment>Strategy>3.6>1 Player>Electronic Arts brings Blizzard's best-selling strategy game to the PlayStation and Saturn in this release.  They've combined all the missions from Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness and its expansion pack, Beyond the Dark Portal, into one package.  ****You take charge of either the humans and elves or the orcish hordes for control of the lands of Azeroth.  Eventually you work through the dark portal and into the orcs homeland.  You take charge of either side as you work through more than 20 missions per side in the fight for survival.****New features for the console release include an auto-build option, where you can set a queue of units to be produced and the ability to select sixteen units at a time instead of the PC's nine.
Whizz (Europe)>Whizz>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Konami Deutschland GmbH>Flair Software Ltd.>Action>3.0>1 Player>Whizz is one of the few 3D platformers to use an isometric viewpoint. The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren’t always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you’d logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy –this reduces the significance of the points system.
Wing Arms (USA)>Wing Arms>1995>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Sega>Flying>3.6>1 Player>Wing Arms is action/shooter starring airplanes mainly from the WW2 era. There is very little simulation here as you shoot your way through levels where usually your mission is to shoot everyone, or to bomb certain targets. Night missions add to the variety. Gameplay is similar to the Wing Commander series, and is intended to be easy to play but hard to master.

Winter Heat (USA)>Winter Heat>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Sega AM3 R&D Division>Sega>Sports/Skiing>3.2>1-4 Players>"Winter Heat is the home conversion of the DecAthlete (also known as Athlete Kings) sequel, replacing decathlon by Winter sports. Competition (in Arcade, Saturn or Practice modes) includes 11 events featuring eight athletes of different nationalities - Li Huang, Karl Vain, Joe Kudou, Ellen Reggiani, Aleksei Rigel and Rick Blade are joined by B.B. (replacing Jef Jansens, who appears as a secret athlete) and Johann Stensen (instead of Femi Kadiena). ****The game is a typical Winter-sports game, in the line of those released by Epyx but with a more arcade feel. The events include:****1. Speed Skiing: A simple dashing event where the goal is to descend the hill as fast as possible (in speeds over 200 km/h). Action is reduced to mash the button to gain speed.****2. Ski Jumping: Composed by four parts: The run up (mash the button to gain speed), the jump (selecting the angle), the flight (mash the button to gain extra length) and the landing (pressing the action button too early will lose valuable meters, too late will cost the jump).****3. Downhill: A simplified version of the real downhill event. It's impossible to miss the gates, and the challenge is to get a strong start-up, keep a straight path not losing speed hitting the fences and hitting the action button to jump hills perfectly.****4. Short Track Speed Skating: A straightforward event where the directional pad controls the direction of the athlete along the speed button to control the pace. As the event runs for over 40 seconds, it's possible to hold second position, making the opponent cut air resistance which allows the player to reach fastest speeds with less button presses.****5. Skeleton: The first event in the ice tunnels, it requires a fast run-up followed by a strong entrance in the tunnels. By pressing the action button it's possible to slow down the sled and make more controlled turns, or the athlete can fall from it, which not only loses time but also requires a small run-up.****6. Slalom: Just like the Downhill, it's impossible to miss a gate in the Slalom. After an initial sprint the player has to press the action button to approach each flag in the best way possible. Hitting the button too early or too late will make the athlete hit the flag, losing valuable time.****7. Aerial: An event similar to the Ski Jump. Instead of offering a ""click-along"" version, the player starts by setting the difficulty of the jump, and then three parts follow: in the run-up, the player sets the speed by mashing the speed button, followed by the jump which sets the strength (by pressing the action button) and when the athlete leaves the launch ramp, the player must mash the speed button once again to complete the jump. To complete a jump, the player must fill each section of the jump bar by making enough button presses****8. Bobsleigh: In all similar to the Skeleton, except there's no option to slow down.****9. Speed Skating: Another simple button-mashing event but with a twist: speed must be controlled on the turns, or the athlete will slip out losing a few seconds in the process. The speed can be controlled by a color graph above the power bar.****10. Snowboard: A mix between the Slalom and Downhill. There are several gates to be passed, plus two jumps. Unlike the other two events, it's possible to miss a gate, which carries a one second penalty for each missed.****11. Cross Country:** The stamina-influenced event. There's a long track with some hills that can be taken for advantage, as during downhill slopes it's possible to gain a lot of speed without losing stamina."

Z (Europe)>Z>1998>ESRB - T (Teen)>GT Interactive Software Europe Ltd.>Prolific>Shooter>3.3>1 Player>"Real-time strategy game with a difference: you fight for control of the sectors, some of which contains manufactories which can gain you additional units. Touch the ""flag"" in the sector and it's yours. Capture the sector before the new unit comes out of the manufactory and the new unit is yours. With six different robots (different armaments and armor and speed), multiple vehicles (from jeeps to tanks) the robots can utilize, your ultimate objective is to destroy the opponent's base... And prevent him from doing the same to you...****Z differs from other RTSs by emphasizing territorial control (and the manufactories) instead of getting kills and gathering a bit army. You have finely balance defense and offense. If you wait too long enemy will grab all the manufactories first. If you go too fast you'll get hammered for stretching yourself too thin. You can hijack enemy vehicles by shooting the driver off. If you send a group of soldiers toward an objective and they find a vehicle, one of them will split off to grab the vehicle. It's these little touches that makes Z an underappreciated title, as you don't really need to micromanage each soldier."
