Head Buster (Japan) (Translated En)>Head Buster>1991>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Masaya>NCS Corporation|Winds Co., Ltd.>Strategy>2.9>1-2 Players>Head Buster is a so-called ”future sports” game about robots. On a top-down, horizontally scrolling playfield, armed robots are moved around in a manner similar to Super Robot Taisen strategy games, albeit without many of the refinements of that series.****Each game starts at the shop, where robots on your team are bought and equipped according to your tastes and finances. After that, the game begins in the robot arena, blue team against red team in one corner each. The goal is not explicitly to destroy the robots of the opposing team, but to destroy their base. In order to reach their base, and to prevent them from reaching yours, a certain amount of fighting is required. Each turn is split into a movement phase and a combat phase, and since actions of both sides are only executed when a phase is over, you cannot know when moving how close you will get to your opponents.****Robots are available in three basic classes, from light to heavy, but can be modified with new movement units (different terrain squares have different movement properties), better armour and new weapons. Different weapons have both different strength and different ranges, as well as a limited supply of bullets. Reloading is done during the combat phase, but requires that your robot stays out of combat during that turn. Different sensors and command units can also be added, giving the robots better aim or particular abilities such as dodging, shielding and healing.

Contact with each of these loses you a limb, and once you have none left, contact means game over.

However, it does not feature digitized contestants, studio or the host Alex Trebek, though it does feature a photo likeness of him for intros.  Instead it features a more cartoonish look without sports-themed contestants and less questions than the console versions.  It does feature a two-player option utilizing the link cable allowing friends to compete head-to-head, but only allows the player to compete against one computer opponent as opposed to two as in other versions.

Compared to the Genesis version released a year earlier, the Game Gear version features only about half the number of questions, and replaces the console version's photo-realistic style with a more cartoon-like approach. Unlike in the actual TV show, there always only two contestants. Players can choose their avatar from six different characters. The game supports one or two players: in a two-player game, both share the same Game Gear and must buzz in by using either the d-pad or the face buttons. Once buzzed in, the question must be spelled out within 60 seconds, with the game allowing for some spelling variations and minor misspellings. Game rules are accurate to the original show and include Daily Doubles and the Double Jeopardy and Final Jeopardy rounds. The game features a cartoon representation and digitized speech samples of TV host Alex Trebek (plus a digitized picture on boot-up) and a rendition of the original theme music.

He was voted by the Associated Press as the most valuable player two years running (1989-90).  In Joe Montana Football the player can play a game of American Football with Joe Montana giving the player basic tips on the next best move. The player can play against a friend or play the computer with 3 difficulty levels (beginner, normal, and professional) in a full game (5 min per quarter) using all the real rules and scoring. The teams are made up of 28 American city names with no team names (or player names) mentioned. Once the coin is flipped and the kick-off the game begins.  The player controls the on-screen player as they try to run up the field. Once the player is downed the game turns to a play selection screen where the player can choose their next play (tactic) out of the 17 different preset plays available, as well as a punt, attempt at a field goal, or a turnover, all done in full view of the opponent (the CPU will change their play to match yours). More often then not Joe himself will give a tip on the best play that it will default to. On the field the player controlling the quarterback can throw it to the receiver (changing the player control to the receiver), change the receiver to pass to, or try to run with the quarterback. When play changes hands and the player becomes a defender the player has 6 defensive plays to choose from as well as a turnover. On the field the player controls a single player chosen by cycling though the players or selecting the player closest to the selected receiver. Two player mode works the same as single player but with a player instead of the computer.

This makes putting the pieces together to form the overall picture both more interesting and more difficult, since the player can not analyse each piece at his own pace when the entire puzzle is moving about. Pieces also need to be flipped around both on the X and Y axis in order to fit together.****The game has 7 puzzles, some of which are carried over from the earlier versions but mostly new ones designed with Sega characters. Due to the small screen, the pieces are not kept in a box at the bottom of the screen as in the original Kinetic; instead they are all placed out on the grid already, in a random order. Each puzzle can be played in three different modes:****Mode 1 lets the player swap pieces around as he likes. Mode 2 lacks one piece and lets the player slide pieces around as in a sliding puzzle.

Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones from the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players.  The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any combination of skills and experiment. Unlike the first game, the player is rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and Bronze are also on offer. The player can also go back over levels in the hope of saving more Lems.  Because there are 12 tribes, and the player can switch between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress. The game saves progress rather than using passwords as in the first game.

You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your &quot;roar meter&quot; to charge. ****As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you're skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen). ****The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.
Lost World, The - Jurassic Park (USA)>Lost World, The - Jurassic Park>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Aspect Co., Ltd.>Action>4>1 Player>"The Game Gear received a unique adaptation of the 1997 dinosaur sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park. It is primarily a side-scrolling platform game but also includes some other gameplay elements. Players control a hunter who, armed with a stun rifle and having enlisted the the help of a friendly Procompsognathus (""Compy""), must make his way through various levels on Isla Sorna to finally reach a helicopter and escape. The next level to be played can be chosen on an overview map of the island, allowing for some freedom regarding level order. In the standard platform levels, the goal is simply to reach the exit. Various dinosaurs must be avoided or taken out with the gun and environmental dangers like sand pits, rock avalanches and water holes must also be mastered. The gun's ammunition is unlimited and the hunter can take several hits before losing a life - his health is indicated by the color of his shirt. Replacement body armor is available as a power-up. In one of the levels, players don't control the hunter but Compy instead. Compy can only take one hit before losing a life, and instead of a gun, he has a jump attack. He also has the ability to climb walls. After most platform levels, a boss fight against an especially large and/or dangerous dinosaur follows, each attacking in a certain pattern requiring its own strategy to defeat. Variety from the standard platforming comes in a level where a raging Triceratops attacks from the left and the hunter must run for his life through the automatically-scrolling landscape. The final escape from the island takes place in a car, seen from the front (i.e. driving towards the screen), with a T. Rex attacking from behind. Both the dinosaur's attacks as well as obstacles on the road (like boulders and water puddles) must be avoided to reach the goal."

It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.****These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.****Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.****The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

Ninja Gaiden (USA, Europe)>Ninja Gaiden>1991>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Tecmo, Ltd.>Platform>4>1 Player>Ninja Gaiden begins with a cinematic animation in which 2 ninjas duel to the death; one goes down. It is revealed that the doomed ninja is the father of Ryu Hayabusa. When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu's father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world.****Ninja Gaiden is a side scrolling game where Ryu the ninja can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats.****Ryu will battle through urban city settings, forests, jungles, snow covered castles, underground railroads, and ancient castles. A major feature in Ninja Gaiden are the cinematic scenes -- sometimes fullscreen -- through which the storyline unfolds.
Olympic Gold (USA)>Olympic Gold>1992>ESRB - E (Everyone)>U.S. Gold Ltd.>Tiertex Ltd.>Sports/Olympic>1.9>1-4 Players>The official game of the Games of the XXV Olympiad, held in Barcelona in 1992, featuring seven different events: 100M Sprint, Hammer Throw, Archery, 110M Hurdles, Pole Vault, Springboard diving and 200M Freestyle Swimming.****Gameplay features the typical button mashing formula used by Epyx during the 80s. 100M Sprint, 110M Hurdles and 200M Freestyle Swimming feature a button mashing sequence with just some changes: in the hurdles the player must hit the action key to jump over a hurdle (the timing sets the loss of speed) and in swimming, the sequence takes over one and an half minutes and the action button touches the edge for the return swim. In these events, the player initially faces a semi-final round and only qualifies for the final if ends in the top half. It's possible to watch the other semi-final.**Hammer Throw combines a strong mashing sequence, along an accurate press of the action button to release the hammer, while Pole Vault combines an initial mashing sequence, a first tap on down to set the bar, then pressing up and the action button to release the pole and jump over the bar. Archery is a technical event where the player has three rounds with six arrows each, the winner being the one with the highest score on all three rounds.****The player can choose to compete for eight nations: Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, hosts Spain, United Stats, Japan and the CIS (formerly the Soviet Union). Each nation has it's own sample of the anthem and a set of athletes to compete against the player. Each athlete is unique, and will perform differently according the the event: in some they are capable of braking World Records, in others, lucky enough to get to a final or a top-6 spot. The competition is split in two tables: sorted by medals and by total score (the gold medalist gets 24 points, the 12th only 13).
Ottifants, The (Europe)>Ottifants, The>1993>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Graftgold Ltd.>Platform>4.5>1 Player>Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It's an ordinary evening, and Bruno's dad is working late at office. Reason enough for Bruno's vivid imagination to run riot, thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it's up to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle - workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen through kids' eyes - and rescue his dad!****The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Bruno through five worlds: starting with the house and the basement, through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle, whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno's primary weapon is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's special skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and more. ****Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and raises Bruno's score up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But, unlike the Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point reward by completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing your journey through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies. The varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.

Your Ferrari is at the ready, complete with female passenger, over a series of short tracks.****Gameplay is viewed form just above and behind the car, so you can see it. The roads are full of sharp bends and hazards, contact with which can cause the car to roll and lose you time. On each section of track there is a fork in the road, allowing you to choose which direction you go in. You have to complete 5 track sections in total, out of the 15 in the game.
OutRun Europa (USA, Europe)>Out Run Europa>1991>ESRB - E (Everyone)>U.S. Gold Ltd.>Probe Software Ltd.>Driving>3.8>1 Player>The third game in the OutRun series, which revolutionised the third-person perspective style of racing games. The levels are set across Europe, as you bid to escape from the police. Unlike in the predecessors, you use a different vehicle on each level, with motorbikes and jet-skis adding variety and taking different skill to use. You must complete each level within the strict time limits, and the roads are dogged with other cars to avoid and overtake. You can choose between sound effects or music.
Pac-Attack (USA, Europe)>Pac-Attack>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Namco Hometek Inc.>Namco Limited>Puzzle>3.2>1-2 Players>"Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.****The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a ""wall"" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.****Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.****The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.****All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode."
Pac-In-Time (USA) (Proto)>Pac-In-Time>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Namco Limited>Kalisto>Platform>3>1 Player>Everybody knows what/who Pac-Man is from his heyday in the '80s, but this time, we're getting a whole new adventure of our little eater. Guess his stomach is full, 'cause there's nothing much to eat here, only collecting points. This is much like some Indiana Jones adventure, only your little hero's Pac-Man instead of Harrison Ford. Pac-in-time is the US release of Fury of the Furries. It's exactly the same game. Only the characters were changed: the not-so-known European Tinies (from the Skweek/Super Skweek/Tiny Skweeks/Brainies/Tinies games) were replaced by the widely known Pac-Man.
Pac-Man (USA)>Pac-Man>1991>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Namco Limited>Namco Limited>Action>3.4>1-2 Players>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.****Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.****Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.****Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.
Panzer Dragoon Mini (Japan)>Panzer Dragoon Mini>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Shooter>3>1 Player>Panzer Dragoon Mini is the Japan-only 8-bit version of Sega's popular 32-bit rail shooter, but due to (massive) hardware limitations, the game has more in common with other classic Sega game, Space Harrier. Taking further away from the original games, there is no rider and the game lacks any plotline.**The player starts by choosing one of three dragons, and from there must shoot at incoming enemies (although for most time, just avoiding incoming fire is an easier way to progress in the game). At the end of the level (each with two bosses), a password appears and allows the game to be resumed later.

A tutorial mode is provided to help you get used to the forehand, lob and drop shots on offer. Several venues from all over the world can be played on, on Hard, Grass and Clay courts.****This was the first and one of the very few Genesis games to be released with a J-Cart, which meant that four-way gameplay was possible without the need of special adapters – the cartridge had two built-in joypad connectors. The Game Gear version was equally inventive, allowing two players to share one Game Gear, or four players to play doubles by linking two machines.

PGA Tour Golf (USA)>PGA Tour Golf>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Tengen Inc.>Sterling Silver Software>Golf/Sports>2.2>1-4 Players>PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions commonly seen in the genre since. The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing. ****Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.****When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear with tactical advice for each hole.

Players can choose to either play in Tournament mode, Skins Play or learn the basics of the game in Practice mode.  ****Players use a cursor on a top-down view of a map to determine the location as well as another view from behind the golfer to avoid various obstacles such as trees.  After selecting their location they can then use a meter to the bottom left to determine how much draw or fade will be put into the shot.  To hit the ball, the players presses the ""B"" button to start the power meter and hitting it again to stop.****Players must also adjust to changing wind and weather conditions during game play which will drastically change the outcome of their shot.

Pop Breaker (Japan)>Pop Breaker>1991>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Micro Cabin Corp.>Micro Cabin Corp.>Shooter>3.5>1-2 Players>Pop Breaker is a puzzle game with action elements. The goal of each level is to destroy certain things. The basic way to do this is to shoot them, but there are various obstacles which need to be circumvented, e.g. mirrors which reflect shots; the direction is indicated by small arrows on the floor. Destructible blocks are distinguished by their colour, for example a purple block becomes blue when shot once and vaporizes after the next. Enemies are also capable of destroying blocks. Reflected own and enemy shots (along with mines on the floor) can kill the space ship, but extra lives can be earned by collecting power ups. One speciality is that the player can change the position of the gun; either left, right or central.

Before starting out, you're given the choice between all the secondary weapons, with suggestive names such as Hammer Hawk or Rising Masher. These are upgraded in the same vein as in GG Aleste until you reach a frightening potential, covering the screen in bullets and napalm explosions. As a last resort, you're also given the ultimate weapon; a smart bomb destroying all enemies on-screen. Unfortunately, you're only given one bomb per life. As far as the weapons arsenal goes, this is the pinnacle in 8-bit Aleste versions. The graphics have been revised with a clearer look which turns out better on the Game Gear's fuzzy screen.**Perhaps taking a cue from the Sonic games of the time, the bonus levels are in 3-D, giving you the chance to earn bonus points and extra lives by shooting down as many baddies as possible in Galaxy Force style.

In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels.

You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever. There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire.

While Sonic & Tails are out searching for them, Robotnik finds the yellow emerald and convinces Knuckles the Echidna that Sonic wants to steal all the other Emeralds. While all this is happening, Nack the Weasel seizes his chance to take the emeralds for himself while everyone else is pre-occupied. Now it's a 4-way race to retrieve the emeralds.****The gameplay is like the other Sonic titles, but this is only available on the Game Gear. The player can choose to play as Sonic or Tails (who can fly), and you're trying to reach the Chaos Emeralds before anyone else.

Most of the zones are based on those in the original game, but some are entirely new. Enemies (mechanized animals, defeated by Sonic's spikes when jumping or rolling) and power-ups (speed-ups, shields, extra lives) are mostly the same as well. Sonic can pick up golden rings for protection (when hit, he simply loses all of his rings instead of a life) and bonuses: 100 rings gain Sonic an extra life, and 50 remaining rings at the end of a level allow access to pinball-themed special stages full of bumpers and springs. The final level of a zone is always a boss fight against Robotnik.****Sonic should also collect the six Chaos Emeralds to keep them from falling into Robotnik's hands. In a departure from the original game, these are not hidden in the special stages but somewhere in the regular levels.

Another mode has you navigating the ship to its destination by flying through rectangles in space.****On away missions, the view switches to a top-down perspective where you control a single character and can fire your phaser at enemies.****Finally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the first one, frequencies must be decoded: this is done by putting symbols into the right order. One can only guess the order at first, but after an attempt the game reveals how many of the selected symbols are part of the combination and how many are in the right place. Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a limited number of tries.****The second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To do so, a path must be built on a grid for the energy to flow through. The path must be built out of randomly assigned pieces that don't always fit together, similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.

Mismatched tiles simply build stacks higher and higher, and the player loses if the tiles reach the top of the gate. The player is also given a seven-symbol Stargate ""address"" along the top of the screen. Stacking three copies of a symbol listed in the address will clear the stack and counts toward completing the address.****There are two game modes building on this basic concept:****1. Skill Mode is a single-player challenge where the player tries to complete as many addresses as they can before being overwhelmed. Speed increases with completed addresses.****Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or against a second player connected with a link cable. In Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are sent through the Stargate and appear on your opponent's side. A height level meter is added on the sides to show how close you and your opponent are to overflowing their gates. You can win by outlasting your opponent (while sending complete stacks through to make things more difficult for them) or by being the first to complete the address."

T2 - The Arcade Game (USA, Europe)>T2 - The Arcade Game>1993>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.>Midway>Shooter>3>1 Player>As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. ****Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.****T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.****Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).
Tails Adventures (World)>Tails Adventures>1995>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Aspect Co. Ltd.>Platform>3.7>1 Player>Before Tails met Sonic the Hedgehog he lived on Cocoa Island, a place that isn't on the map. It's an island pulled up by the Chaos Emeralds. Suddenly, while relaxing, Tails hears an explosion that seems like it's coming from inside the island. A Flicky tells Tails that Battle Kukku has invaded the island. He also tells Tails that Battle Kukku is mining here for the Chaos Emeralds, to obtain it's power. Tails gears up and heads for his quest to find the machine parts to build his weapon to defeat the evil Battle Kukku. There are however major plot differences between the Japanese and the western release. In the US and European version of the game it tells the story how Sonic and Tails decide to go separate ways for a while. Tails finds an unknown island and decides to dub it Tails Island. While resting there, a large explosion occurs and a Flicky tells him birds are invading the island.****Unlike the other games in the series, this spin-off is less of a traditional platformer, but has a much slower pace with rpg elements and a focus on puzzle-solving. Tails can walk, jump, fly (momentarily), hang on ledges and throw bombs. He starts with ten health points that can be replenished with rings, but the amount can be extended to 99 by collecting chaos emeralds. In the twelve stages Tails can collect up to 26 items. Per level however, he is only allowed to bring along four and this adds a tactical dimension. One of the most vital tools is the Remote Robot that can squeeze through small areas that Tails cannot reach. Underwater he changes into the small submarine Sea Fox.

The passing silver cart is driven by a woman who says she is Wendy Witchcart. She proclaims that everything on the island is hers and threatens to transform everyone in crystal who does not follow her rules. Tails, determined to save all the animals on the island, sets in a chase to the Witchcart.****Gameplay is fairly similar to the Sonic series. Tails need to defeat enemies and complete obstacles. He can fly, but is constantly suspended. He carries a golden rind that is used to take out enemies or to latch on to devices. Sonic, the emeralds and Dr. Robotnik are not presented, and neither are there rings to collect during the levels.****The game came to other territories as an unlockable minigame in the GameCube version of Sonic Adventure DX and as one of the titles in the Sonic Gems Collection.

There are five game modes (friendly, penalty shootout, tournament, playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one of them must be completed in one sitting.****The gameplay can be tweaked for the players' preference by changing several key aspects of the physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight (lighter balls travel higher, faster  and farther but are more prone to be deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game allows a lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection.****Graphically, the game is similar to EA's Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D effects allowing the view to be tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted down to show more of the field. ****The series later continued with Striker on the same console and Striker' 96 on PC, Saturn and PlayStation.

Each character has a unique ability vital to some stages such as Storm's and Rogue's ability to fly while Cyclops and Gambit has long range capabilities and Wolverine's raw power.****The story starts off with the world in peril as a deadly virus called the Legacy Virus is spreading throughout the world and is threatening to extinguish all of mankind.  The X-Men learn of a cure that has been developed by a scientist by the name of the Gamesmaster and ask for his help, but in order to obtain the antidote they must first compete in a series of games scattered throughout the world by beating up various enemies and avoiding pitfalls and traps.  To make matters worse, Gamesmaster has promised the X-Men's arch-rivals that if they can stop the X-Men from completing their tasks that they can have the antidote and destroy the only hope for mankind.****The gameplay is a 2D side-scrolling beat-em-up with eight stages total that range from the Arctic to Egypt and the Moon with the ability for the player to choose the location they wish to explore first at the beginning of the game.

X-Men (USA)>X-Men>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Platform>2.1>1 Player>"X-Men is a sidescrolling beat'em up/platform game, much like its homonymous Mega Drive/ Genesis counterpart. Several X-Men characters are playable throughout the game. The player can choose from two characters from the start, Cyclops and Wolverine, and three Levels are accessible. In the course of the game, the player can unlock five other X-Men, namely Storm, Iceman, Rogue, Nightcrawler and Psylocke.****The story is that most of the X-Men have been kidnapped by Magneto, which is the reason why only Cyclops and Wolverine are available from the start. Apparently, unlocking the characters equals rescuing him. On the way, there several foes from the X-Men universe to beat, and at the end, Magneto once again needs a reprehension.****The basic mechanics of the game are punching, (double-)jumping and jump-kicking. Furthermore, pressing Start activates/ deactivates the characters mutant ability, for example Wolverine's claws or Cyclops' laser beams. Using it however drains a limited amount of energy, which can be refreshed by finding ""X""-symbols."
Yogi Bear in Yogi Bear's Goldrush (USA) (Proto)>Yogi Bear in Yogi Bear's Goldrush>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Gametek>Empire Software>Platform>3.3>1 Player>"Jellystone National Park is in trouble and it is up to Yogi Bear to save the day. The money needed to keep the park up and running for the winter has been stolen by an evil ghost named Jake, determined to shut down the park, and hidden by him in twelve safes somewhere in the park. The player must travel to six different locations to locate these safes (a forest, a pirate ship, the big city, an underground cavern, the old west and a final showdown with Jake).The gameplay is fairly simple: using Yogi, the player can travel from left to right and right to left on the screen; to kill certain enemies the hero must jump on them. Some enemies, however, can't be killed and must be avoided since Yogi has no weapons to harm them; he has to avoid various pitfalls and hazards as well.There are no true power-ups; instead, there are picnic baskets scattered throughout the stage, a 100 of which will grant the player an extra life. Likewise, there are icons labeled ""1-UP"" that will give the player a life, as well as health-refilling items. There are also hidden doors and areas that the player must find in order to locate the various safes. When Yogi enters these safes, he must collect the 25 gold coins to get a bar of gold; collecting 12 of these gold bars will give Yogi the money needed to win the game."

His task is to investigate various cases involving ghosts and demons in the human world.****The game is a classic side-scrolling beat'em up and offers several characters from the manga to play. Apart from, as expected, Yusuke the player can choose between Hiei, Kuwabara and Kurama. All characters have different values in five attributes like jumping or speed. The game offers some variations from the standard beta'em up formula: There are four different levels accessible from the beginning and can be played through in any order. However, after completing level, the player has to choose a new character he hasn't used yet for the next stage. If a character looses all his health, he has to fill it up with the health of the other characters and thus weakening them for the later levels. The game also switches to different mode for the boss fights. By turns, the player has to dodge an attack from the boss and then do a attack on his own by pressing Punch at the time when a moving cross-hair is over the boss."
Yu Yu Hakusho 2 - Gekitou! Nanakyou no Tatakai (Japan) (Translated En)>Yu Yu Hakusho 2 - Gekitou! Nanakyou no Tatakai>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Minato Giken>Action>3.2>1-2 Players>"Yu Yu Hakusho II: Gekito! Shichi Kyo no Tatakai is based on the the manga / anime series Yu Yu Hakusho, which is about the teenage delinquent Yusuke Urameshi, who is appointed as an ""Underworld Detective"" after being killed in a car accident while trying to save a child's life. His task is to investigate various cases involving ghosts and demons in the human world. While the first game was a side-scrolling beat 'em up featuring four characters from the manga, the second game is a one-on-one fighting game. The game though does take a different approach than games like Street Fighter, as you do not control the movement of your character, as both opponents stand still. You fight by pressing a combination of buttons to make your character perform a certain attack. The efficiency of the attack depends on two factors: The position of a moving cross-hair on the body of your opponent, which determines the spot you attack, and the amount of energy in a displayed ""move gauge"" which increases over the time. To perform a special attack, you also need a certain amount of Ki energy which is displayed in another gauge. The Ki regenerates while it's not used further, and without Ki a player is limited to only normal attacks. The triggered attacks are then displayed in an anime style animation sequence showing both opponents doing their corresponding move. In single player mode (a two-player mode is available via linking two Game Gears), one may either play a tournament or single fight against a character of one' choice. However, not all fighters are accessible from the beginning (the single combat mode also starts with one character less than the tournament mode) and must be unlocked by progressing in the game (progress is saved with passwords). Altogether, there are seven characters to choose from: Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei, Itsuki, Toguro and Sensui Shinobu."
