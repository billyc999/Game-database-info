Air Cars (World)>Air Cars>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>ICD>MidNite Entertainment Group Inc.>Driving>1.9>1-8 Players>AirCars takes place in the future after a nuclear holocaust. **The large organization E.B.N.E.R.S. is plotting to take over the world and has developed advanced forcefield and teleportation systems, and nuclear powered AirCars. To stop the plot, your group steals plans, builds its own AirCar, and sets out to destroy all of the bases, 28 known and countless unknown ones, stationed around the globe.****You can choose to play a single player game, the 2-player game using a JagLink, or up to 8 players using ICD's CatBoxes. On screen and on radar, each player's AirCar is displayed in a different color to help identify the good guys from the bad guys. There are 3 difficulty settings. You will be using the cockpit's instrument panel to fly the AirCar, select weapons and view radar, as well as combating the enemy in the air and shooting ground targets.****Features include true 3D sound, a computer voice (which can be turned off if desired), and music during the introduction and level intermissions.
Alien vs Predator (World)>Alien vs Predator>1994>ESRB - K-A (Kids to Adults)>Atari Games>Rebellion Developments Ltd.>Shooter>4.0>1 Player>The Jaguar version of Alien vs. Predator is completely different from the Arcade and SNES games of the same name.****The Jaguar version takes place entirely on a Colonial Marine Training base.  A ship infested with Aliens is found floating near the outer-space training facility.  Of course, once the Aliens get inside the base, they kill off nearly everyone.  Meanwhile, the Predators dock their ship on the training base as well.  They see this as an opportunity to catch an Alien Queen, and bring honor to their clan.****So there are three scenarios in which to play:  First, you can play as a Marine. Your job is to find a way to self-destruct the base, and make your way to an escape pod before it blows.  The second scenario allows you to play as an Alien.  Here, your job is to find and protect the Queen from the Marines and the Predators.  Finally, you can play as the Predator.  The Predator must simply find and kill the Alien Queen.****The game plays like a first person shooter.  The play field consists of the 5 levels of the training base, plus areas for the Predator and Alien ships.  All the areas of the ship are inter-connected, giving the game a huge virtual environment.  Depending on the scenario you choose, you will have to choose different strategies based on the capabilities of your character.  For example, the Marine will have to make use of his weapons and his ability to use the ship's computer terminals.  The Aliens, on the other hand, will have to make use of their great numbers and ability to cocoon their enemies.  And finally the Predator must fight with honor, and not over-use his invisibility capability.
Atari Karts (World)>Atari Karts>1995>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Atari Games>Miracle Designs>Driving>3.2>1-2 Players>"Atari Karts is a character-based go-kart racing game. It plays very similarly to Super Mario Kart. The emphasis in this game, like most kart games, is on making use of pick-up items found around the track to knock out your opponents.****There is only one game mode, a points based cup series.  There are four difficulty levels, each with 3 cups to race for. After completing all the cups for a difficulty level, you get to challenge a ""boss"" kart in a single race match.  If you beat the boss, he becomes a playable character.  The various cup races can be played in either single player or two player split screen modes."

Battle Sphere Gold (World)>Battle Sphere Gold>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>ScatoLogic>ScatoLogic>Flying>2.8>1-8 Players>A 3D space combat simulator, BattleSphere's story was based upon an episode in the original Star Trek television series and it plays similarly to Star Raiders.****Seven alien races vie against each other - the victor will control the galaxy. They meet in an arena in Sector 51, a spherical sector of space formerly used by the Earth government to secretly test new weapons and starships. Gameplay consists of 5 different play modes with different scenarios and goals. Choose from various starships (each with unique weapons systems) and battle the aliens, who have also chosen their best fighters and have many space ships of their own.
Brutal Sports Football (World)>Brutal Sports Football>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Atari Games>Teque London Ltd.>Football/Sports>3.2>1-2 Players>Similar to Speedball 2 in many ways, this is an ultra-violent sports game. Matches last 7 minutes, and the aim is to get the ball into a goal at each end, guarded by a net-minder. The ball can be thrown or kicked, and is an oval, resulting in frequent up-and-under type kicks. ****The gameplay is fast and flowing, and has one rule - if you can't get the ball, get the man, and decapitate him if possible. Bonus and non-bonus items appear on the pitch, such as bombs to throw at opponents, rabbits to speed up the current player, or tortoises to slow him down. ****Teams consist of humans and aliens, many of which have their own unique skills. There's a lot of blood and flailing limbs, giving things a gruesomely humorous edge. There are four leagues to progress through, plus a knockout cup and single matches.
Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales (World)>Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Accolade>Imagitec Design Inc.>Platform>3.8>1-2 Players>Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales is the only Bubsy game to appear on the Atari Jaguar.  It's a side scrolling platform game similar to the Genesis and SNES Bubsy series. ****Bubsy is a bobcat superhero who can defeat all enemies by jumping on top of them.  In Fractured Furry Tales, he finds himself in a series of childrens stories.  These aren't the Disney-style happy fairy tales, though.  These are the dark, disturbing Grimm-style fairy tales.  So, Bubsy has to travel through 15 levels and set things right.
Cannon Fodder (World)>Cannon Fodder>1995>ESRB - T (Teen)>Virgin Interactive>Sensible Software>Strategy>4.1>1 Player>Guide a team of up to four soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this innovative top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once). ****Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.
Checkered Flag (World)>Checkered Flag>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Atari Games>Rebellion Developments Ltd.>Driving>2.4>1 Player>Checkered Flag for the Jaguar is a 3D F1-style racing game.

Cybermorph (World) (Rev 2)>Cybermorph>1993>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Atari>Attention to Detail Limited>Shooter>3.4>1 Player>Cybermorph was the first game released for Atari's Jaguar console. It's a 3d sci-fi shoot-'em-up.  The story goes like this:  The evil Pernitia Empire is swallowing up the galaxy's planets left and right.  What's worse, the resistance forces have had their secret weapons stolen from them and put into pods spread out on many different planets.  You must pilot the T-Griffon morphing attack craft to each planet and recover the pods to stop the Pernitians.****So, in each planet, or level, you must collect a certain number of pods and make it to the exit before the enemies shoot you down. Fortunately, there are power-ups that can strategically enhance the T-Griffon's offensive capabilities.  After clearing 8 planets, you take on a boss creature/ship before moving on to the next sector.  There are 4 levels like this to clear, each with progressively increasing difficulty.
Defender 2000 (World)>Defender 2000>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Atari Games>Atari Corporation>Shooter>4.4>1-2 Players>Defender 2000 is an update of the classic arcade game by Eugene Jarvis.  This Jaguar game features a port of the original game, and two updated versions: Defender Plus and Defender 2000.****Defender combines a side scrolling shooter with a search and rescue game. You control a ship that travels left and right above the planets surface. Alien lander craft warp into the play area, and begin to descend to the surface. Along the surface, there are humanoids ripe for the picking.  The alien landers grab the humanoids and begin to carry them up the screen. You have to shoot the landers before they reach the top of the screen, and catch the humanoids before they fall to the surface.****The Defender Plus update features gameplay that is very similar to the original, and graphics that have a crazy, psychedelic look. The Defender 2000 update adds playfields that scroll in both directions, weapon power-ups, bonus rounds, improved graphics, and extremely high speed gameplay.
Doom (World)>Doom>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Atari Games>id Software, Inc.>Shooter>4.4>1-2 Players>The Union Aerospace Corporation has been experimenting with teleportation technology on Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos. After early successes, something goes wrong. It seems the scientists have opened a gateway straight to Hell. Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and the whole of Deimos simply vanishes. A squad of marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are quickly slaughtered. It falls to the surviving marine to grab some guns and strike back at the demons.****id Software's follow-up to their genre-defining Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM is another first person shooter: full-on action seen from the space marine's perspective. Like Wolfenstein, the game consists of distinct episodes, playable in any order. The first episode, Knee-Deep in the Dead, takes place in the Phobos base and is freely available as shareware. The full game continues on Deimos in The Shores of Hell and culminates in Inferno, the final episode which takes place in Hell itself. Each episode consists of nine levels, one of which is a hidden level.****The basic objective in each level is simply to reach the exit. Since dozens of enemies stand in the way, the only way to get there is through killing them. Switches and buttons must be **pressed to advance at certain points and often color-coded locked doors will block the way - matching keycards or skull keys must be found to pass.****DOOM's engine technology is more advanced than Wolfenstein's, and thus the levels are more varied and complex. The engine simulates different heights (stairs and lifts appear frequently) and different lighting conditions (some rooms are pitch black, others only barely illuminated). There are outdoor areas, pools of radioactive waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come down and crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein's orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in DOOM can be in any angle to each other. An automap helps in navigating the levels.****Stylistically, the levels begin with a futuristic theme in the military base on Phobos and gradually change to a hellish environment, complete with satanic symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses and portraits of horned demons), hung-up mutilated corpses and the distorted faces of the damned.****DOOM features a large weapon arsenal, with most weapons having both advantages and drawbacks. The starting weapons are the fists and a simple pistol. Also available are a shotgun (high damage, slow reload, not good at distances), a chaingun (high firing rate, but slightly inaccurate in longer bursts) and a plasma rifle (combining a high firing rate and large damage). The rocket launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the explosion causes blast damage and must be used with care in confined areas or it might prove deadly to the player as well as the enemies. Two further (in)famous weapons in DOOM are the chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the BFG9000 energy gun, that, while taking some practice to fire correctly, can destroy most enemies in a single burst. The different weapons use four different ammunition types (bullets, shells, rockets and energy cells), so collecting the right type for a certain gun is important.****DOOM drops some of Wolfenstein's arcade-inspired aspects, so there are no extra lives or treasures to be collected for points, but many other powerups are still available. Medpacks heal damage while armor protects from receiving it in the first place. Backpacks allow more ammunition to be carried, a computer map reveals the whole layout of the level on the automap (including any secret areas), light amplification visors illuminate dark areas and radiation suits allow travel over waste without taking damage. Also available are berserk packs (which radically increase the damage inflicted by the fists) as well as short-time invisibility and invulnerability powerups.****The enemies to be destroyed include former humans corrupted during the invasion, plus demons in all shapes and sizes: fireball-throwing imps, floating skulls, pink-skinned demons with powerful bite attacks and large one-eyed flying monstrosities called Cacodemons. Each episode ends with a boss battle against one or two especially powerful creatures.****DOOM popularized multiplayer in the genre with two different modes: Cooperative allows up to four players to move through the single-player game together, while Deathmatch is a competitive game type where players blast at each other to collect 'frag' points for a kill and re-spawn in **a random location after being killed.

Fever Pitch Soccer (World) (En,Fr,De,Es,It)>Fever Pitch Soccer>1995>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Atari Games>U.S. Gold Ltd.>Soccer/Sports>3.5>1-2 Players>"In this isometric football game, 50 national teams are represented to play in two game modes: Exhibition and Tournament (a series of seven games on four continents, with a final against the World All-Stars), with the ability to set time, difficulty level, see cutscenes after goals and if players are free to kick each other around without (many) fouls.****While the game seems short-featured for 1995 standards, the tournament mode includes a twist: depending on how well the player defeats his opponents, he can trade his ""standard players"", who won't do anything spectacular (but at least fill up the ranks) for star players, who not only look different, are able to cross and backheel the ball but also have a unique ability at the disposal of the player:****1. The Marker: can latch on an opposing player, stopping him from running away with the ball;****2. Goalkeeper 1: more capable of stopping shots than the regular goalkeeper;****3. Barger: this large, muscular player is able to shove everyone in his path;****4. Tricky: capable of jumping (or bunny-hopping, to be more precise) with the ball tucked between his feet, avoiding tackles;****5. The Cheat: while it's hard to talk about fair play in a game where kicking a defenders' leg to gain a corner is (mostly) a legitimate play, this player takes the whole thing into the next level, being able to dig fouls out of nowhere, at the expense of the ball (if he's carrying it or the referee waves play on) or just some stains in his shirt (if he's trying to pull an offensive foul), with the odds of 50/50 (25% for penalties);****6. Passer: capable of feeding forwards with laser-precision passes; ****7. Striker 1: capable of unleashing impossibly-sliced shots, scoring from virtually any position in the offensive area;****8. Striker 2: best used from positions directly in front of goal, this striker features a shot that is so powerful the ball ignites as it approaches the goal;****9. Goalkeeper 2: features a better chance of stopping special shots from both Strikers;****In Exhibition games teams start with their own setup of start players, from none to a full team. The playing surface also affects gameplay - playing in wet grass removes all ball bounce, the opposite occurring with sand, and the most dramatic change, a rocky field where the ball can change direction after hitting the ground, turning throw-ins into corners, poor attempts on goals and vice-versa."
Fight for Life (World)>Fight for Life>1996>ESRB - T (Teen)>Atari Games>Atari Corporation>Fighter>3.4>1-2 Players>Fight for Life is a 3D fighting game that takes place in hell.

Your  objective in each puzzle is simple: you must place all the colored tiles into the correct spaces on the board. The tricky part is that there is always one more tile than there are spaces.
