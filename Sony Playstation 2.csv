To stop them, a military alliance was set up between the Osean Federation and the Union of Yuktobanian Republics. These two great powers drove the Belkans back but their counter-invasion was cut short when the Belkans detonated 6 nuclear warheads on their own soil, preventing the alliance from advancing on them. This ended the great war and a time of peace has reigned. The Osean and Yuktobanian nations have remained allies. On the small remote, ""Sand Island"", off the western coast of Osea, a skilled veteran of the war named Captain Bartlett (callsign: ""Heartbreaker"") trains new pilots as the 108th Tactical Fighter Squadron, designated ""Wardog"" in the Osean Air Defense Force (OADF).

Tracks often have branching paths, but instead of offering alternative routes or short-cuts, they often lead to dead ends, forcing the racer to backtrack.  The Wii version supports local split-screen multiplayer games for up to four players. The karts are controlled through motion by holding the Wii Remote horizontally and then tilting left or right. The PS2 version supports split-screen games for two players and up to four players through Multi-Tap.

The FBI has shot down your ship while flying over planet Earth.  And it, quite literally, lands right on their doorstep.  After a series of FBI Agents swipe your ship, what option do you have other than to blow up everything in your path to get it back?****Alien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them.  The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin.  Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible.  Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill.****To help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection.  Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies.  You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them.****The GBA version of the game is identical in gameplay, however, with a few bosses removed (such as the robot bee and the FBI big-fisted tank robot).  The PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 versions of the game include a special ""PDA Game"" with very simple-looking graphics.  Your goal in this game is to kill all the agents by hopping on their heads, and then reach the exit.  Included with this game is a level editor, allowing you to make your own levels and then send them to friends if you have the Xbox or Xbox 360 version."

Throughout the game you will encounter several characters known as Reyvateils; Reyvateils have the unique ability to sing songs which can be crafted into powerful magic for attacking, healing, or defense. When a Reyvateil is in your party, she remains at the back during battles; you can give her commands on what songs to sing - the longer she sings, the more powerful the magic will become. However singing tires a Reyvateil, and if she sings for too long she becomes so tired the built up magic is lost so you need to make sure to give a command to activate the magic before that happens. Normally opponents don't attack a Reyvateil, only the characters on the front line. Occasionally though an enemy will target a Reyvateil; when this happens you need to make sure other characters protect her, for though Reyvateils can craft powerful magic they are mostly defenseless to enemy attacks! When all opponents in the battle have been defeated, the battle is won and points are earned which can level up your characters.****Throughout the game you will need to help Reyvateils learn more powerful song magic. To do this you will need to dive into a Reyvateils cosmosphere. The cosmosphere is the world of her mind consisting of her private thoughts and emotions; when there you can interact with the Reyvateil and help her overcome obstacles to learn new songs. However since you are viewing her private thoughts, you first need to gain the trust of the Reyvateil. This is done by interacting in the real world first by talking; talk topics can be found in various locations throughout the world and also after various events. When you have enough talk topics completed you can then dive to the next level in the Reyvateils mind.****Another important skill Lyner learns early on is Grathmelding; this allows you to combine various items to form new ones. To do so, you will first need to locate a recipe so you know what to combine as well as Grathnode crystal to aid the process. The required items can sometimes be bought in shops or may be found by exploring the world. The items you create may be necessary to get past certain obstacles, or can just help you out in battle.
Ar tonelico II - Melody of Metafalica (USA)>Ar tonelico II - Melody of Metafalica>2009>ESRB - T (Teen)>Banpresto Co., Ltd.>Gust>Role-Playing>4.4>1 Player>"In the world of Ar Ciel, the Reyvateil region is being threatened by an epidemic that's been killing the citizens. A knight from the Grand Bell, Croix, is sent there to deal with the epidemic. The people of Metafalss, lead by the Grand Bell, rebel against the Goddess who controls the world, in order to achieve their dream and create a utopia by singing a Song in the Hymnos language, called Metafalica - as the legend says.  Melody of Metafalica is an RPG, much like its predecessor, Melody of Elemia, that takes place one and a half years later. It is the second installment in the Ar tonelico series. The turn-based battle sequences from the random enemy encounters are split up into two phases. In the first one, Attack, the different characters can perform various attacks until a time gauge runs out. When there is a Reyvateil in the party, a member of the race who can wield magic by transforming sounds into energy, players can determine which magic to use and the moment to unleash it. In the second phase, Defend, enemies have the opportunity to attack and will target the (up to two) Reyvateil who are singing at the back of the party. The other characters must then defend by timing the defensive moves. The effectiveness of attacks is also often determined by how well the attacks are synced to the requests of the Reyvateil.  The game is largely centered around female heroines and it contains a dive system where Croix can dive into the mind (Cosmospheres) of certain Reyvateils to get to know their feelings and emotions. That game element plays out with text-heavy dating-style elements where the choices can alter the storyline and it is also the system through which new Song Magic is crafted. Diving can only be done to the three main characters in the game and Croix needs to commit to one, it is not possible to hop between them. New ""evil"" Reyvateil can be converted by using the Dive system and afterwards they will contribute to the party. These are equipped through an additional item slot that affects a character through offensive or defensive means."

Armored Core - Last Raven (USA)>Armored Core - Last Raven>2006>ESRB - T (Teen)>FromSoftware, Inc.>From Software>Simulation>3.6>1-2 Players>Armored Core: Last Raven is a mech combat game, the pilots are called Ravens, and is set about half a year after the events of Armored Core: Nexus. The three major corporations merged into the Alliance in order to rule the world - but a new faction, Vertex, challenges them. Smaller, independent gangs of Ravens called Warlords have grown more aggressive which does not help matters. 24 hours before Vertex plans to unleash full war on the Alliance - which is thought to have devastating consequences for the world - the player enters the scene in the shoes of a new Raven who eventually has to choose a side and play a major role in the conflict...  The game has a branching campaign structure and the progression depends on the player's choices. This leads to different missions to play and concludes in one of six endings. The missions, which are prefaced with voice-over briefings and emails to read, are action-oriented and straightforward; the player usually has to either defeat a number of enemies in the open, visit indoor levels or survive against a single, powerful Raven. The most important part is the mech customization in which the player can tune the performance of the robot and exchange parts. For the first time in the series, the outside parts (e.g. the head or the legs) have locational damage and can be destroyed during missions - for example, when an arm is destroyed the player can't use the equipped weapon anymore. Between story missions, the player can visit an arena and fight against other Ravens for training.  The PSP version has a few additional parts.

Viese and Felt have volunteered to find out what has happened and to prevent the world of Eden from being destroyed completely. With the aid of a magical sword called the Azure Azoth, Felt sets off through a gate to another world called Belkhyde to search for the answer to their trouble while Viesa remains in Eden to take care of things there.****Throughout the game you control Viesa and Felt on their quest. Viesa has just become an alchemist; with the help of the Mana spirits of the world, this gives her the ability to take various items and magically form new items. In order to create a new item, Viesa will need a recipe indicating what ingredients to combine as well as those ingredients. All of these items can be found in various locations throughout the lands, some in Eden and some in Belkhyde. Many of the items Viesa can create with alchemy will be of great help to Felt as he explores Belkhyde and fights in battles; since Felt doesn't have the ability to create items, they will need the help of a share ring which provides the ability to exchange items even though they are in two different worlds. To progress through the game, Felt will often need to coordinate with Viesa to get useful items for either solving puzzles or making battles easier. As Felt explores Belkhyde, he will meet numerous other characters and will need to undergo various quests in order to save Eden.****The battles in the game are turn based; there is a meter at the top of the screen showing each of the characters in the battle with the rightmost character having the next turn.

There are two basic types of attacks, break attacks which will send your opponents further left on the meter providing more time or an extra turn, and charge attacks which increase the skill meter. Each character also has special skills which can be used if you have enough points on the skill meter. Battles are encountered randomly; as you wander enemy infested areas, a meter on the screen begins blue in color and slowly fades to red; the closer to red the meter is, the greater your chances of encountering a random battle. As you defeat enemies, this meter will slowly drain; when the meter is empty, you have defeated all of the enemies in that area. As you win battles, experience points are earned allowing your characters to level up and become more powerful.****As you progress through the game, the story will unfold. You can learn more about the land and what's going on by talking to the many people you'll find as well as through cut scenes at various points.

She makes their lives miserable however and poisons the king, so they flee to a magical world brought to life through a story of their mother.

There is a falling block puzzle game where the colours of the rainbow need to be gathered by matching gems of an identical colour in a group of three, horizontally or vertically, while dark clouds appear and remove blocks. Many mini-games are often repeated multiple times for the different princesses.

The intro from the original series is used. Cylons Raiders, Colonial Vipers, and the Galactica itself use the original designs, Cylons themselves look like the original chrome toasters, and the reptilian race that created them (in the original series, not the reboot) make appearances.

In contrast to the main console version, this version is more similar to the predecessor. The only change which has made its way into this version is the wheelhouse system which shows shows the high risk zones of each batter.

Fighting across Nosgoth, goal is to make his way to the great city of Meridian and take control of this stronghold. However upon reaching the gates of the city, the army is challenged by the Serafan Order, an organized force of vampire hunters and it's leader, the magical Serafan lord. Kain engages the Serafan Lord in single combat, and is struck down and defeated, Kain's sword, the Soul Reaver, is claimed by his enemy. Unconscious for 200 years, Kain awakes under the care of the vampire Umah to a world he barely recognizes. Having lost it's army, the vampires have been hunted down by the Serafan and only a few remain. The city of Meridian is ruled under martial law by the Serafan Order and demands great things of it's citizens. Strange ""Glyph magic"" is used to power machines and fuel industry, but at the same time is deadly to vampires and used as wards throughout the city. Kain swears vengeance on the opponent who defeated him and seeks to reclaim his place as ruler of the vampires.****The Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2 is a 3rd person adventure game, more similar in perspective to Soul Reaver than the first Blood Omen game. The player controls from behind Kain's shoulder and can move him in different directions, attack, jump, use ""dark gifts"" and grab on to ledges. Kain's life energy steadily depletes and must be replenished constantly by drinking blood. Blood is found by consuming any living creature nearby, often requiring defeating an enemy through combat first. As Kain consumes blood, his meter is filled up. Once full, Kain gains additional health. Kain also learns new dark gifts throughout the game, by defeating boss creatures. Some gifts include: the ability to blend into mist, fire projectiles, use projectile telekinesis or make a great horizontal leap. Many of these abilities can be used to perform ""stealth kills"" which will instantly defeat a foe. Kain will fight using his bare hands, or by picking up daggers, swords, axes and other weapons. These weapons all attack differently, eventually breaking, and can also be thrown at enemies from afar.****The Serafan use Glyph magic, partially because it is deadly to vampires. Kain will often encounter areas where he is barred from progress because of Glyph barriers and must find a way around them. Additionally, glyphs function similar to electricity in that they power machines and switches. Many of the puzzles featured in Blood Omen 2 involve needing to create a glyph ""circuit"" in order to deliver power to a specific point. Glyph energy glows as it travels down it's connection, allowing the player to see exactly where the energy spark is."
Blood Will Tell - Tezuka Osamu's Dororo (USA)>Blood Will Tell - Tezuka Osamu's Dororo>2004>ESRB - M (Mature)>SEGA Corporation>Sega>Action>4.2>1-2 Players>Seduced by the power offered to him, a samurai allows harm to come to his infant son.  The son, fated to destroy the 48 Fiends, has 48 body parts removed, one by each demon.  The samurai sets the remains adrift along a river, where the still-living child is discovered by a kindly doctor.  After raising the child, the doctor operates on him, replacing his missing parts with mechanical ones.  Knowing the child's destiny, the doctor replaces his missing arms with sword arms, attaches a repeating rifle to one arm, and a cannon to one leg.  The game begins with the now-adult Hyakkimaru beginning his quest to reclaim his body parts from the Fiends.  Soon joined by the child-thief Dororo, the pair embark on a quest against ancient Japanese demons and the monsters they create.****Blood Will Tell is an action game where the player controls Hyakkimaru, a man whose body parts were stolen by demons when he was a child.  His destiny is to reclaim each of his body parts, which allow him to increase his stats such as HP and power, as well as optional special functions (for example, the eye displays the game in colour, while the vocal chords allow him to speak).  Hyakkimaru wields a sword, which can be used to attack enemies - he can also swap for his two smaller swords concealed within his arms.  As he uses the swords, they level up and increase in power.  Hyakkimaru can also charge up a sword attack, and if released at the correct time, is given the opportunity to enter a series of button presses for combos.  If the enemy is killed during this combo, the player can perform a finishing move with the Triangle button which can yield bonus items ranging from health items to swords.****Hyakkimaru is also outfitted with a repeating rifle and a cannon in his leg.  While these are very powerful, they both require their own ammo and cannot be used without it.  The gun can be fired rapidly at foes, while the cannon must be charged and aimed for a powerful shot.  Both of these weapons have the advantage of being long-range weapons, unlike his swords which must be used at close quarters.****At a certain point in the game, Hyakkimaru meets the child thief, Dororo.  Dororo often assists Hyakkimaru during combat, and can be issued commands, such as 'fight', 'evade', 'collect items' or 'search'.  Sometimes the pair will split up, and Dororo will be playable on his own.  These sections are more puzzle-based, with the thief pulling switches to activate puzzles, dodging traps, and stealing items.  Dororo can throw rocks from a distance, and later gets smoke bombs which are more incapacitating.

Her mission will take her from clearing out the walking dead and man-sized insects in the swamps of Louisiana to hunting down members of the secretive Gegengheist Gruppe branch of the Nazi military around the world, as well as the monsters they unwittingly awakened.****Rayne's primary weapons against both monsters and men are the blades attached to her arms, and as the game progresses she will gain additional attacks to string together. Rayne can also hold many weapons, such as pistols, shotguns, and sub machine guns, at once, but she is not overly attached to them and will discard any weapon that runs dry. Her enhanced vampiric strength even allows her to rip up mounted gun emplacements and fire them from the hip. Another vampiric strength is her ability to drain the blood out of any human she can grab in order to restore her health. By killing enemies Rayne's rage meter will fill, eventually allowing her to enter Blood Rage, slowing the world around her and gaining new combo attacks that can dismember or totally cut in half weaker opponents. Rayne's ability to perceive the world will grow as the game progresses as well, allowing her to see living things through walls, zoom in on distant targets, and speed up her perception that everything, herself included, appear to slow down.

This game is very fast-paced - you have to keep moving, because if you're on top of an exploding die, you get knocked out and you lose the game.****There are several modes of play in Bombastic - Trial Mode, where you try to clear 100 levels; Story Mode, where you progress through stages trying to solve preset puzzles and fight bosses, and Battle Mode, where you fight against four opponents and try to stay alive as long as you can. In addition to the standard Bombastic mode, you can also unlock classic Devil Dice mode, where the dice sink into the ground instead of exploding.
Bomberman Hardball (Europe)>Bomberman Hardball>2005>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.>Hudson>Puzzle>3.2>1-4 Players>"Bomberman Hardball is an action game with four different game modes: Arena, Tennis, Golf and Baseball. The three sports games tend towards the ""fun-sport"" category (relatively simple controls and physics), but are still grounded in the real rule set: there are no power-ups or special moves. The controls of all three sports follow the genre standards: in Tennis, the player walks towards the ball and hits it, Golf has the standard two-click controls and in Baseball the control switches between pitching (selecting a pitch type and aim) and batting (aiming the hit). All three modes feature either exhibition or tournament play; a few Bomberman characters with different abilities and other playing options, e.g. in Tennis the player can choose between single/double and different courts.  Arena has the standard Bomberman gameplay: multiple characters walk around in overhead maps and lay bombs in order to kill the competition. Bombing away destructible blocks may reveal power-ups which have positive (e.g. laying more bombs at once or higher walking speed) or negative (e.g. negating the positive power-ups) effects when picked up. Besides the classic deathmatch, there are also a few other game modes available: star battle (collecting stars), crown battle (the winner needs to find and pick up the crown) and point battle. Each match can also be customized, e.g. handicap, number of power-ups or time limit.  The Living Mode allows to create a custom character with unlockable outfits and view AI controlled matches. Except Baseball (restricted to two players), up to four players can participate in matches."

Boogie (USA)>Boogie>2007>ESRB - E10+ (Everyone 10+)>Electronic Arts, Inc.>Pipeworks Software, Inc.>Rhythm>3.1>1-2 Players>Boogie is a dance and Karaoke game.  Unlike most similar games, which use special pads to control the dancing, the Wii version makes use of the Wii remote. The nunchuck can also be used to control the facial expressions in Strike-a-pose sequences, but is not required. For karaoke, Boogie includes a USB microphone. Each song can be played as a dance or a karaoke game. Players either match the rhythm and pitch, or match the song's beats to dance. Variation and combos are encouraged, as too many similar moves will lower the score. By performing well in the dances, a Boogie meter is filled. When full the player can execute a special move. While dancing, bonus items appear such as multipliers, tokens and meter boosts.****The game features a story mode centered around an intergalactic singing and dancing competition. There are five different characters, each with a unique story. For all other modes of play, players can create custom avatars based upon the five base characters, with a chapter in the story mode for each of them. Token collected during gameplay can be traded in for new songs, stages and outfits. There is also a mode where players can manipulate the camera to record their own music videos.

Brave - The Search for Spirit Dancer (USA)>Brave - The Search for Spirit Dancer>2007>ESRB - E10+ (Everyone 10+)>Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Ltd.>VIS Entertainment>Platform>3.1>1 Player>"Brave is a young native American boy who lives in the forest. As he wants to become a warrior, the elderly shaman Grey Bear prepares an adventure and hides carvings that will grant him new skills. During the search, however, the village is brutally attacked by the demonic creature Wendigo. Brave is the only one who can defeat it, but in order to do that, he has to track the path of the mysterious shaman Spirit Dancer, discover his past, and find the means to defeat the evil force.****Brave is a 3D third-person platformer with puzzles. Set in worlds with different themes (ice world, volcanic world, wastelands, forest...), Brave can roam freely, but certain parts are only opened up after solving quests. The boy can jump, duck, climb, and do basic attack moves. While observing, for certain actions, and when using ranged weapons, a first-person view is available as well. During the adventure, Brave acquires new abilities, which allow him to track creatures by smell or their tracks, mimic animals' sounds to lure or distract them, summon creatures, or invoke shaman powers to become an animal (an eagle, a bear, a rabbit and even a skunk). Health is acquired by killing animals or destroying vegetation. Brave can also collect up to five eagle feathers, which allow him to stock up on shaman power that provides superior strength for a short time.****The exploration gameplay has been mixed with action sequences, where you canoe down river rapids, or ride on a buffalo or an eagle while fighting. There is a strong emphasis on movement and platform-jumping, and there is an adjustable difficulty level, reflected in the amount of hints Grey Bear provides through a ""mobile stone"". Next to the abilities, there are different weapons to be found, such as spears, tomahawks and bows. Additionally, Brave can search for secret totems that open up concept art in the menu."
Breath of Fire - Dragon Quarter (USA)>Breath of Fire - Dragon Quarter>2003>ESRB - T (Teen)>Capcom Co., Ltd.>Capcom>Role-Playing>4>1 Player>"The world is called Deep Earth. The world is a huge underground complex of cities and labyrinths. The world is populated by people who have never seen the sky and the sun in their lives. The world is dark and hostile, and knows no mercy. Technology is well developed in this world, but the society is ruled by a cruel law, dividing all the citizens into classes, depending on the their D-ratio - a form of identifying people and assigning to them a social status at the same time. This is the reality of mankind somewhere in a fantasy universe, where the hero Ryu is thrown into. ****Ryu is a simple guard, a ranger with a low D-ratio - his job is to help to protect the citizens from genics - artificial monsters who have gone wild. During one of such routine patrols, Ryu runs into a mysterious silent girl named Nina, and saves her from a monster. Willing to protect her, Ryu discovers in himself a devastating power. He is now determined to do something for the society of Deep Earth - and perhaps to guide them to the surface of the planet...****""Dragon Quarter"" is a radical departure from the previous titles of the long-running series, and from standard console-style RPGs in general. The game is built as a huge dungeon crawler, with no overworld map. The combat is much more strategic than usually: each character has action points (AP), which can be used to move around the screen during an enemy encounter, and to perform a variety of combo attacks. There is no magic in the game, and many of the items you find in dungeons are random. All the enemies are visible on screen. Depending on who first initiated a physical contact, your party or the enemies get an extra turn in battles. The game allows (and even encourages) the player to restart the game from the beginning, keeping the items and the party experience (extra experience you get from battles and from treasure chests, which you can store and then assign to any of the characters). The game also features a special counter - Ryu can use his traditional dragon transformation abilities, but the counter raises with each such transformation, and when the counter reaches 100, the game is over. Raising your D-ratio allows you to access new areas every time when you re-play the game."

For the Windows version the game is no longer controlled through the mouse, but now through the keyboard, for the movement of the characters as well as all the actions. The player alternately controls George or Nico. Next to typical adventure gameplay such as exploration, conversations, and searching and combining items, there are also a few action sequences. The characters can duck, sneak, hang from ledges and move crates to reach higher areas.****The locations visited throughout the game include The Congo, Paris, England, Czech Republic and Egypt.

In Career mode, after creating an avatar, players compete against the computer to work their way up from amateur to professional. The player character will increase in skill (e.g. strength, accuracy) and earn money while playing. This money can be used to buy clothing or a new bowling ball, which also affects skill. Quick Play mode, as the name suggests, allows for a quick round of bowling for one to four players.  Making a throw is a little bit different depending on the platform the game is played on. Lining up on the alley to decide the direction of the ball stays the same, but on PlayStation 2 and PSP it's also necessary to set its spin. The next step is rolling the ball. On the Wii this is done by swinging the Wiimote and releasing the trigger button, where the speed of the release determines the spin of the ball. In the other versions a sickle-shaped meter is shown; pulling down on the analog stick sets the accuracy, and pushing it forward the strength of the release.

Burnout (USA)>Burnout>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.>Criterion Games>Driving>3.8>1-2 Players>"Burnout is a arcade style racing game in the mold of the Test Drive or Need For Speed series.  In this game, you are racing on realistic streets with real traffic to contend with.****There are 6 courses on which to race, 3 of which are reminiscent of Europe, and 3 from the USA.  There are several vehicles to choose from, ranging from compact cars to pickups.  However, they are not based on real makes and models.****One notable feature of Burnout is the ""Burn Meter.""  The Burn Meter is a gauge that is filled by performing reckless stunts, like racing into oncoming traffic, or power-drifting through corners.  Once the Burn Meter is filled, your car gets a super speed boost."
Burnout 2 - Point of Impact (USA)>Burnout 2 - Point of Impact>2002>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.>Criterion Games>Driving>3.9>1-2 Players>"Racing a car is one thing, but racing into traffic at high speeds, where you are rewarded for the style of your crash, is another. This is the idea behind Burnout 2, which brings new modes and higher speeds compared to the original title. As usual, the aim is to speed around real life roadways, through the traffic ahead, while keeping all 4 wheels on the ground. ****Burnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing.  Unlike many games which focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure.  Designers have built an entire city and surrounding areas, and implement the race courses throughput the countie's streets.  As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races.  As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving.  Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost ""burnout"" meter.  Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to dive past buses, trucks and anything else that gets in the way.  The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get!****Burnout 2 contains a full campaign and custom car campaign.  While you can unlock regular cars and tracks, later in the campaign you unlock more raceways like reverse tracks and one-way sprints.  You can unlock over 20 cars like a Nascar, a 1920's gangster car, a Japanese muscle, and many customized vehicles with custom paint jobs and upgraded stats.  ****Along with the same sense of speed and highly detailed crash animations as before, Point of Impact packages new modes of play.  Pursuit mode has you playing the cop as you chase down the speeding motorists, and to win you must crash them out of the race.  Or you can reverse that with a friend.  You can flee from a friend while he attempts to chase you.  Crash mode, as the name suggests, forces you to glide into crowded intersections to get the most cars involved in a pile-up as possible.  The bigger the crash, the better.  Up to 4 players can compete for the best score.****Training and 2 player racing modes are also included."

The more cars you take out, damage you inflict, the more events and cars you can unlock. Burnout 3 also has a ""crash"" mode which puts your vehicle at a variety of traffic junctions jam-packed with moving vehicles and pickups to see just how much monetary damage you can inflict.****Burnout 3: Takedown continues the racing series with more cars, more tracks, a more detailed crash engine, and a multitude of new gameplay modes for single players, multiple players on one system, and online play.****Some features include:****Crash Mode: In addition to this gameplay element introduced in Burnout 2, Pick-ups have been added.

The game is mainly focused on returned Burnouts feature - draining a complete boost meter without stopping wich was last seen in Burnout 2: Point of Impact. With return of Burnouts feature there were four new game modes added including Maniac Mode (players need to drive dangerously to get highest scores by earning drifts, air, oncoming and near misses. Chaining Burnouts in this mode increases the score multiplier), Drift Challenge (in this mode player need to obtain as many feet of drifting as possible. Chaining Burnouts also increases the score multiplier here), Near Miss Challenge (same as Drift Challenge, but player needs to score near miss bonuses), Burnout Challenge (also same as Drift Challenge, but focusing on obtaining Burnouts score).**However, some options have been removed from the game - for instance Burnout Dominator doesn't feature Crash Mode, there is also no Traffic Checking Mode and Online Multiplayer.

This is emphasized by impact time, which shows crashes in all their slowed-down glory, and the boost you receive after a successful wrecking. Reckless driving bumps your Revenge rank, unlocking new events. This can also be achieved by medal placings that grant new vehicles.****Collectible signature takedowns, crashbreakers (detonate your vehicle, now also in some regular races) and aftertouch for precise havoc remain, but one of the major changes is the ability to check traffic. Non-racing vehicles are no longer a nuisance with the sole purpose of slowing you down. They can now be actively used to obstruct traffic or send them into your foes. The Road Rage mode (take down a set number of rivals within a time limit) and Crash mode make a return, but Traffic Attack is new - race against the clock and level the traffic at the same time. Other modes include regular races, grand prix races, Burning Lap (high-speed time attack), Eliminator (last one after each round is out) and a normal time attack mode.****In the Crash mode, the multipliers and bonuses have been removed, and you cannot drive at full speed towards a crossroads. You have to time your start to receive a proper boost and then it is only about steering, crashbreakers and aftertouch. There are many new tracks and cars, a soundtrack with lots of famous artists, and a new world tour in different countries.****Online multiplayer is available for up to six players.

Buzz! Junior - RoboJam (USA)>Buzz! Junior - RoboJam>2008>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Ltd.>Cohort Studios>Quiz>3.1>1-4 Players>As part of the PlayStation 2’s holy trinity of casual gamer friendly franchises, which also includes EyeToy and SingStar, Buzz! is one of those rare cases where being a one trick pony is exactly what makes it so appealing. The initial games were simple interactive quiz games, whose big gimmick was that they came with a set of special game show buzzer controllers instead of relying on the traditional DualShock controller. The Buzz! Junior games though are a slightly different affair – you still use the simple five button buzzers, but to play mini-games not answer questions. As a sequel to Jungle Party this actually does pretty well, with a much more consistent range of mini-games than the original. There’s no separate single player mode any more though, with computer controlled opponents simply filling in the gaps. There’s also not much of a plot either, as you simply compete with other primary coloured robots at the Robot Academy. Thankfully this doesn’t involve a two hour maths exam, but instead mini-games like rhythm action variant Octo Beat, hammer throwing (but with robots), Whack-A-Mole with aliens, and cybernetic basketball. Few of the mini-games are genuinely original, and there are only twenty-five, but they are at least all entertaining. The only caveat to all this is that, unlike things like Mario Party, this is strictly for very young children. No one with an age in double digits is going to tolerate it for very long – but then that’s largely the point, since so few games are aimed at very young kids nowadays. Particularly if you’ve already got the buzzer controllers from a previous game (or aim to use them again) this is actually quite an effective form of interactive child quietener. Harrison Dent

The first takes place at the beginning of the war in the South Pacific as the player takes control of Pvt. Joe Miller serving with the American 2nd Marine Division as they start out in basic training in North Carolina. This level lets the player learn the controls of the game and then fastforwards to the Guadalcanal (as though the training mission was a flashback) where the player must survive with his company.  There are four more missions, two on the island of Betio and two on the island of Saipan.****The second part takes place in Europe after D-Day with four missions divided by two different experiences. The first two has the player take command of Pvt. Lucas Gibson of the American 80th Infantry Division as he and his squad make their way through Luxembourg and finally through Bastone mounted on a Sherman tank, trying to break through Nazi lines.  The last two missions let the player take control of Pvt. Tom Sharpe of the British 6th Airbone Division, battling through the ruins of Bastone and the town of Bure.****The third part only consists of two missions that are divided between Pvt. Sharpe and Pvt. Gibson and is set in the closing days of the war in Europe. The first mission takes place in Wesel where Pvt. Sharpe and his division must find a way across the Rhine. The second has Pvt. Gibson and his division battle through the town of Braunau am Inn, the birthplace of Adolph Hitler, as they need to stop a V2 rocket from being launched.****The last campaign reverts back to Pvt. Joe Miller at the end of the Pacific Theatre, this time with two missions on the island of Okinawa, with the last mission having the player take Castle Shuri in an attempt to capture Okinawa and open the gate to the Japanese mainland.****The gameplay is of the first-person shooter kind and is told through in game cutscenes as well as stock footage of World War II, both black & white and color. The controls are basic, with a main weapon and secondary along with two grenades (smoke and frag).  Movement is done through the left analog stick with aiming through the right one. Players can fire their weapon using the ""R1"" button and switch between using ""Triangle"", manually reloading them using the ""Square"" button and aim down the sight using the ""L1"" button. Jumping and hurling obstacles (when prompted) is done through the ""X"" button, a melee attack can be obtained through the ""R3"" button and sprinting through the ""L3"" button. The ""O"" button is used for crouching while holding the button down will let the player's character prone.****Players can obtain ammo through fallen comrades and new weapons by standing over top of the weapon and holding the ""Square"" button. Likewise, fallen enemy weapons can be obtained this way. There is no number of preset lives and once a player is killed he can restart from a previous checkpoint.  There is no health bar system, instead it resembles Medal of Honor: Vanguard where once the player starts to sustain an considerable amount of damage, the view will start to become red. This can be stopped by taking cover away from enemy fire which will allow the players health to replenish."
Call of Duty 2 - Big Red One (USA)>Call of Duty 2 - Big Red One>2005>ESRB - T (Teen)>Activision Publishing, Inc.>Treyarch>Shooter>3.6>1-16 Players>In the second Call of Duty game for consoles, players again take to battle in The Second World War.  As with other Call of Duty games, focus is on the characters and their drama amidst the furious, heavily scripted, first-person action.  As a private new to war in America's most legendary infantry division, nicknamed the Big Red One for the distinctive patch they wore, players will fight through the game as a team in the Fighting First, and will be affected by the loss of friends on the battlefield.****Players will have to re-enact the successes of World War II through a wide variety of land, sea and air missions in Africa, Sicily and Normandy, by using vehicles including tanks, jeeps, armored cars and half-tracks.  Success will depend on how well players can move, shoot and complete the objectives that a commanding officer provides before each mission.****The Xbox and PS2 versions offer multiplayer games with up to 16 players.
Call of Duty 3 (USA)>Call of Duty 3>2006>ESRB - T (Teen)>Activision Publishing, Inc.>Treyarch>Shooter>3.6>1-16 Players>The third main Call of Duty game centers around Operation Cobra in Normandy, France, the World War II operation planned by United States Army General Omar Bradley to break out from the Normandy area after the previous month's D-Day landings. You play as 4 allied sides with American, Canadian, British and Polish soldiers in 14 chronological singleplayer missions covering the 88 days leading up to the liberation of Paris. Surprisingly, you cannot play as the French 2nd Armored Division that actually liberated Paris.****The battles are usually dramatic with many fights and scripted events at the same time, consisting of infantry and vehicles, with semi-destructible environments. In between, there are cinematics that explain the events. A few gameplay mechanics have been kept intact or make a return: slight auto aim, the damage system that allows you to recover if you hide for a moment, and smoke grenades. New features include the ability to toss back unexploded grenades and actions requiring a successful series of button combinations. This can occur in hand-to-hand combat where you can yank the weapon out of enemy soldiers' hands. Enemies work in groups, try different tactics and search for cover.****The main multiplayer modes are standard deathmatch (battle), team deathmatch (team battle), Capture the Flag (either with two flags or two sides trying to control a single, neutral flag) and Headquarters (two sides either defend or attack a structure, and players can now respawn after dying). The new mode, War, is similar to the gameplay of the Battlefield series. Two teams start with two control points each, and one neutral flag in the middle. The objective is to control all five flags.****There are multiple-occupancy vehicles (Sherman Tank, Panzer IV, Jeep, Horch, BMW, Harley), and several multiplayer classes: Rifleman, Heavy Assault, Light Assault, Medic, Scout, Support and Anti-Armor. Each class has unique abilities. There are also two rankings: a normal rank system during a single game where your abilities improve if you do well, and an overall TrueSkill ranking. Also, unlike the previous games, your team stays grouped together after a match and is not booted back to the lobby right away.

Cold Winter (USA)>Cold Winter>2005>ESRB - M (Mature)>Sierra Entertainment, Inc.>Swordfish Studios>Shooter>4>1-8 Players>"In ""Cold Winter"", you play the role of Andrew Sterling, a former member of MI6, the British secret intelligence service. Andrew is caught preparing to assassinate someone in China, and is thrown into prison. There he faces torture and imminent execution. But a former friend from his MI6 days arranges to rescue him and offers him a job, having planned in advance to manipulate him so that he is unable to refuse. The first task seems fairly ordinary: to track down a weapons dealer who has been supplying terrorists.****But soon Andrew's mission becomes more important, because he must deal with a sinister conspiracy that embraces the whole world. In the story, there is a secret society called the Greywings, which slowly began to form form after World War I. The organization dedicated itself to stopping nuclear weapons proliferation by any means. Their obsessive leader, John Grey, finally decided that this effort is hopeless. He set in motion a plan calculated to cause the nuclear war he had been trying to prevent for his whole life, reasoning that it is better to have the war under controlled conditions, because it would have happened sooner or later.****He set the plan in motion by developing an information warfare program called Octopus, He sold Octopus widely on the black market, so that it would proliferate rapidly and many groups would fight to control it. Octopus is designed to fool its buyers, so each will believe the program lets them take over a wide variety of nuclear weapons control networks in various countries. But this is not so. For on the prearranged ""test"" date, Octopus  will give remote control of several nuclear arsenals to the remaining members of the Greywings secret society -- not to the program's buyers, who will receive all the blame. It is Andrew Stirling who must stop the plan from working. He must track them down and follow them to 'Winterlong,' a hidden bunker in the Arctic, where they have taken shelter.****In this first-person shooter, you can collect over 20 weapons to kill your enemies. You can only carry two of them simultaneously, although it is also possible to use grenades. You can make weapons by combining items you find. For example, a fuel can, a bottle, and  cloth combine to make a Molotov cocktail. A business card and some poison make a business card that is poisoned. You shouldn't worry about finding healing items, though, because you carry along an unlimited health pack. You need to remember to use this at the proper time, though, or of course you will still be killed. In combat, you can use various objects to help you. For example, you can throw pots at your enemies Large objects such as chairs, desks, and even wheeled carts can be pushed to block the enemy's path or to provide limited cover for yourself.****The game has replay value, because to some extent, it is possible to take the roles of two other primary characters in the story. Replay value also comes from the fact that enemies react in unscripted, sensible ways. They move cleverly, respond to alarms, change posture, take cover, divide themselves, and work in groups. Depending on how quickly you are able to react, they are likely to send someone to get reinforcements, and they yell for help. Finally, there is a sense of realism. Perceptions become confused when the character is under stress. Graphical quality is good.  Also, Cold Winter uses flashbacks to explain what has already happened, so there is a sense of knowing how the characters have reached their current places in the story."

The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short. ****In the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly.****Next to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B or A, with S for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).

When the screen tells players that they're about to be called upon to hit the ""left"" button as its corresponding glyph ascends up the screen, they must try to match it precisely at the moment of the glyph's overlap with a target area at the top of the screen.  DDR games being what they are, this is all synchronized to player-selected electro-pop music with music video or animated dancing avatar sideshows, and of course is intended for play with the series' trademark control device, a giant four-way directional pad laid on the floor to be rhythmically walked upon.  (Two can be used simultaneously for two players or one who boasts some simply spectacular dance moves.)****After the attainment of various in-game achievements have granted the players sufficient points to ""buy"" an initially-locked handful in the in-game ""store"", this game offers up 72 different songs (some in a fragmentary form) in a variety of styles from Konami's J-pop stable as well as regionalised tunes from recognized Western artists.****In addition to the standard ""pick three songs and see how high a cumulative score you can rack up, supposing you don't get prematurely booted due to low performance"" game mode, the game offers variant play types: ""hyper master"" mode (taking on extra tasks in order to earn achievements such as Supportive Modules to make things easier and Challenge Modules to make them tougher), workout mode (to help calculate calories burned and long-term exercise routines), advanced modes (initial options include battle -- competitive vs. the computer or a human player -- or course, running through a selected playlist... and eventually unlocking survival mode, endless mode, and the combo challenge mode), training mode (to help learn the steps to a particular song), and edit mode (for custom programming of your own choreographed dance steps!)"

Points are awarded for accuracy with bonus multipliers awarded for making certain 'combos' (mini-routines within a song which are deemed especially difficult or long).

The game has a workout mode in which the player first enters their weight, in kilograms, and then selects a track. Gameplay here is basically the same as the main game but instead of points the game calculates the number of calories burned. There is no difficulty setting for this game mode and the arrows come thick and fast.  The Recorder option allows the player to create and save their own dance, there is no high score for this and while the dance moves are preserved from one game to the next only one routine can be saved.

You improve your character through a slow progression of leveling up from experience points and finding better equipment or purchasing it from villagers.  Each mission you accomplish improves the economy, research or military stats of the village you are doing it for, which is what determines which items they have available for purchase.****There are three basic monster-types: Undead, Forgotten and Mutants.  There are seven basic types of melee weapons.  Two each do extra damage to each type of monster and the final does extra damage to groups.  There are also four kinds of guns and a variety of bombs.****The object of the game is make Anna into an all-powerful warrior through battling and questing before a year is up and the Shadow Lord attacks.  This takes upward of 100 hours of game time.  At this point, she must defeat the Shadow Lord for good.
Dark Cloud (USA)>Dark Cloud>2001>ESRB - T (Teen)>Sony Computer Entertainment Incorporated>Level 5>Role-Playing>3.3>1 Player>400 Years ago, a war between the Eastern Continent and the Western Wizard Army destroyed the world as a great power was unleashed. Time has passed and in present day, the power-hungry General Flag has organized a ritual to awaken this power once more: the Dark Genie. Barely controlled by a spell, the Dark Genie once again breaks the world, beginning with the village of Norune. The only survivor of Norune is a boy named Toan, son of the great hero Ada. As Toan surveys the destruction, the Spirit King appears and tells him that all is not lost; pieces of the world, including buildings and people, have been sealed away in protective Atla spheres. Using a magic glove called the Atlamillia, Toan must resurrect the world and find the powers necessary to defeat the Dark Genie.****Dark Cloud is an action-RPG title, often compared to Soul Blazer, played from the 3rd person perspective. Toan must enter randomly generated dungeons where he will battle monsters and recover Atla spheres. Toan battles with a sword, which can be slashed directly in front of him or powered up for a stronger blow. During his travels, Toan encounters other characters who will offer to aid him and can be switched to during dungeons, with individual statistics and weapons. Items are also found and shared among the party, including restorative items, attack items and general power-ups. Each character has a thirst meter, which much be replenished or health will start to drain. Should a character lose all their health, they will fall in battle and be returned to town unless Stand-In powder is used, in which case that character is unavailable and control passes to another.****Toan is the only character able to collect Atla spheres which contain different items needed to restore the villages destroyed by the Dark Genie. Rebuilding is done outside the dungeon in a designated village area. Buildings can be placed down, rotated and moved as need be. They can also be upgraded with additional furniture and people (usually the owners of the building). As the dungeons are conquered and the area becomes more lifelike, treasure chests start appearing around the town and villagers often become friendlier. Some villagers have additional requests, such as being placed facing the east, for the placement of their homes.****Each character in Toan's party uses a unique weapon, but several different types of weapon under each category can be collected. As weapons are used, they gain Absorption (Abs). These Abs points are used as &quot;experience&quot; for the weapon and can upgrade the weapon's abilities. Each weapon features a number of &quot;slots&quot; to which power-up items can be attached, any items attached to slots will be absorbed when the weapon is upgraded. Each weapon has certain attributes which must be improved in order to &quot;build up&quot; to a different type of weapon. Additionally, any weapon reaching level 5 can be broken into a Synthsphere, an item containing 60% of its abilities, which can then be attached to slots on different weapons. In this manner, weapons can always be upgraded or used in the improvement of another weapon throughout the game. The game also features certain sequences where buttons must be pressed in the correct order and correct timing in order to progress.

The game world is somewhat expansive and fairly open to accommodate different approaches to solving the same problems, depending on he player's preferred style of play.

Combat takes place in the same interface, mostly in the style of a first person shooter.

Under the Union's protection are the Hierarchs and the Goddess, currently Caim's sister Furiae, who is a human manifestation of one of the four seals that protect the world from being broken. As the game begins, Cain is fatally wounded in a battle with the Empire. Encountering a captured Red Dragon who is also near death, Caim makes a fateful choice. In exchange for both their lives, the Red Dragon and Caim will enter a pact. This pact will forever chain their lives to one another and link their souls, at the cost of something irreplaceable. Recharged with the fires of a Dragon, Caim's vengeance burns over the enemy...****The player controls Caim on his quest. The game is separated into three distinct modes: Aerial combat, Ground combat and Event Combat. In Aerial Combat, Caim rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Caim, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield. These are leveled up through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. Though magic (determined by weapon choice), timed attacks and evasion, Caim breaks through enemy armies. Characters recruited as allies by Caim can also be summoned during battles, steadily losing health until control is returned to Caim. In ground combat, Caim may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. The Dragon's movements are generally the same as in aerial combat but more limited and less agile. Event combat is similar to Ground combat, but shown isometrically, restricted to a single weapon and without the aid of a dragon. It is used mainly to tell story sequences.****Levels that have been visited before might become ""Expedition Missions"" which are optional and contain new objectives, enemies and weapons. Additionally, any level previously played in the storyline may be revisited at any time.

The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Nowe, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield. Each type of weapon can only be equipped by a specific character, and so changing to a new weapon  type will also change the playable character from Nowe to another member of his party. These weapons are leveled up, gaining new combos and more powerful magic, through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. Accessories and items, such as healing and magic restorers, can also be found and used during combat. Though magic (determined by weapon choice), timed attacks and evasion, Nowe is able to defeat enemies and earn experience. Defeated enemies drop items and coins, though weapons are only found in treasure chests. In ground combat, Nowe may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. The Dragon's movements are generally the same as in aerial combat but more limited and less agile.****Progress in the game is shown on the world map. Levels that have been visited before might become ""Expedition Missions"" which are optional and contain new objectives, enemies and weapons.

The game still has a GTA-style open-ended design, though, and you can still exit your vehicle for some on-foot action. However, there's no reason to exit your vehicle unless it's damaged and you can no longer drive it, as almost all of the game's missions involve cop car chases. If that's the case, then you can either go to the repair shop to repair your vehicle, or just steal someone else's vehicle! Until then, you can punch the cops with your fists and steal their weapons when they're dead, so that you can use them for future on-foot combat.****The game takes place in both 1978 (before TK went to prison) and in 2006. The 2006 setting has a much more modern soundtrack than the 1978 setting, which has a mostly disco soundtrack. Obviously, the 2006 setting has the architecture, technology, and cars of today.

Dynasty Warriors 3 (USA)>Dynasty Warriors 3>2001>ESRB - T (Teen)>KOEI Co., Ltd.>Omega Force>Beat-'Em-Up>3.4>1-2 Players>About 1800 years ago in China, there were three fearless warriors battling for ultimate control over the country. One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared the same swarmed under each leader.  These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way.****They followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors.****Dynasty Warriors 3 takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win. Each character has their own unique weapon type and magic ability, although they can share weaker variations of weapons with other characters who use the same style of weapon. Weapons and items are dropped randomly from boxes in levels as well as from defeated enemy generals, and each has a range of stats dependent on the difficulty level and the strength of the general. The most powerful weapons and items, however, can only be collected by completing hidden objectives as each character. Characters grow more powerful by collecting stat up items from defeated generals, and doing well in levels rewards points that level up the bodyguards who follow the player character.****Most completed levels can be replayed with any character and any side in free mode. An encyclopedia is included as well that details every event and character from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, even those that never appear in Dynasty Warriors 3.

The heart of the game, campaign mode, begins by choosing any of 24 regions and 42 rulers (custom characters can be created). Beginning with a small kingdom, the ultimate goal is the conquering of all others. Each turn, the player is given a choice from 4 different governing options (brought to your attention by your generals) followed by a single decision of action. These actions typically include the invasion or defense of a specific province or the option to aid an allied empire with those same actions.****In any battle, be it offense or defense, the player chooses up to three generals and three lieutenants and their troops to form the army. Soldiers fill the battlefield with different ranks and styles (normal, archers, guards, sorceresses and 2 types of siege weapons) as well as horses which can be riden. The player, in 3rd person perspective, may guard, parry, attack, charge, fire arrows, jump, announce or charge up to unleash a special musou attack. All generals and lieutenants are displayed on the map and may be attacked or challenged. Enemy characters who are defeated enough times in a battle can be challenged to a duel. The obvious goal of the battlefield is to control strongholds at strategic points that will make it easier to defend or reach a certain area or opponent. At any given time, these stronghold areas are under control of either of the two sides. They are won by defeating all of the opposing forces in the immediate area. Strongholds routinely generate health recovery items. The winner of a offensive action can win territory and capture enemy soldiers. Each province under control of an empire nets that empire 100 gold each turn which may be spent on various governing decisions.****The game also features a 2-player mode where players compete against one another in 4 different styles: Defeat more enemies (Vanquish), Collect more treasure (Pilfer), Knock more enemies off a wall (Melee) and a test of survival (Endurance).

In rounds 3 and 4, the stakes are higher. In round 5, two people from the winning team work together to find common answers to questions before time runs out.

Unlike many licensed titles, this third-person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay.****Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka ""Doctor Doom"" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few.****The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials.****To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player."

Possum thinks these notes were written by his uncle before he died. He considers for a while, and then says to himself: ""This will enable me to catch the biggest fish the world has ever seen!"" ""I may achieve my dream and be granted the title of professor!"" And so Possum's quest begins! "
Fitness Fun (Europe)>Fitness Fun>2006>ESRB - E (Everyone)>505 Game Street>Tamsoft>Sports>3.3>1 Player>Fitness Fun is an exercise-themed rhythm game starring D3 Publisher's virtual idol Riho Futaba. Riho is putting on a special concerts for the 5th anniversary of her debut, and her manager has asked her to do dance aerobics training to perfect her rhythm. During each song, a cursor scrolls across a set of four bars with notes arranged on them in time with the music. The player must move the cursor to as many notes as possible, and press the button on the controller in time with the music to dance along. Play well, and Riho will stay with the rhythm and earn points, but play poorly and she will start to get out of breath. If too many wrong notes are played, the song will be failed and end early. Extra songs and costumes can be unlocked by beating preset scores in the Lesson mode. There are a total of 12 songs and 14 costumes to unlock. It is also possible to save replays of performances to watch later without the note bar obscuring the view of Riho. A highly popular pin-up model, has been instructed by her manager to develop a sense of rhythm in order to prepare for her 5th anniversary concert. Can she get through this tense moment of her career in one piece?! Will she be able to perfect her routine in time?! As the concert draws near, her anxiety grows. 
FlatOut (USA)>FlatOut>2005>ESRB - T (Teen)>Empire Interactive Entertainment>Bugbear>Driving>3.4>1-4 Players>FlatOut is a driving game where crashing your car can be more fun than racing it.  You drive muscle cars around dirt tracks, battle them on destruction derby arenas, and take part in Ragdoll Olympics.  That last one may need some explanation.  When you crash in FlatOut, your driver (the Ragdoll) is flung through the windscreen, very much like in Rekkaturvat.  This feature is used in the Ragdoll sports where the task is to propel the hapless driver as far, as high, or as accurately as possible.  On the demolition arena the goal is to wreck other cars before yours is.  Simple as that.****The bulk of the game is racing though and it can be performed in typical quick race and time trial modes in addition to the proverbial career mode.  There are also two different handling modes for the cars.  Normal mode gives arcade type handling, suitable for gamepads.  Professional mode seems to be designed for steering wheel owners and provides very challenging simulator-type handling.  Not surprisingly since Bugbear's previous racing title Rally Trophy was considered to be very challenging, even demanding, simulation.****Bugbear's experience with simulation dynamics shows in FlatOut.  Almost everything on the track can be run into and it behaves as it should in real life.  Or at least as in a car-chase movie.  Stuff that cars scatter around are there on the next lap too and cars are gradually dismantled when hit to other cars or solid objects around the track.****Multiplayer modes are of course great party hits.  Depending on platform, FlatOut has hotseat, split screen, LAN, and/or online multiplay modes.
FlatOut 2 (USA)>FlatOut 2>2006>ESRB - T (Teen)>Empire Interactive Europe Ltd.>Bugbear>Driving>4.2>1-8 Players>As in FlatOut your goal is to drive as reckless as you can and still win the race. But contrary to its predecessor, FlatOut 2 is now a complete arcade-racing game.****The core of the game is the career mode which features 3 different racing-classes: Derby, Race and Street. Every class is also divided into 3 levels. You begin your career in the derby class level 1. Here you drive old, wrecked cars straight from the dump. As you progress to the race class and finally to the street class you can buy better and faster cars which you can then also tune to your needs, like installing a new engine.****Inside the classes you find different kinds of events: from normal races over Destruction Derbies to stunt events. All of the events feature a fully destructible environment. This is not only eye-candy but is also required to fill up your nitro and handicap your enemies.****If you get bored of that, you can play one of the 12 mini-games. Like in FlatOut your goal here is to do all kinds of crazy stuff with your driver. You can use him as a football, throw him through burning rings and more. These mini-games can also be played with up to 8 players on one PC in a hot-seat mode.
Flintstones - Bedrock Racing, The (Europe)>Flintstones - Bedrock Racing, The>2007>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Blast! Entertainment Ltd>Coyote Console>Driving>3.5>1-2 Players>In The Flintstones: Bedrock Bowling, Fred Flintstone is toiling away as usual at his thankless construction job. When it's quitting time, his boss threatens him with summary termination if he does not finish his trench-digging assignment by the next morning. The biggest dilemma for Fred is that he needs to practice for an upcoming bowling tournament. The benevolent alien named The Great Gazoo materializes and solves the problem by digging a trench and lining it with giant bowling pins. He then gives Fred a large bowling ball half shell in which to play live action bowling.  The action in Bedrock Bowling takes the form of steering the bowling shell down 8 different lanes. Each lane has 10 pins that the player must try to hit. Additionally, there are many diamonds, birds, and other powerups along the way to be collected for points.  The 8 lanes are Gravel Factory, Quarry, Flooded, Tar, Freeway, Crystal Mine, Lava, and Rockzilla.

Ford Bold Moves Street Racing (USA)>Ford Bold Moves Street Racing>2006>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Eidos, Inc.>Razorworks Studios>Driving>3.7>1-2 Players>Ford Bold Moves Street Racing is the third Razorworks-developed title in the licensed Ford Racing series since they took over development in Ford Racing 2. Unlike its predecessors, this version has an urban atmosphere. The road races, off-road challenges and circuit tracks have been removed and the action has been taken entirely to the streets of Los Angeles, with 24 tracks available. As in the previous version, the 18 available cars are all Fords, ranging from the 1968 Mustang GT to the 2007 Shelby GT 500.****There are 4 main modes: Quick Race, Team Racing, Solo Racing and Multiplayer. Solo Racing offers quick races, and championships where new vehicles and tracks can be unlocked. The real novelty is the Team Racing mode, split up in single races, team championships, challenges and tutorials. Team Racing has the player control two or three vehicles in a single team during a race in modes such as Race, Elimination or Duel. The team with the highest point total wins, so the player either has to switch between the vehicles to drive (the others cars then become AI-controlled) or issue orders such as Block (slow down another vehicle) or Draft (additional speed in the slipstream) to influence the driving behaviour of the team mates. This can be extended to double or even triple actions of the same effect. Blocked cars have to brake and weave across the track until they regain control.****Racing or completing challenges earns credits, which can be spent to buy new vehicles in the showroom. Despite the urban theme, there are no tuning options. Cars can only be viewed, repaired and sold. ****The PSP version adds 6 new Ford cars (1962 Thunderbird Sports Roadster, 1971 Mustang Mach 1, 2004 Bronco Concept, 2005 Shelby GR-1 Concept, 2005 SVT Sport Trac Adrenalin Concept, 2005 Thunderbird) and 7 new tracks. In the Team Racing mode, two cars can be controlled (3 in the console versions) and solo and team multiplayer is supported over Wi-Fi.****There is also an alternate Australian PS2 release Ford Street Racing (XR Edition), with 4 additional cars synonymous with the history of Ford in Australia: the 1970 Ford XY GT Falcon, the 1970 Ford XY GTHO Falcon (Phase III), the 2003 Falcon XR8 Ute and the Australian Falcon XR8.

However, the computer's mind told her the humans must be destroyed as weak, imperfect beings, and a race of super-humans, the Galerians, must be created. But Rion, the hero of the first game, destroyed Dorothy in a dramatic battle. Now Rion is brought back to life and learns that Dorothy was able to execute a destructive program before her death. Once again, Rion must face and defeat Dorothy's creations, the Galerians.****""Galerians: Ash"" is an action-adventure along the lines of  Resident Evil and other survival horror titles. Rion can fight enemies using various psychic techniques. The more he uses a technique, and the more damage he sustains, the more ""addicted"" he becomes, and when the addiction meter reaches the limit, his hit points get gradually depleted, and he cannot walk normally anymore. Like in other survival horror games, you rely heavily on healing and restoring items. Enemies also drop items that would raise Rion's maximum hit points or make his weapons stronger, in a RPG-like fashion."

Gauntlet - Dark Legacy (USA)>Gauntlet - Dark Legacy>2001>ESRB - T (Teen)>Midway Games, Inc.>Midway>Beat-'Em-Up>3>1-4 Players>A port of the arcade game, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is the follow-up to Gauntlet: Legends and another installment in the long-running Gauntlet series of hack-and-slash action games. As with all the Gauntlet games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal. ****This version contains the characters and levels from Gauntlet: Legends, plus the new characters and levels from the Dark Legacy arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in.****There are eight characters to initially choose from: the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you'll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there are some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes. ****Unlike the early Gauntlet arcade games, the camera angle varies from location to location, from bird's eye to nearly ground level. The lands, creatures, and heroes are all rendered in 3D. While the graphics have been upgraded, the game play is very similar. You basically run around levels, hacking at what seems like unlimited armies of monsters, searching for gold, keys, and health-giving food...as well as a way out of the level. Bosses and other scripted events slow down the repetitious nature of the originals.****While levels can be gained and characters saved, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is an action game with some RPG trappings and should not be confused with the more true types from that genre.

In this strategy game, you become the scourge of humanity by managing haunting teams consisting of various ghosts. The levels, usually inspired by famous scenes from horror movies, require you to scare mortals and complete additional objectives such as freeing trapped ghosts. Deployed ghosts need to be bound to certain objects, called fetters, that match their type.****By scaring humans, you collect plasm, the main resource in the game. Plasm can be used to recruit new ghosts, or expand their abilities. Rather than deploying a massive amount of creatures, the game rewards creative use of limited resources to haunt mortals in original ways. Each human has a believe meter. An important aspect is figuring out each human's weakness. As you exploit this, they become more susceptible to various phenomena and provide more plasm. Along the way, you will meet fierce resistance as ghostbreakers, priests and witches can detect and ban your ghosts.****The game is not a direct port. Instead, Spiral House was contracted to modify the original codebase by Sick Puppies to make it more user-friendly for the consoles. This includes a complete overhaul of the interface to make commands easier to access, the introduction of battle elements - next to the regular missions - to speed up the game's pace, a more linear game structure, and a redesign of the control over ghosts. They now have less AI and there is more variety in the types, requiring you to tap wisely into the plasm pool to deploy the most adequate ghost for each situation.

Shortly after being hired a mysterious ghostly shock wave flows through New York City, prompting the Ghostbusters to begin an investigation. Over the course of the game they will return to many locations from the movies and meet returning characters as well as some new locations and characters.****As the Rookie the player must explore levels to find and capture any ghosts while being assisted by fellow Ghostbusters following you. A ghost must first be weakened using any of the proton pack weapon modes it is vulnerable to, then by dragging the stunned ghost to a trap placed by the player or their teammates. Other enemy types must be defeated by first revealing a weak point and then pulling it out with the proton pack's blast stream, or by simply dealing enough damage to the enemy. If the Rookie takes too much damage themselves they will be knocked unconscious, and their allies will attempt to get to them and help them back up. The Rookie can do the same if any of their allies are knocked unconscious, and if all current members of the team are knocked down the game will return to the last checkpoint. Information about enemies and objects in the world can be obtained by scanning them, and concept art for the entries can be added by finding hidden pages in the levels. The Rookie receives upgrades to their proton pack automatically over the course of the game, and by finding enough scanner entries they can increase their health.****Ghostbusters: The Video Game on the Wii and PS2 shares the same story, level settings, and most of the dialogue of the XBOX360/PS3/Windows version, but it also has several departures. Levels are condensed, redesigned, and occasionally completely removed. The art assets were changed to a cartoon-like style, and some bosses were redesigned as a result. While this version lacks an online mode, the Wii release does allow two players to play through story mode in co-op, something impossible in the high definition version. Finally the player has the option of playing a female Rookie, although this has no impact on the story (and some characters still refer to the Rookie as being male).

This is going to be one long night.****Lazarus starts the game with a pistol, but bullets aren't much use against the incorporeal. Eventually he will find energy weapons that can drain away a ghost's energy, and when a ghost has been sufficiently weakened it can be captured with Lazarus' homing ""Ghost Grenade"". Not all the monsters Lazarus faces are the undead, however, and more solid foes can be dispatched the traditional way: shooting them until they stop moving. Levels are traveled through sequentially and range from flooded bayous to a sunken battleship and abandoned prison island. Sometimes Lazarus will be assisted by a mute ghost named Astral who can reach areas beyond Lazarus and open paths for him. She has to be careful however as she has no way to attack or defend herself."

From the meek Smarties (who are employed to build your bases or eaten as a primary source of protein, depending on your species), to the cow-like vimps to the deadly rippers, the fauna of the planet will either try to kill you or avoid being killed/eaten/captured. While not so energetic, the floral of the islands can be crushed, knocked over, or burned in careless combat (or by Kabuto not paying attention). ****Game controls are similar to Shiny's MDK and can best be described a simplified shooter interface. You can run, jump, turn, shoot, and strafe. Beyond that, a half-dozen keystrokes are all you need to play (and some, like Kabuto's howls, are for fun and show). ****Trying to break away from the dark and moody nature of many recent games, Planet Moon made this alien world bright and full of vibrant colors. A great number of graphic options are available, most of them only will work on high-end video cards. In addition, the game tries to maintain a humorous streak. The single player game has goofy dialogue and a few jokes spread along its story line and even the multiplayer is lighthearted, with Smarties cheering you on as you carry them on your back, among other little sounds and nuances.

Gradius V (USA)>Gradius V>2004>ESRB - T (Teen)>Konami Corporation>Treasure>Shoot-'Em-Up>4.3>1-2 Players>Long ago, the Gradius army destroyed an evil life form that was threatening the galaxy. But somehow some of the Bacterian cells survived, and a new army has appeared ready to take over the galaxy! The Gradius forces have developed a super spatial-temporal fighter (called the Vic Viper) which you must pilot in order to destroy all of the enemies. The gameplay in Gradius V is an arcade style shooter and is very similar to the other games in the series. You need to guide the Vic Viper through a series of side scrolling screens and destroy the many enemies that appear (including several very large bosses). Although you begin the game with very limited firepower, additional weapons can be acquired. After destroying certain enemies, a power up capsule is left behind; collecting these will advance the weapon selector. When the weapon you want is selected after collecting enough capsules, you can activate it to equip the Vic Viper with that weapon. Your choices are speed up, missiles, double fire, lasers, multiples (these circle the Vic Viper providing additional firepower), and force fields. As you progress through the game, short animated cut scenes will reveal the story, and the enemies become tougher and more numerous. The game is somewhat customizable, allowing you to set the controls, difficulty level, and number of lives you begin with.

Any monsters present in these areas will be shown walking around. Walking over to and touching the monster in any way will activate a battle. If the monster notices the player approaching it is considered a normal battle, if Ryudo is able to approach undetected the player's party will gain the initiative in battle, if any party member besides Ryudo is approached by the enemy then the party loses initiative.****In battle, each character is able to choose from a list of actions that include ""attack combos"" (standard attack command), Special Abilities/Magic, ""Critical Strike"", Guard, Evade and Escape. Critical Strikes are weaker versions of attack combos with the advantage that they can block an enemy's action. This partly depends on the positions of the character on the action bar, displayed at the bottom of the screen, which shows each character (and enemy's) time to act within the battle.  Some magic spells and special abilities are also able to block enemy actions, though they take longer to perform than normal attacks. Both combo attacks and critical attacks require the attacker to run up to the enemy in order to perform the action. This depends heavily on the character's individual movement as well as other characters acting as obstacles on the screen.

Because gears had no will of their own and could only obey humans. Only one gear, named Justice, was able to transfer his will onto other gears and to rebel against the humans. In year 2180, Justice was killed as a result of a bloody tournament organized by the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. Yet recently, a new gear was discovered. He showed no signs of hostility, yet he had no master and was roaming about free. It was impossible to capture or to kill him because he was immensely strong.

The gameplay concept is similar to the game it is based on. About 60% of the included tracks are by Aerosmith, while the others have influenced or have opened for the band (Run-D.M.C., The Kings, Lenny Kravitz, ...). Four songs were re-recorded by the band directly for the game and they also performed as motion capture actors for their 3D models. The majority of the tracks consists of master recordings.****The prominent game segment is the career mode where players go through the band's history, from the earlier seventies to 2001. Times of internal issues are not touched upon. Players initially start as Joe Perry but can later also unlock the other band members Brad Whitford and Tom Hamilton. The career has been divided into six tiers with five tracks, each based on a period in the band's history. There are also encores when a tier has been completed, and two opening acts playing as another band. After each tier, bonus material is shown such as trivia or video sequences and interviews.****Songs are unlocked gradually and become available in the other modes, identical to Guitar Hero III (Quickplay, Cooperative, Competitive + Battle modes).

The storyline describes how a band wants to follow in the footsteps of the Metallica and become a leading act on their tour. This edition adds an Expert+ difficulty mode where players need to drum using a second bass pedal to mimic the playing style of Lars Ulrich, the drummer of the band. The members also did motion capture sessions for the avatars in the game.****The music selection consists of 28 master recordings and 21 additional songs by others selected by the band. Bonus features include various videos and trivia about the songs. Progress is made by completing sets of songs, rather than a series of gigs as in Guitar Hero: World Tour, set in venues that were in important in the band's career. Performances are rated with stars and a certain amount is needed to progress and unlock a new set.****The game also includes the GHTunes from World Tour where new songs can be created and shared. A new Drum Mode offers the possibility to play the drums without an existing drum track to create new rhythms, and the Battle mode (from Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock), has been updated with Metallica influences for the power-ups, with names like Fade To Black, Under The Ice and Ride The Lightning.****Although released in Europe packaged with a guitar controller and Metallica faceplate, other regions were not so fortunate and only received a solus edition.

Guitar Hero 5 (USA)>Guitar Hero 5>2009>ESRB - T (Teen)>Activision Publishing, Inc.>BudCat>Rhythm>3>1-4 Players>Guitar Hero 5 is the fifth main game in the musical rhythm series. Similar to the previous title, Guitar Hero: World Tour, the focus is on a band-experience, with a lead and bass guitar, drums and vocals. The title is available standalone or bundled with the instruments.****Next to a new soundtrack with 85 songs, many animated lead singers are now modelled after famous musicians such as Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Kurt Cobain, and Matthew Bellamy. Players can still compose their own songs in the included studio and the game relies heavily on downloadable content, through tracks and full albums. A portion of the songs of Guitar Hero: World Tour, Guitar Hero Smash Hits and Band Hero can be imported in exchange for a small fee per song.****In the Band Lobby players can assemble a party of local and remore players to form a band, play the Career mode or opt for Quickplay. Most of the competitive multiplayer modes are carried over from former versions, along with two new ones: Party Play (random song selection with the option to join and leave at will using any instrument) and RockFest, a band mode for up to four (local) or up to eight (online) players with a variety of submodes. The songs are divided in smaller portions and for each section the players are rewarded based on a variety of conditions.****General new features introduced to the gameplay include drop-in/drop-out play, where it is possible to join in the middle of a song or stop playing without interrupting gameplay. There is also a new Challenges section in the Career mode.****The different game versions are identical, except for the PS2 version that lacks online game modes and downloadable content, drop-in/drop-out play and song challenges. It is also limited to two instruments and the multitap is not supported. The Wii version is very similar to the major console versions, including downloadable content on SD cards, multiplayer through the global Wii address book, and the Mii Freestyle mode from the previous game. It also supports interaction with the Nintendo DS to edit videos and provides access to the Roadie Battle mode, similar to the main battle mode of Guitar Hero III, where players complete mini-games on the Nintendo DS to sabotage the players on the console.
Guitar Hero Encore - Rocks the 80s (USA)>Guitar Hero Encore - Rocks the 80s>2007>ESRB - T (Teen)>Activision Publishing, Inc.>Harmonix Music Systems>Rhythm>3.8>1-2 Players>Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s is an incremental title in the Guitar Hero series, using the features and gameplay from Guitar Hero II but with a completely new batch of songs. The game's theme is the eighties, reflected by the characters and their clothing, the venues and of course the songs themselves. It is the last title in the series developed by the original creators Harmonix Music Systems, Inc.****As in the previous games, in the single-player mode the player works his way through a setlist unlocking increasingly difficult songs, divided over 4 main difficulties. By performing well, new songs and venues become available, but there are less unlockables compared to the previous titles. Notable bands in this edition include A Flock of Seagulls, The Police, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Asia, Dio and Anthrax. Unlike the previous games, there are no bonus tracks.****The game is played through the guitar controller introduced for this series. The multi-player modes include Co-op, Face-off and Pro Face-off, identical to the previous game.
Guitar Hero II (USA)>Guitar Hero II>2006>ESRB - T (Teen)>Activision Publishing, Inc.>Harmonix Music Systems>Rhythm>3.9>1-2 Players>Guitar Hero II, the follow-up to the PS2-only game Guitar Hero, expands upon the gameplay and features of the original game. As a wannabe rockstar, you need to play songs by pressing combinations of five fret buttons on a guitar-shaped controller, while working the strum bar, along with an optional whammy bar for distortion. The sequel contains 64 songs, of which 40 have been licensed. One of the tracks was discovered through a contest at beaguitarhero.com, where unlicensed bands could send in a demo to be included in the game. Most of the tracks have been covered in-studio, but a few use original recordings.****The career mode has been revamped as a high school battle where you need to make your way to the top. Every venue is now represented by a different city. There are also encore performances, and unlockables can still be bought in the shop. A completely new addition is the practice mode (Shred School). When you keep getting stumped by a single track, you can train in this mode. The background music is dropped, you can choose a certain section to practice, and there four types of speeds available, to slowly get the hang of difficult passages.****In the multiplayer mode, you can still play the traditional mode from the first game, where sections are traded off between players.  The co-op mode is new: both players play the same song at the same time, but one is given the lead guitar, while the other handles the bass or rhythm guitar. Unlike the traditional mode, you can fail and both player share the score, rock meter and multiplier. To activate star power (a short power-up mode where the score multiplier is doubled, built up in a meter by playing a number of star-shaped notes without flaws and best saved for difficult sections) both players need to raise the guitar at the same time. You cannot practice together in this mode, but the different sections are available in the singleplayer practice mode. The final mode is called Face-Off. Here, both players play every single note at the same time. In the multiplayer mode, each player can now choose an individual difficulty level. Upon completing Face-Off, Pro Face-Off becomes available, where both players need to use the same difficulty level.****Other additions are the introduction of three-button chords, the use of hammer-ons and pull-offs (holding one note while playing another and vice versa) is smoother, and the screen now shakes if you break a note streak (only of the side of the player who makes the mistake in the multiplayer mode).
Guitar Hero III - Legends of Rock (USA)>Guitar Hero III - Legends of Rock>2007>ESRB - T (Teen)>Activision Publishing, Inc.>RedOctane>Rhythm>3.9>1-2 Players>Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is the third full game in the Guitar Hero series and fourth game overall. The gameplay remains similar to the previous games: using a guitar-shaped controller, you need to coordinate pressing the five fret buttons and strumming to the scrolling notes on screen. Missing notes will cause your performance meter to drop; if the meter drops too low then the performance is a failure and you will need to try again. This edition of the game features 71 new songs to play from various artists including Cream, The Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath, Aerosmith, Guns N' Roses, Santana, Sonic Youth, Weezer, and many more. In addition to the available songs the game also features &quot;boss battles&quot; against famous guitarists such as Slash, Tom Morello and Lou the Devil. Several game modes are available including career mode, co-op mode, and multiplayer mode. In addition to the main game modes, training and practice modes are available to aid in learning the game or figuring out a tricky passage in a song.****In career mode you play the part of a wanna-be rock star. Beginning with easier songs in small venues, you need to successfully complete tracks to make your way up to a superstar. Each venue you play requires a certain number of songs to be performed before you can move on to the next larger venue. Successful completion of songs also earns money which can be used to unlock characters, outfits, new guitars, and other bonuses.****The co-op career mode is similar to the single player variation, except two players work together (one on lead guitar, the other on bass or rhythm guitar) to complete songs. ****The multiplayer game modes allow two players to compete against each other. In the Face-Off variation, two players take turns performing a song. The Pro Face-Off variation allows two players to compete at the same time playing the exact same note chart. Finally, in the battle mode each player can earn power ups by performing well which can be used to disrupt the other player.
Guitar Hero World Tour (USA)>Guitar Hero World Tour>2008>ESRB - T (Teen)>Activision Publishing, Inc.>BudCat>Rhythm>2.7>1-4 Players>"Guitar Hero: World Tour is the fourth main game in the series and brings a major change to the concept. Following the release of Rock Band that built on the Guitar Hero concept but added additional instruments, World Tour introduces these as well to allow players to play together simultaneously as a real band. Next to the guitar that was the main peripheral for the previous titles, the bundled edition of the game adds a microphone for the vocal parts and drums for percussion. Just like the previous game, the guitar tracks are split up for the lead and bass. The lyrics and the vocal pitch is shown near the top of the screen, while the bottom part is split up for bass guitar, lead guitar and drums, each with a separate set of notes that need to be hit to correctly play the part.****While playing, a rock meter keeps track of successive notes hit (one for each player), which leads to score multipliers. When the meter becomes too low, other players can make up for this on a shared, general performance meter. In the same vein players share a star power meter, built up by playing through certain sections successfully, that any player can access.****There are four difficulty levels and a new beginner mode where notes are made as easy as possible to introduce the concept to new players. Most of the game content is centered around a Career mode (both Solo and Band) where players start a new band, choose an avatar an instrument, and then play different gigs unlocking new songs along the way. Completing tracks earns money that can be spent on outfits or instruments. There are once again encore songs and ""boss challenges"" where the lead guitar enters a duel. This is similar to the battles in Guitar Hero III, but without the power-ups. Instead it returns to a call-and-response mechanic similar to the Face-Off mode. Bands consists of offline players but online members can join as well. Complete bands can take on others online through the Battle of the Bands mode.****Through the Music Studio editor new songs can be composed and shared using the GHTunes service (not for the PS2). In this edition avatars can be customized with more detail using the Create-a-Rocker mode. Major artists have licensed their appearance in the game. The Wii version contains a Mii Freestyle mode where players can use their Mii characters in-game and compose songs through motions of the Wii remote and the Nunchuk controller.****There are several bundles for the game, based on the amount of instruments included, but also a stand-alone version as most of the versions are compatible with the controllers of previous games and even some of Rock Band."

Just before passing away, your father hands you a token and reveals you are not his son. Sworn to avenge his death, you pursue the killers and unravel the secrets surrounding the item. Although you are on your own, temporary alliances can be formed with townspeople, Apaches and posse members, but watch your back as they can turn against you.****The main storyline, written by Hollywood screenwriter Randall Jahnson (The Mask of Zorro, 1998,) is linear.

Harry Potter - Quidditch World Cup (USA)>Harry Potter - Quidditch World Cup>2003>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Electronic Arts, Inc.>Magic Pockets>Sports>3.5>1-2 Players>Quidditch, the broomstick and ball “sport” of the Harry Potter world comes to life in this simulation.  For those unfamiliar with the game, two seven player teams of flying wizards attempt to score goals with one ball while dodging more flying balls and each other.  For those who are familiar with the game, you will be happy to know that the players, positions, and “strategies” of Quidditch are faithfully recreated.****The game starts with a player selecting which of the four Hogwarts school teams he or she wishes to play for.  Following some tutorial events, they are launched into the competition for the Hogwarts Cup against the other three teams.  As the player wins games and completes specific challenges (such as “score 120 points in one game”) they collect Quidditch cards which unlock special combo moves.  Once a player has won the school championship, they can go on to play as one of nine international teams competing for the Quidditch World Cup each with it’s own style and special combo moves.  After winning the cup once, there are still more cards to be collected by playing and winning as different teams.****People familiar with actual sports know that the rules of Quidditch (as described in Rowlings' books) are fundamentally flawed and that the only meaningful part of the game is the 1 on 1 competition between the two seekers trying to catch the golden snitch.  Quidditch World Cup alleviates this problem with the “golden snitch bar”.  As the game progresses, completing action combos and performing special moves adds to a team progress bar.  Eventually, when the snitch appears, the team with better positioning on the bar will start with an advantage in the chase.  Ironically, this system rewards things other than actual scoring so in-game goals still remain mostly meaningless (except on lower difficulty levels where it is very easy to build a 160+ point lead and make the snitch inconsequential).****Because it is designed for younger audiences, Quidditch World Cup lacks most of the advanced features you would expect in an EA sports game (league play, team management, etc…).  It also lacks any multiplayer options other than two player (same machine) exhibition matches

Harry can also call a ghost which shows him the fastest way to the next mission. Exploration has mostly one goal: finding the 150 (more or less) hidden crests which unlock achievements and trophies. Because Harry lost his ability to jump and climb, he has to use spells to reach them.****Mini Games**The player will spend most of his time in three mini games: magic duels, brewing potions, and quidditch. The duels are used to learn new spells respectively improve the already known. Harry basically faces other magicians and uses his spells to defeat them, e.g. by paralyzing them or by parrying their spells. To perform a spell the player has to use his input device to recreate a certain movement.****Quidditch is a reaction test. Harry's broom flies automatically and the player can only slightly move it to fly through rings or avoid obstacles. While brewing potions Harry faces a bowl, ingredients and a time limit. Now he simply needs to recreate the receipt by using the ingredients in the correct on the bowl. Sometimes he needs to heat up the bowl or stir the brew up with his input device. If he makes a mistake there is smoke which costs time.

He left behind a huge bell - The Golden Voice - for his people to call him should they ever be in danger. During his absence however, the evil Lord Vetch invades the planet and enslaves Athellion's people by infecting them with a deadly virus. A virus, that requires a constant treatment with an antidote called catana. As the only one controlling the catana-support, Lord Vetch was easily able to force everyone to work for him.

Forgotten until Haven, one of the slaves, starts having dreams about a hill and a bell; dreams whose meaning he does not understand.

Despite all these action elements, there are also some slower paced levels, which put more emphasize on puzzle-solving and exploration.****Haven's conceptual artwork was done by Rodney Matthews, a fairly well-known English sci-fi/fantasy artist, which is evident in Haven's surrealistic, bizarre design.

The vaccine was found, but at the time the world was engulfed into chaos. A new world order emerged, splitting the world into two distinct yet dependent worlds: Above and Below.****The world Above reflects a chrome city, a high-rise, high-tech metropolis served by elevators and elevated freeways. A place for hardworkers and law-abiding people. On the contrary to Above, the world Below, which is the product of earthquake damages, is a subterranean network of labour colonies. Those who are not wanted Above for one reason or another are sent Below.****One day, now veteran Headhunter, Jack Wade, took a call to investigate an intrusion to the upper levels. Facing the trespasser, Jack saw a potential in the girl and instead of turning her in, he gave her a second chance... to become his apprentice. Jack is back, but this time, he's not alone but accompanied by his sidekick Leeza X. Together, they will face whatever threat lurks from the world Below.****The gameplay is set in 3rd-person view with ability to rotate camera or set it behind your back at the single click. Headhunter's main accessory is IRIS (Intelligent Realtime Information Scanner).

Also, IRIS will provide you with a full 3D map info even displaying the enemies so you can avoid them or use stealth if necessary. Enemies will hear you running and shooting, so if you decide to take an action, be aware that they will surround you and launch a team strike at you from all the sides. You only effective aid against them, beside your weapon, of course, is the ability to perform a roll or lean against the walls and fire from the corners, although aiming itself may not be easy as your hand will not be steady while on the move or panicking.

Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection.****Between levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination. Certain parts of the city are unavailable until you have gained the appropriate Headhunter license.****As you have no recollection of your past, you have to take a series of licenses that will grant you access to greater parts of the city, weaponry and gadgets. These are taken in a VR simulator known as the Law Enforcement Intelligence and Licence Approval (LEILA). At various times in the game you will need to go to the LEILA building and upgrade your licence by practising your combat, stealth and driving skills.****Jack will need to pass LEILA tests in order to grant him access to the equipment dispensers. He starts the game with a standard issue Stimulator Automatic, but can acquire grenades, proximity mines, neurostunners, decoy shells, shotguns and automatic weapons as he progresses. The weapons in the game fire Electric Neural Projectiles (ENP’s) instead of bullets. These cause brain death so as to preserve the internal organs of the person being shot.****Jack also uses a CASIO Visual Manager to keep in touch with Angela and his former chief at the ACN. This is a wristwatch with video capabilities and a direct link to the LEILA database.

Agent 47 can sneak around to remain undetected, and he can disguise himself in clothes from killed or stunned guards. ****The guards aren't completely stupid, however, as they will investigate suspicious noises, and they'll react if they see you waving around a gun. They'll get suspicious if they see you running around, raise alarm upon finding a corpse, and if you hang in a disguise around them too long, they'll eventually realize you're not one of their buddies. ****Hitman 2: Silent Assassin brings something new to the series: depending on your stealthiness, you are given a rating upon completing a mission. Going trigger-happy on everyone will result in being called a ""Mass Murderer"", while only the most patient and skilled players will manage to receive the ""Silent Assassin"" rating, which generally involves stealthily eliminating the target without raising any suspicion."

Homura (Europe)>Homura>2006>ESRB - E10+ (Everyone 10+)>Taito Corporation>Skonec>Shoot-'Em-Up>3.4>1 Player>"An evil fallen angel steals the Divine Crystal, one of Heaven's untouchable treasures. With this crystal he gains the power to control the thoughts of Shogun Ieyasu Tokugawa, and forces him to occupy Osaka castle and put himself in power using his newfound powers. In Heaven, the leaders of the individual heavenly families form a council with one aim... to regain the Divine Crystal. But they can't do this alone, so they decide to use the prisoner Homura to aid them. While they don't want to release him, he is the only one who's blood is half that of an angel and half human making him immune against the Crystal's powers. Homura refuses at first, but when he finds out that his mother was one of the victims at Osaka he picks up his sword and is ready to fight once again...  Homura is a top-down shoot'em up of the bullet-hell persuasion. The player takes on the role of Homura as he fights his way through 4 levels filled with demons. Each stage has a branching path where Homura can pick which route to take. The paths will meet up at the end of the stage however, so the boss fight will always be the same.  There are several ways to dispose of the enemies in the game, where the common one is a projectile attack (as it the norm of the genre). What sets this game apart is Homura's sword slash technique; When used it makes the enemies' bullets bounce back towards them. The more bullets are slashed at once, the higher the score multiplier will be. The sword slash has to be recharged for a few seconds each time after use. There are also powerful special attacks which will clear the screen of all enemies or do massive damage to bosses.  Killed enemies drop money, which is used to fill up a meter. When the meter is full, an ""option"" helper is added to Homura's side adding additional fire power.  The aspect ratio can be changed in the options menu in a multitude of ways, one of which means placing the screen sideways (for standing the TV on its side) to make it more similar to the original arcade cabinet's setup.  There is also an unlockable art gallery which will have more pictures added to it the further the player makes it through the game."

On top of that Atombender has an entire army of robots patrolling the base. If a robot touches or shocks the agent then ten minutes are removed from the clock and the room is reset.

The player can select one of three agents, although all of them possess the same abilities. Robots are now color coded according to what they are capable of doing (yellow only patrol, red patrol and shock, blue can follow and shock), but some aspects of each robot's personality can still only be figured out by watching or approaching them. Finally an easy mode has been added that adds an extra two hours to the clock and marks rooms which you have cleared out of items.

Katamari Damacy (USA)>Katamari Damacy>2004>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Namco Limited>Now Production>Action>4>1-2 Players>The King of All Cosmos accidentally destroyed the stars and—having recovered—wants the prince to rebuild them.  Unfortunately the prince stands a little less than half a foot tall, so recreating the stars will require some effort.  Enter the Katamari, a sphere the prince can push around our world to “roll up” items increasing the Katamari’s size until it’s suitable for the King.****Taking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it.  At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect.  Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items.  Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items.****Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2.  A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos.  Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamari’s size and sets time limits on the level.  Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions.  ****The world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack.  Players can find presents hidden in the levels that contain accessories for the prince.  Two players can also battle head-to-head in a Katamari competition.

This year's tournament is sponsored by the Ikari Warriors in an attempt to discover more about the NESTS organization, and to derail the plans of potential NESTS agents K' and Maxima. Not everything is as straight-forward as it usually is, however, and even the Ikari Warriors themselves are at risk of being betrayed from within by the end of the tournament.****The King of Fighters 2000 features a roster of 34 fighters plus 2 unlockable boss characters. The four-man teams and the striker system introduced during the previous year return in this year's tournament, with the striker system itself receiving significant improvement. One change in particular is the ""alternate"" striker system, where every fighter in the game now has another character linked to him or her that may be chosen instead of the normal character for striking purposes. For example, one may elect to use Iori Yagami's alternate striker instead of using Iori himself; in his case, the player could elect to choose and use his old teammates Mature and Vice for striker duty instead. Some characters also have hidden ""maniac"" striker with strange (but potentially useful) abilities."

Counting the new characters (May Lee, Angel, K9999, Original Zero, Igniz) and returning fighters (such as Heidern and Goro Daimon), The King of Fighters 2001 has 40 normal characters and 2 boss characters to choose from. In terms of gameplay, the system used in The King of Fighters 2000 remains more or less unchanged with the exception of the striker system, which has been redeveloped since that last KOF release. The number of strikers you may have is now fully customizable; you can have as many as 3 characters assigned as strikers and one as a fighter, or assign all 4 of your characters as active fighters. The number of strikers and fighters can be changed after each battle.

This game's storyline focuses on the unexpected return of the Orochi power, who was thought to have been permenantly sealed away back in 1997 by Kyo Kusanagi, Iori Yagami and Chizuru Kagura. It appears that someone has been tampering with the seal, however...****This year there are 30 characters, 2 edit characters (Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami) and 2 hidden characters (Kusanagi from KOF '02 and Chizuru Kagura) to choose from. There are several returning characters (Jhun Hoon, King, Shingo Yabuki, Hinako Shijou, Billy Kane and Ryuji Yamazaki) and few new fighters as well (Ash Crimson, Shen Woo, Duo Lon, Malin, Adelheid Bernstein and Mukai).****Like The King of Fighters 2002, this game reverts back to the old 3-on-3 format used from KOF '94 to KOF '98. A new feature to this game that old-school KOF fans might have trouble getting used to is the new interchangeable team system. You still pick three characters and decide your character order before a match, but now you have the option to change to another character during a match. For example, if your character is low on power during a match, you can have either one of the other two characters at your disposal step in and take their place. It also works if you do not like the character that you have selected, or if you are having trouble using that character. You can change at any time during a match, but you cannot when two of your teammates have been taken out, and only one character is left in reserve.

In total, this allows a player to choose between +40 characters.

However, the change in the arcade hardware has brought about many gameplay changes since the 2003 release. A new power stock system - specifically called ""Skill Stocks"" - has been added for use with a few extra special maneuvers called ""Shifts"". A character can use a ""Quick Shift"" to tag in another fighter while in the middle of a combo, while that character may also use a ""Saving Shift"" to tag out if they are on the verge of defeat. Another maneuver, called the ""Dream Cancel"", has also been added to the system. Dream Cancels can be used to interrupt a special move with another one, even allowing a fighter to interrupt a Desperation Move to initiate a Leader Desperation Move. The ""Time Out"" system has be revamped as well - the system now takes into account the number of fighters defeated on a team and the number and power of attacks made by a team to reach its verdict."

The story begins when the hero gets a visit from a mysterious stranger.  The stranger gives the hero an idol and then vanishes.  At once the hero recognizes the idol as the ""Idol of Sorrow"" and goes to the land of despair to learn more about it.  Shortly before the hero arrives in this land though, a small force led by the prince attempted to reclaim the land again, but most of the men have disappeared.  Seek out the forest folk, as legend says they were the creators of the idol and will hopefully know how to remove the curse that is on it.****King's Field is a first-person role-playing game that utilizes both melee and ranged weapons, as well as different magic spells.  During gameplay expect to run into many monsters, puzzles, NPCs, and traps.  You'll use the items you collect throughout the game in various places later on.  A new and different keystone system is used in this iteration of the series where you can only teleport to designated key stones when near a teleportation circle.  Search the runes and discover the story behind the idol."
Kingdom Hearts (USA)>Kingdom Hearts>2002>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Square Co., Ltd.>SquareSoft>Role-Playing>4>1 Player>Sora's world is shattered when a violent storm hits his home, and he is separated from his two closest friends. The storm scatters the three to unknown worlds. At the same time, there is turmoil in the Disney Castle. King Mickey is missing, and Court Wizard Donald and Captain Goofy are out to find him. On their travels they meet Sora, on his own search for his lost friends. The three are told of ominous creatures called Heartless, being without hearts derived from an unknown dimension and are the ones responsible for the devastating storm. ****The Disney villains, enticed by the power of darkness, manipulate the Darkness to help them gather the princesses of heart, who are needed to open a mysterious final door. Upon discovering the link between the Heartless, the storm, and the disappearance of King Mickey, Sora, Donald, and Goofy join forces and help familiar Disney heroes to save their worlds from the Heartless.****In Kingdom Hearts players step into the very large shoes of Sora, wielder of the keyblade. Sora can attack with the blade, and as he levels up he will gain more attacks that are automatically chained together. Sora can learn magic and put healing items into a quick menu, and both can only be used in real time. Donald and Goofy (as well as an additional character exclusive to each world/disney movie) will follow Sora. Their equipment and AI can be adjusted, but they can not be directly controlled. Defeated enemies will drop many kinds of items including synthesis materials. Sora can take these to the Synthesis shop in Twilight Town to turn them into usable items, accessories, and weapons.****Traveling between each world requires Sora's party to fly through space in a Gummi Ship. The Gummi Ship can be completely customized, from speed and armor to weapons and shape, out of parts picked up from destroyed Gummi Ships, found in worlds, or bought from a store. Larger, more complex ships can be built as the game progresses, and plans can be found from destroyed enemies or from an NPC that will automatically build a Gummi Ship of specific specifications.
Kingdom Hearts II (USA)>Kingdom Hearts II>2006>ESRB - E10+ (Everyone 10+)>Square Co., Ltd.>Square Enix>Role-Playing>3.8>1 Player>"Sora, Donald, and Goofy are back in the third installment (second for PS2) of the Kingdom Hearts series, continuing where Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories left off. The trio awakens from their sleep and goes to Twilight Town. When the game begins, you will first have control over a boy name Roxas who wields a dual-Keyblade. He is trying to enjoy the remainder of his summer vacation with his friends but he keeps having flash-backs of someone else's memories.****When he meets up with Sora, the two learns they have a special connection with one another. Afterwards, the group will continue their search for King Mickey and Riku. This time, they will travel to new worlds and work with various characters from the Disney and Final Fantasy universes. This includes worlds from not only Disney's animated movies but other movies as well like Pirates of the Caribbean and TRON.****In Kingdom Hearts II, Sora and his friends will battle various enemies including the Heartless from Kingdom Hearts, but also a group of enemies called Nobodies. Nobodies are ""nonexistent beings"" who are under the control of Organization XIII - a group of 13  members in black coats that Sora and his friends have reduced down to just half.  ****Gameplay is very similar to Kingdom Hearts: the player controls Sora with Donald and Goofy helping with their magic and attacks. Sora can use various magic powers as well as use Summon which will call upon the aid of special Disney characters that will temporarily fight alongside him. A new feature of combat are ""Reaction Commands"". Some enemies will leave themselves open during attacks, and if the player presses the Reaction Command button when prompted Sora will take advantage of the situation, either turning an enemy's attack against them, striking from a defenseless side for extra damage, or avoiding an otherwise unavoidable attack. As the trio levels up and progresses in the game they will gain new abilities that they can equip.  Also, after Mickey meets the party, if Sora is KO'd the player will have the option of controlling Mickey and defending Sora until he can recover.****Another new feature is the Drive gauge. When filled and activated Sora absorbs the strength of his allies and gains new powers, like long range magical bullets in Magician form or the ability to use two keyblades in Strength form. Using Drive forms will power them up, unlocking new abilities and allowing them to be used for longer periods of time.****The Gummi Ship returns, but the speed of combat during Gummi Ship level has been greatly increased. While the path of the Gummi Ship is still out of the player's control, the ship can now attack enemies to the front, sides, and behind. Gummi Ship levels can be re-challenged at different difficulty levels, with different levels offering greater challenge and new enemy patterns. Achieving high scores in these levels rewards new Gummi Ship parts and plans."

It was initially released as a part of Kingdom Hearts II: Final Mix+ and only later made available as a standalone game.****The most important change is that the world and battles are now in full 3d, including voice acting and a full soundtrack. Basic gameplay elements such as the battle system based on cards remain identical, but with additions such as the Reaction Command from Kingdom Hearts II. There are also a number of new cutscenes and entirely new battles, such as the fight with Zexion in Reverse/Rebirth.

By ringing the four bells across the land, Klonoa can restore harmony, but the Sky Pirate Leorina is in hot pursuit, after Klonoa's magic ring...****Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil is a 3D side-scrolling platformer.  The main goal of the game is to get to the end of each level (or 'Vision'), but there are also special goals to achieve.  Firstly, each Vision contains six Momett Dolls hidden in each level.  Secondly, there are Dream Stones scattered throughout each level - green ones are worth one, while blue ones are worth five.  Certain puzzles also contain tricky use of the ""Dream Spirit"", which doubles the value of all collected Dream Stones.  New to Klonoa 2 are hoverboard sections, which play at a faster, more action-oriented pace.****But what makes Klonoa unique is his abilities.  Klonoa can shoot a 'wind bullet' into foes, which puffs them up and allows Klonoa to carry them.  Klonoa can then launch them straight at foes, or jump with them, giving him an extra boost.  If he needs extra length to his jump, holding the jump button will allow him to hover for a little longer, too.  Different enemies have different effects - for example, certain foes have propellers on their heads and will rocket you into the sky, while others will act like time bombs and explode after a short while."

Together with Michael Knight, you have to fight crime in 10 missions and 15 races.****Many original ideas from the TV series have been included in the game. KITT, Michael, Bonnie and Devon are all in the game, as are the evil Garth and KARR. The player can also use various original functions of the car, like Turbo Boost, Super Pursuit Mode, Ski Mode or the famous Scanner, whose sound everyone should recognise.****The game can only be played in campaign mode, where KITT and Michael have to solve a mysterious case, starting out as a simple bank robbery.

There is also turbo boost to jump over obstacles, micro jam to scan items and recharge, the ski mode to drive on two wheels through narrow passages, super pursuit mode for faster speed, and a shield to block incoming attacks. When damaged or running low on energy, certain functions are disabled.****The different missions are linked by sequences where the story is further explained using the in-game engine. Many familiar characters from the tv series make an appearance, such as Bonnie, Devon, Garth and KARR. Missions either focus on racing or exploration. In the first type, the player mainly evades attacks while racing on a highway. The latter has the player drive inside closed areas, maneuvering through passages and fighting robots. There are also a few puzzle elements where the player has to locate terminals, shoot an object in the environment, or find enemies' weaknesses. When a stunt is performed, the action slows down and the camera switches to a spectacular angle.****Next to the main story mode, the individual missions can be replayed in the mission mode. The player can also unlock TV scenes, view background information about the series, or do a quiz.

At the start of the game you can choose 1 out of 3 locations to visit. Advancing in the game will unlock new locations. Each location is either a city or town where you can advance in the primary mission, obtain sub-quests, trade, meet people, etc. or it could be a dungeon type location crawling with monsters. Often its a little combination of both.****Most of the gameplay (when not exploring cities) revolve around combat and character development. Combat consists of 3D 3rd Person Perspective point of view where you can attack enemies using various skills, abilities and attack combo's. Each of which can be upgraded at any point of the game by spending experience points to the pointed skill, ability or combo.****On character development, there are 3 major areas that may be upgraded: (1) Knightly Abilities; Spiritually oriented gifts of the Templar knight: from healing to other holy abilities. (2) Skill Abilities; These are usually attack-based skills. Various attacking styles to soften and defeat both men and monster. (3) Combo's. The extension of the ""attack button"". Upgrading the combo section provides additional attack moves.****Combat also is uniquely divided into 3 different weapons. The first is the standard Sword and Shield, providing high defense and standard attack, useful in defensive stances and vs. ranged enemies; The second is the 2-handed weapon, primary for direct damage in close-combat against single or multiple enemies; The third is ranged combat using a crossbow. The perspective in ranged combat diverts to 1st person perspective (though you can still see your head). ****During the course of the game, you can obtain additional weapons and armor (as well as other items), either from the course of a sub-quest or purchasing it from a local trader."

Le Tour de France - Centenary Edition (Europe)>Le Tour de France - Centenary Edition>2003>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Konami of Europe GmbH>DC Studios>Sports/Biking>3.2>1-2 Players>While games of the Pro Cycling Manager series attempt to recreate the feeling of being a Pro/Continental Tour cycling team manager, Tour de France: Centenary Edition is all about providing the thrills of being a cyclist, starting from the end of the peloton and making way to get a chance at victory. The game is licensed by the Tour de France, and features many real teams and cyclists in six stages, some of which available in reverse mode. Due to the nature of the name, this changes drastically the nature of the tracks - what can be a perfect track for climbers becomes one for the technical riders (with good breaking and turning abilities) in reverse.  While the game provides a much simplified arcade experience, it plays a lot differently from games featuring motor vehicles. The player has a limited stamina bar, which decreases as the player goes faster to break away from the current group or pedals harder to beat a steeper hill. In order to replenish it, he can drink a limited number of water-bottles, use down slope sections or, the key to a successful stage, use opponents' and team-mates slipstreams. However, this is not all without risks - down slope sections can be tricky due to the enormous speeds, and colliding takes stamina as well as time (and eventually, might force a retirement), and slipstreams are not always available or big enough. As cycling is also a team sport, the player can request a team-mate to slipstream him during a break, or to give him additional water bottles. They are also easier to slipstream, as they won't break away if the player close too long. Also playing a huge part on the race is the weather - rain makes pedalling much harder and increase the breaking distance noticeably, while fog reduces stamina loss, but players must be careful not to overdo speed due to limited viewing distance.  Game modes include training, arcade, time trials and the Tour de France, a career mode where the player can start a 5-year plan to become the world's number one cyclist by winning local races, which allows to afford better bike parts and training sessions. Parts affect mostly how well the player controls the bike, but as the game simulates the stage until the final miles, the starting position in the peloton is defined by the training, so a player who has a top bike but neglected training will struggle to perform well in the Tour de France, as instead of starting in the top 40 will start in 80th or even worse, losing precious time and both sprint and mountain points in the process.
Le Tour de France (Europe)>Le Tour de France>2002>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Konami of Europe GmbH>Konami>Driving>2.8>1-2 Players>Tour de France is an arcade racing game based on the premier road cycling event in the world.

As the player is controlling a bike, it isn't just a matter of pressing down the throttle button and avoid other competitors while keeping the best possible trajectory. While the last two are still as important, the player must pace according to the stamina of the racer. While it can be partially replenished using water bottles, to win races the player must use downward slopes to gain velocity while still recovering stamina as well as taking advantage of the slipstream of other riders. While losing all stamina won't immediately abort the race, the rider will stop and put a feet down until it recovers to an acceptable level, making any chance of a good result impossible. The race will stop, however, once the damage (sustained by hitting other riders of fences at high speeds) is greater than half of the stamina bar.  It was followed by Tour de France: Centenary Edition.

Separated by sudden events, Raziel was forced to retreat into the spectral realm, leaving Kain to escape from the Serafan on his own. Both must escape the predicament they find themselves in and fight back against those who would seek to use them as manipulations in a grander plot. From both heroes cry out shouts of defiance, and a thirst to find the revelations that have been buried in the world of Nosgoth.****Legacy of Kain: Defiance is a 3rd person action-adventure game, combining concepts seen in both Blood Omen 2 and Soul Reaver 2. The story unfolds through chapters, focusing alternately on Kain and Raziel as they pursue their separate, though intertwined  quests. Control of each character alternates between levels, however both are controlled from a behind-the-shoulder perspective. While both heroes are different, they are similar in movement, ability to attack, defend, jump and access special abilities. Kain and Raziel no longer pick up weapons, instead both using a form of the Soul Reaver weapon (Kain uses the physical sword form, Raziel uses an energy blade). Each Soul Reaver can now be ""charged"" to unleash a special ability, determined by the current alignment of Soul Reaver at the time. Both Kain and Raziel lose energy at a constant rate and must feed to replenish life energy (Kain feeds on the blood of living creatures,  Raziel feeds on the souls of living and non-living creatures). And both Kain and Raziel feature telekinetic abilities to manipulate objects at a distance. ****Kain and Raziel are different characters however, that play differently, each requiring use of his talents,to bypass obstacles (sometimes the same obstacle). Kain focuses on strong combat and destructive abilities. He is able able to power up the Soul Reaver weapon using properties of the Pillars of Nosgoth. Raziel is more subtle, able to use stealth and the phasing between material and spectral worlds in order to discover new paths. As in Soul Reaver, Raziel can phase into the spectral world at any time but must find a special location in order to phase back. Raziel powers up the Soul Reaver using elemental powers."

It starts when Spyro and Cynder are freed from their crystalline prison. They are former foes, but the Dark Master binds them through green energy chains. After escaping their prison with Sparx and Hunter, they are shown what the Dark Master has done after he escaped from the Well of Souls during the Night of Eternal Darkness. They travel through Dragon City, the Burned Lands and the Floating Islands to confront Malefor at his lair.

Gems include blue ones to upgrade moves, red ones restore health, and green ones make available element attacks through dragon magic. The amount of blue ones provided is based on a melee combo system.  Fury gems have been removed. They are replaced with dark crystals that need to be destroyed as they drain magic. Fury is now determined through a meter that fills up during attacks. Next to the regular enemies there are now elite enemies that were a mask with a certain colour. A specific attack is needed to get rid off the mask and then regular attacks become effective.

LEGO Batman - The Videogame (USA)>LEGO Batman - The Videogame>2008>ESRB - E10+ (Everyone 10+)>Tt Games Publishing Ltd.>Traveller's Tales>Action>4.1>1-2 Players>Continuing the tradition of adapting known franchises such as Star Wars and Indiana Jones with visuals based on LEGO, this game takes on the Batman universe. The basic concept is the same, with characters and objects built up using LEGO blocks, but here shown against surroundings drawn in a regular fashion. Most of the environments are side-scrolling with a fixed camera perspective, but in 3D with quite some depth. ****It is not based on a certain movie or comic, but on the franchise as a whole with a new story. The animations and sequences are rather quirky and share nothing with the darker atmosphere of the contemporary Batman movies. A cast of villains has escaped from Arkham Asylum and now roam through Gotham City wreaking havoc. The first half of the game, players control Batman and his sidekick Robin to take on all enemies with typical brawler gameplay. Enemies will often respawn endlessly until the player figures out how to progress. The environments can be explored using a number of gadgets such as the batarang and the grappling hook, and players can switch between the two characters at any time. They can both fight and the inactive character is always controlled by the computer AI. Both characters have unique powers they can access by changing their suits. Batman can then glide through the air or plant bombs, while Robin has for instance a technology suit that allows his to walk on metal surfaces in any direction. They can also drive certain vehicles.****Both characters operate out of the Batcave that acts as a central hub to store trophies and access missions. Many of the missions have small puzzle elements with buttons or passages that need to be cleared. Objects and characters explode into smaller LEGO blocks and at certain sections the hero need to build structures with blocks to create new objects. After completing a mission in the story mode, it becomes available in a separate free play mode.****In the second part of the game players take control of the different villains such as Poison Ivy, The Joker, Mr Freeze, The Riddler, Killer Moth, Hush, Clayface, Man-Bat and more. They all have different powers and their section of the game always ends at the moment they are confronted by Batman and Robin. This way, the game shows how they set up their plans prior to the fights in the first part of the game. The characters collect coins, objects and hearts. Even though they can die, they immediately respawn.****Multi player options vary between platforms. Home console and Windows versions allow drop in/drop out co-op. The PSP release fares worst of all and does not contain any kind of multiplayer option.

While Indiana Jones has a whip with which he can pull items out of reach, the female characters can jump higher, scholars can decipher hieroglyphics, mechanics can fix machines and diggers can unearth buried treasure. The characters also have different phobias (snakes, rats, spiders), each corresponding to their personalities.****The main campaign of the game is called Story Mode in which the player follows the film's stories with two pre-defined characters and cut-scenes. Once the level has been cleared, however, the player can return in Free Play mode and switch between all the characters that have been unlocked, allowing access to previously unreachable areas to collect all other artifacts and bonus items.****Destroying or building objects produces Lego studs, which allows the player to buy additional characters and cheat modes in Barnett College (the main hub). Players can also watch previous cut-scenes, examine previously found treasures, enter codes, or explore the college at their leisure.****As in the LEGO Star Wars series, in addition to the single-player game, there is also a 2 player co-op mode that allows two players to play the Story Mode. The second player can enter the game at any given time by pressing a button on the second controller."

In Story Mode, players reenact the original movies with LEGOs.  Each character has different weapons, like light-sabers for Jedi's, and crossbows for Wookies, as well as new character-specific attacks and maneuvers.

The heart of the game is the franchise mode where the player can play whole seasons with its hundreds of matches and a managerial part. Besides keeping the balance, there are three main activities in this part: studying extensive statistics, player trading and hiring players through free agents. The latter is similar to other sports games: every player has other wishes for his team, e.g. athletic success. If the player's club can fulfill these wishes better the club has to pay less salary. Trading however is handled differently: Every club gives a value to the players on the roster. This value influences how the trading plays out. Training is another important part to consider.****Matches can either be simulated or played manually. Every part of the match has its own control scheme: For pitching the player uses two parts of his input device: the first for aiming and the second to recreate a movement (depending on the used move). Batting is done by swinging the bat in the right timing. He can also influence the ball's direction in the way he hits it. During fielding the player basically tells the controlled player the direction in which he should throw the ball. **Besides the franchise mode the player can participate in training, Home Run Derby and Postseason mode (play-offs). Players can unlock training cards.****The are a few small differences between the versions: on the Wii the player controls batting and pitching directly with the remote and the nunchuck and the PSP version features slightly different fielding controls. In the franchise mode the player can manage up to four franchises in the PS2 version and there is a farming system on PSP.

If a player fails to complete these tasks they will have to stay behind and also the story will change depending on who the player chooses to work with during these quests.****The game still features RPG-style elements, but now with different features.  Instead of ""leveling up"" by defeating enemies where the player can choose how there character will develop using a ""crafting"" system, letting them choose which attributes they want to modify.  Players can also ""craft""  items and weapons using various objects scattered throughout the world.****Players will no longer have random engagements, something more common in many RPGs, this time around the player can choose who or what they want to fight with the ability to see your opponents symbols on the board, choosing if they want to engage them."

Manhunt (USA)>Manhunt>2003>ESRB - M (Mature)>Rockstar Games, Inc.>Rockstar North>Action>3.8>1 Player>"Manhunt casts you as James Earl Cash, a prisoner on death row.  You are led down a corridor where you are about to receive a lethal injection.  The needle goes in.  You wake up hours later.  A mysterious voice tells you to stick in the nearby earpiece, and explains that the ""lethal"" injection was just a heavy sedative.  The man, later identified as Starkweather, turns out to be a director of snuff movies, where the people are really killed.  He explains that if you follow his directions, manage to kill people and survive, you'll earn your freedom.  This begins James Earl Cash's journey.****Throughout the course of the game, you'll have to make your way through different locales, such as a city and a mall, while killing gangs.  You'll face lots of different gangs, from The Hoods and The Skins to tougher gangs like The Innocenz.  Gang members carry weapons ranging from pistols and shotguns to knives and glass shards.****Manhunt is primarily a stealth game.  You'll have to hide behind walls, flatten yourself against walls, crouch, hide behind objects, and walk to avoid attracting attention.  You can also throw glass bottles to create a distraction, or you can punch surfaces and yell to get gangs to come to you.****You have a variety of weapons at your disposal, from the traditional, such as the shotgun and uzi, to the disgusting, such as a sickle and plastic bag.  Each weapon has three different ways of attacking, depending on how long you hold the button.  A quick attack will do the job, a medium attack will be bloody, but a high attack, requiring the longest amount of time, will earn you the most points, and will allow you to see your kill in a cinematic style, with blood splatting on the camera, and gurgling noises.****Manhunt also lets you use a USB headset, such as the one that came included with SOCOM: U.S. Navy Seals.  With the headset, you will hear Starkweather speak into your ears instead of through your speakers, and you will be able to shout into the microphone to attract gangs instead of pressing a button."
Manhunt 2 (USA)>Manhunt 2>2007>ESRB - M (Mature)>Rockstar Games, Inc.>Rockstar London>Action>3.3>1 Player>Manhunt 2 does not build upon the story and events of the first game. Instead, the same game mechanics are transferred to a new location, the Dixmor Insane Asylum, where the staff prefers to beat up the patients and experiment on them, rather than to offer treatment for their illness. One day a power outage allows the patients to revolt and bring mayhem to the asylum. The player gets the chance to play two roles: as Dr. Daniel Lamb and Leo Kasper. Although the beginning is set inside the asylum, the action soon moves to other locations.****The game mechanics are largely stealth oriented, while later levels offer more of a regular third-person shooter feel when more firearms become available. Gunplay requires extensive use of cover, maneuvers and sometimes stealth for success. There is a radar system, enemies have different levels of awareness and kills are best performed from the shadows. Players can throw objects to distract enemies or make noises into the USB headset to lure them away from their friends (PS2). To hide in the dark a quick mini-game needs to be performed. If it is not completed in time, the character's location will be revealed at once.****As in the first game players can perform executions, with three styles: Hasty (white), Violent (yellow) and Gruesome (red). These feature explicit violence including strangling, beatings, gun violence, setting them on fire and more. Some of these kills are however censored with blacked out scenes or the camera turning away. In the Wii version player need to mimic the motions needed for a kill with the combination of the Wiimote and the Nunchuk.****All versions are quite similar. The Wii edition includes three exclusive weapons (bottle, mace and a razor), while the other two versions have a weapon not found in the Wii game: a samurai sword. The Wii version is also the only one to include a short tutorial to familiarize the player with the controls. Other small changes in the Wii edition include more detailed environments, additional dialogue, new hunters (Sexual Deviants scene), some changes in weapon placement, a new manhole execution (in Ghosts), and more animations for Daniel and Leo, especially in close combat.

In the oppressed city of New Radius, you need to establish your name as an artist by laying down tags, burners and full pieces, but rival crews and law enforcement (Civil Conduct Keepers) are always on your tail. You will also uncover a conspiracy that plagues the city.****The game is story-driven with linear level progression. Most missions have platform elements and require you to lay art, varying from tags and stickers to complex pieces with full color, lettering and characters, on often difficult to reach surfaces. As it is not a friendly environment, Trane can deliver a host of punch and kick combos, use grabs, humiliate other artists, and interact with the surroundings. Your art arsenal includes markers, brushes, cans and rollers. All available pieces are kept in your black book, and new styles are unlocked while playing.****The title refers to working your way up the scene, as well as the ""Get In, Get Up, and Get Out"" principle - you need to gain access to restricted areas, get up on tall objects where your work can be seen, and get out afterwards without being caught. Good spots can be tracked using Intuition, and appear as coloured clouds.****The game is conceived by clothing impresario Marc Ecko, founder of the suburban designer label Ecko and is intended to pay tribute to graffiti culture and its history. Artists such as Cope2, Futura and Seen contributed art to the game."

Mix and match your choice of Marvel superheroes, in teams of four as you travel across the Marvel Universe to stop this threat. Certain teams such as The Fantastic Four and The New Avengers provide additional bonuses.****Some heroes must be unlocked first. The game also features RPG elements, such as leveling up. When a hero gains a level, they earn points you can use to upgrade their skills. You also collect Shield Coins, which can be spent on boosts for your hero team. ****You explore various legendary Marvel locales, from Asgard, to Prince Namor's Atlantis, where you take on foes with punches, kicks and super powers. Super powers drain energy, however, so use them wisely. Combos can be achieved by combining super powers. Energy is restored by collecting blue orbs from fallen foes. ****Boss battles are like the comics themselves: titanic battles that often not only test brawn but your brain as well. With over 20 playable heroes plus all the cameos, there are over 100 heroes and villains.****The game modes feature either single player, co-op, or online play. In general, Marvel Ultimate Alliance's gameplay can be considered an improved version of 2004's X-Men: Legends. The different versions are fairly identical. The PSP release has three more game modes, while Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 have additional levels.
Marvel - Ultimate Alliance 2 (USA)>Marvel - Ultimate Alliance 2>2009>ESRB - T (Teen)>Activision Publishing, Inc.>n - Space>Role-Playing>3.3>1-2 Players>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 continues the four-player mayhem of the previous Marvel Ultimate Alliance and, before that, the X-Men Legends series It is based on the Secret War and Civil War storylines from the comics. After Nick Fury leads an unauthorized super-hero assault on Latveria and a fight gone wrong kills hundreds of civilians in Connecticut, the government passes the super-human registration act, which requires all super-powered individuals to reveal their identities to the government. At one point in the story, you have to choose the pro or anti registration side and certain heroes will always be on one side or another, locking them out if you choose the other path. The game after this point changes depending on the storyline you choose.****You start with a handful of characters and can unlock more by completing bonus simulator missions, which will give you a special task like blowing up cars. There are four heroes active at all times during the game, unless they get knocked out. Each character has a health meter and a stamina meter. You can use SHIELD access points, usually at the beginning and middle of each level, to switch out characters. The stamina meter recharges on its own and controls use of powers. Each hero has a jump (which can also be used to double-jump, fly or web-swing, depending on the character), grab, quick strike and powerful strike. These can be used in combination to do things like jumping attacks, pick up an enemy, then punch them, etc. Combining these with a modifier button allows you to use powers. Each hero has a wide variety of powers. Leveling up gives you points to spend on improving the powers. You can re-assign the points and change which powers are active at any time.****Defeating enemies and smashing environment items gives you health refills and points that can be spent upgrading statistics for each hero. There are also items that you can carry that will give stat bonuses like increased HP or a bonus to a specific type of damage.****The big change over the previous game is the addition of fusions, which are two-character team-up attacks. This is controlled by a meter of four stars. You fill this by defeating enemies or finding an item that instantly fills the whole meter. You can spend one star to revive a fallen teammate or all four to perform a fusion attack. Any possible combination of two characters has their own unique fusion. There are three basic types:****There are targeted fusions, like having Things throw Mr. Fantastic at someone. These do high damage to a single target and are good for using on bosses. There are also clearing fusions, like having Storm bounce her lighting off Wolverine. These damage all enemies in a given radius. Clearing fusions are good for clearing out a clump of enemies. Finally, there are guided fusions, like Iceman and Human Torch shooting their powers at each other, then running around mowing down anyone who gets between them. These are good for clearing out scattered enemies.

On 13 tracks (which must be played free in single-player first) you need all your driving skills to survive and make it to the finish as the 1st with one of the four different cars available (from slow ones to really fast ones).****The heart of the single-player mode (besides the quick battle against the AI) are the bronze, silver and gold challenges for every track you need to complete to play free the next track. Each challenge is one of the seven (eight in multiplayer) game modes available in Mashed. From normal race-events (just be the 1st) over battles where you need to kill all your enemies before they do to the ultimate survival mode where everyone doesn't really like you.****To make things much easier there are nine different power-ups and weapons scattered on the tracks which you can pick up. From simple oil slicks over mines to deadly mortars there's everything you need to kick the enemy drivers out of the race. Of course they can also choose from the equipment. As you can only survive a few hits you need to make sure they can't use them on you. And to make it even worse there are many small passages (or the track is just one small passage...) with nothing on one or both sides of the track in which you or your enemy can fall very deep.****But the real heart of Mashed is the split-screen multiplayer mode which you can play with up to four players on one PC. If you don't find four friends you can fill in the missing spots with bots or just leave them open. The additional eighth, multiplayer exclusive game mode is like CTF with cars. The goal is to hold the flag and drive as far away from the enemies as possible to get a point. To keep the race interesting for the players that are already out of it, they can use a helicopter which flies over the track to launch missile attacks on the cars still racing. So you can take your revenge before the race is even over and the racers have one more thing to worry about. But this feature can be deactivated when you setup the race.

(Allied Nations), who have entered the company to try and bring back stability to the region and The Chinese Army, who hope to take control of Venezuela as well, marking themselves as a true superpower.****The gameplay is basically the same as the previous version, with the control scheme virtually the same, but there are some tweaks as well. One of which is a new way to hijack a vehicle.

Packing almost 3 times as many features as the original MGS3, Subsistence adds more depth and persona to the original MGS3 by adding more tweaks and content to the gameplay.****In MGS3: Snake Eater is set in Cold War Russia, as tensions are rising between America and the USSR.  Naked Snake, a highly trained stealth operative from the US, is dropped in Russia on a top secret mission to rescue a nuclear scientist, Sokolov, from the hands of the Russians.  But soon things turn ugly.  The rescue mission is botched, and a weapon of mass destruction, codenamed the Shagohod, is stolen from the Russians by terrorists.  Not only this, but a nuclear missile is launched on to one of Russia's most important research facilities.  Snake must return to Russia in order to set things right and prevent the breakout of a nuclear war.****The premise of the game is that Snake must use stealth- not guns- to complete his objectives.  Getting into a gunfight will more often than not get Snake killed.  Instead, Snake must use his surroundings and good timing to sneak past the enemy and ensure the destruction of the Shagohod.****Included with the release is the entire game of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater with a number of additions.  The European Extreme has been added as an available difficulty level, being the hardest difficulty level in the entire series.  New face paints and more camera angles have been added to the mix, as well as a myriad of other features including a Duel Mode, allowing players to face off against their favorite bosses anytime they want.  Back by popular demand, Snake vs. Monkey has also returned with more maps than before!****Besides this, included on the bonus disk is a new online mode that has been included with Subsistence.  This new mode allows players to play MGS3 online with other players around the world.  Sony's servers allow the player to keep track of stats and friends.  Players can play with others around the world in different match types such as Capture mission and Sneaking missions.  To wrap up the original trilogy, Subsistence comes with the original version of the MSX games Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake.  Never before released in America, the inclusion of these two games wraps up the entire series of games in the original trilogy of the origins of Solid and Naked Snake.

You take the role of a bounty hunter who has to travel the world, looking for ""wanted"" people. Accompanied by a soldier, a mechanic, and a cyborg dog, the hero must survive a journey west that will ultimately take him to remote places and lead him to battles against evil.****Metal Saga has a less linear story line that one would normally expect from a Japanese RPG - a story line that develops according to the missions you decide to take, which in their turn lead to new events and finally to different endings. The combat system features traditional party management and turn-based battles, with the addition of Metal Max's trademark tank combat. When you acquire tanks for your characters, you can use them in battles. Tanks get damaged and broken, but you will be able to customize them by finding parts scattered across the world and assembling them to build new models. Based on the model of tank many different kinds of weapons, cannons, and accessories can be equipped to it, making for hundreds of different options. Tanks can even be given a custom paint job that is saved to the memory card."

Playing as Sonny Crockett or Ricardo Tubbs, the player must dismantle drug-lord Ortega's organization, following the plot of an episode of the series.****Through 14 missions, the player must take down (or arrest, sometimes) drug dealers and solve some minor puzzles (like finding keys to open doors, or switching levers to get access to locked places). In some stages, the player can choose freely to play as Crockett or Tubbs, switching between them by the click of a button. They have different abilities (Tubbs, for instance, is tougher and can kick in doors, Crockett is more agile), and different weapons (Crockett has a pistol as primary weapon, Tubbs has a double barreled shotgun).

The characters will heal themselves as the time passes, and they can heal each other: if one of them dies, the other can revive him.****The characters can interact with the environment: whenever an action is possible, an icon will appear, showing which action can be taken, such as opening (or breaking) doors, climbing ladders, etc. Jumping is part of those particular actions, as the characters can only jump at specific places where the proper icon shows up. As for other actions, characters can run, crouch, walk and lean against walls. To shoot enemies, the player must aim (with an auto aim button) and then shoot (with a shoot button).****The game features the original theme from the TV show, as well as original voices.
Michigan - Report From Hell (Europe)>Michigan - Report From Hell>2005>ESRB - AO (Adults Only)>Spike Co., Ltd.>Grasshopper Manufacture>Adventure>3.1>1 Player>In Michigan, players take the role of a rookie cameraman for ZaKa TV, the entertainment division of the powerful ZaKa conglomerate. Accompanied by Brisco, an outspoken sound engineer, and Pamela, a reporter, the player is sent to investigate a mysterious mist that has descended over the city. The player quickly discovers that the mist is somehow transforming people into fleshy, leech-like monsters with human limbs. Pamela is attacked by the creatures, and is later found in the process of transforming into one. The player, Brisco, and a new female reporter are sent to investigate the source of the monster outbreak.  It is eventually revealed that the cause of the monsters is a mutative virus developed by a scientist, Dr. O'Conner, intended to be used as a biological weapon against the enemies of the United States. The virus was developed with the complicity of the U.S. military, the U.S. government, as well as the powerful ZaKa group for whom the protagonists work.  After unsuccessfully attempting to retrieve a vaccine for the virus, the camera crew attempt to evacuate the city by heading to an airport on the outskirts of the city where a military evacuation transport is supposed to arrive. At the airport, the group encounters a strange young man who appears to be intellectually disabled. He somewhat disjointedly reveals that he was Dr. O'Conner's original guinea pig, and begins to run around and yell immaturely in a bizarre manner. After the player commands the reporter to shoot the strange man, he transforms into a massive pile of mutated flesh before exploding messily. With the man's death, the mist clears, and Brisco theorizes he was the cause of both the mist and the monster outbreak.  In the game's epilogue, the camera crew approach a nearby lighthouse, which the military has ordered them to activate so that the transport plane can locate them and pick them up. While the tired reporter waits outside, Brisco and the cameraman ascend the lighthouse and activate the light at the top. Suddenly, Brisco begins to mutate; the cameraman flees, and the Brisco-creature laughs maniacally before escaping out a window.  The game ends with a final film clip depending on the actions of cameraman. The cameraman attempts to reveal the identity of the people behind the virus on camera, but he's killed by an unseen assassin before he gives a name.

While some are harder than others, they all allow you the chance to create equipment you'd never be able to get if you only played offline.****Thankfully, you won't be fighting with your bare hands. When you first begin your game, you are given a simple sword and shield, but as you complete missions and harvest materials from both the creatures you kill and various nooks and crannies in the environments, you can begin to craft stronger weapons and armor for yourself. On top of that, you can also use berries, plants, shells and more to craft healing items, stat boosters and even ammunition if you opt to use a bowgun.****There are several weapon types in Monster Hunter, including the bowgun (perfect for group support and long-range attacks), Great Swords (huge and slow, but very powerful and a great reach), and even Hammers (The most powerful weapon class, but cannot block). Most weapons can even be upgraded once you create them, allowing you to add damage, sharpness and even elemental attributes.****The game is played out through missions you take from the Hunter's Guild (or the village elder if you're playing solo), and these missions range from material gathering, to egg stealing, and even live capture. Combat is all real-time. The left analog stick moves your hunter while the right stick is actually used for attacking. Different directions on the stick trigger different types of attacks, even allowing for some simple combos.****The story in Monster Hunter is a very basic one. You want to be the best Hunter ever, so you go out to prove yourself. That's really all there is to it.

You go on adventures to obtain items necessary for mini-quests (there are many of those) and to further advance the plot.  These adventures are full of challenges and ways to improve your monster, as in the other MR games.****An important thing to remember about this game is that you are not the sole trainer. In face, you do very little training because you assign others in your circus group to do it for you.  That being said, MR EVO is a very plot-oriented game, with less of an emphasis on combat than its predecessors."

She uses trucks as inline skates and has to avoid obstacles by jumping or mastering quick time events (pressing a displayed button in a limited time).****In co-op mode the second player takes the role of a Dr. Cockroach and supports the main player with appropriate actions, e.g. shooting. The player can unlock a lot of bonus material, e.g. concept art, deleted scenes (in this case: levels) or audio commentaries.

Different types of attacks are available; hand to hand attacks tend to be more powerful but leave you open to a counter attack while ranged attacks are safer but deal less damage. On each turn each member of your party is given a limited amount of energy to use for attacks; different attacks use different amounts of energy. Lower powered attacks typically use less than the energy quota for a turn allowing you to save up the unused energy for a more powerful attack in a later turn. Each character also has a limited number of technique points which can be used for additional abilities such as healing, increasing armor, special attacks, and so on. At any given time up to three characters can be in the front line and take action in battles; any additional characters remain in the back line and are unable to attack, however you can switch characters around on each turn.

Both are led by Narcotics chief Joe Kowalski (voiced by Ron Pearlman), and the player switches between the two as the story unfolds.****As an undercover cop, players are free to roam the streets and dispense justice at their discretion. Aside from storyline missions, players can encounter 12 types of randomized street crimes and stop them to boost their ""badge rating"" (loosely, a measure of their trust within the police). Players can likewise flash their badge around to cause perps to surrender or run. Criminals that resist must be beaten in a small ""struggle"" minigame to get cuffed. Players can also arrest alleyway drug dealers and deposit their drugs safely at the station.****Alternatively, the player can beat up drug dealers for their cash and stash, then sell the drugs to civilians for income. The player can also use the drugs themselves for temporary beneficial effects (ecstasy keeps enemies from attacking, speed makes you run and shoot faster, etc.) at the cost of badge points and the potential to become addicted. Excessive use of force against innocent civilians, or selling drugs to other undercover cops, result in major losses of badge points.****Players have a maximum badge rating of 100.  If it drops below 49, they are demoted to Patrolman and cannot take new story missions. The player must roam the streets in their police blues and stop enough random crimes to be moved back to Narcotics. If the player's rating drops below 24, they are kicked off the force and rendered jobless.  Jobless players cannot fight or shoot  weapons without attracting police attention. Further drops in rating cause the player to be wanted by the police, with a rating of 5 or lower spawning officers specifically to shoot or arrest the player.****There are 25 hidden drug stashes in each city. Finding all of them will unlock the original N.A.R.C. arcade game for play."

Naruto - Ultimate Ninja 2 (USA)>Naruto - Ultimate Ninja 2>2007>ESRB - T (Teen)>Namco Bandai Games>CyberConnect2>Fighter>3.8>1-2 Players>Based on Masashi Kishimoto’s manga (and anime adaptation later) Naruto, Ultimate Ninja 2 is the second installment of the Ultimate Ninja series. The current Naruto game has cel shaded graphics and features the following modes: Ultimate Road, VS. Duel, Iruka’s Training, Naruto’s House and Tanzaku Market.****1. Ultimate Road: Ultimate Road is your basic story mode and focuses on the events that took place on the finals of the Chunin Exam up to the point where Tsunade agrees to become the 5th Hokage. There is also an additional story that revolves around Tsunade and becomes accessible when you finish the main story. The particular mode features pre-rendered backgrounds that you can freely move within and 4 locations including the Village Hidden in the Leaves and Tanzaku Town. To advance the story you need to talk to certain people and win a row of battles each time. With each battle you’re given certain conditions that should be met in order to win. Such conditions are simply to win the battle, fight till time is up or more challenging like win the battle – with enemy’s defense power high. For specific events you may also choose a support character, before the battle starts, that will appear at regular intervals to give you items like shuriken and ninja scrolls that can be thrown to the enemy. The battles are one on one and play like in Vs. Duel mode. When the battle ends you get money and points depending on how many of your available moves you used, how many items you used, in how many arenas you fought, etc. You can spend money on Tanzaku Market and can use points to customize your characters’ stats like Attack and Defense from the menu. From the menu you can also check any missions available. Missions are actually battles with conditions such as the ones that are mentioned at the beginning but are of wider variety and higher difficulty.****2. VS. Duel: A versus fighting mode where you can choose your fighter and the opponent from 32 players available to fight versus the CPU or a human player. You start with 17 players and can unlock the rest by talking to them or defeating them in a fight in Ultimate Road mode. In the battle you get your basic moves like the substitution jutsu, double jump, blocking, etc. that are the same for all the players and combos and special techniques that are different to each character and do more damage than your normal moves. The arenas have multi-layers and destructible objects that reveal items you can throw or points to replenish your chakra (it can also be replenished by throwing your opponent to the ground or holding down the down cursor button). Chakra is what some combos and all 3 levels of special techniques need to execute.  When executing special techniques you are given the chance to interact with them. For example you may have to continuously push a certain button, rotate the right analog stick or press a combo of buttons that appear on the screen. If done correctly you may proceed to the next “stage” of the attack, add critical damage to it or reduce damage and/or cancel a technique if it’s initiated by the opponent.****3. Iruka’s Training: This is a practice mode where you can choose any of the 32 players available and master their moves.****4. Naruto’s House: Here you can view items bought at Tanzaku Market as well as enter codes.****5. Tanzaku Market: In Tanzaku Market you can buy Figures, Videos, Music, Ninja Info Cards, etc. that can be viewed at Naruto’s House.

Need for Speed - Carbon (USA)>Need for Speed - Carbon>2006>ESRB - E10+ (Everyone 10+)>Electronic Arts, Inc.>EA Canada>Driving>4.2>1-2 Players>The 2006 game in the Need for Speed series is an evolution of the gameplay introduced in the previous games. The career mode offers complete freedom in a city with a story mode supported by FMV cutscenes, as featured in Need for Speed: Most Wanted, but now also set in the Carbon Canyon, where racers duel for territory in the city below. There still are many police pursuits. At the same time, the focus on tuning and sculpting your car remains, as introduced in Need for Speed Underground. As you win money from races, you can visit garages and car lots to make improvements to your vehicle.****Enhancements are still unlocked gradually, but the cars have now been divided over different tiers. There are about 40 cars to unlock. Many of them have been featured in previous installments, but there is a new selection and this year's edition introduces powerful muscle cars such as the Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger. Other features include the possibility to form your own crew, more detailed sculpting features, drifting races (introduced in NFS:U and replaced by drag races in NFS:MW) and the new car classes. The PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions offer online multiplayer, missing from the PS2, GC and Xbox releases. Up to eight players can race together, in the Pursuit Tag or Pursuit Knockout modes, with a few variations. Pursuit Tag is a race of one civilian car against cop cars. To become the civilian car, you have to tag it and then try to fend off the cops as long as possible until you are tagged again by other players. In Pursuit Knockout everyone starts as a civilian car, but the last one at the end of the first lap becomes a cop and needs to cause as much damage as possible to the other speeders. Another mode allows you to drive cooperatively (up to four players) in a single race.****The city and the surroundings in the career mode have been divided into different territories, controlled by gangs. You are either invited or challenged to race in the sections and claim them as your own. To do so, you have to impress the gang leader by winning races until he challenges you for a duel - first in the city, then over the narrow roads of Carbon Canyon. Scores are based on proximity. You need to follow the boss in the first race, and he is in pursuit in the second one. There are 4 boss duels in total.****The crew feature, with room for up to 6 cars, allows you to assign three roles to racers: drafters, scouts and blockers. These are supporting characters you can hire to help you win races. Drafters leave behind a coloured trail that makes it easier to find the way, scouts discover hidden shortcuts, and blockers try to cause mayhem to slow your opponents down. If you hire a scout, you get access to the new AutoSculpt feature. It enables you to modify the height of every part of your car through sliders, solely for visual effect. You can also buy full body kits.

That being said, the player has extensive options for tuning the gameplay for either a fast-paced arcade experience, or a slower, more sim-like style of play.****As with competing titles, Hitz Pro supports a franchise mode, season and exhibition gameplay and a game tutorial/practice mode. The title also sports a pickup hockey mode with several environments that are reminiscent of playing hockey in outdoor venues.

The construction of the village and the life of its people evolve in real-time. In battle, either field battles or sieges, up to 24 units on each side ranging from spearmen to cannon troops can engage in real-time 3D battle. Routing the enemy lowers their morale, which allows the use of charges and counter attacks. In siege battles, the adequate use of skills and resources is key to victory.  When most of the land is under the player's control, the 'Kessen' command becomes available. Kessen is an all-or-nothing all-out attack that will either result in the unification of the land, or the total loss of the player's land.

When they killed Herbert Friedman, the conductor of the biological experiment with the black flowers, they assumed everything was okay, of course it was not. The seeds of the flower had already spread around and it grew and blossomed without much notice. When it was discovered, that the flowers contain a dangerous substance that induces strange but vivid dreams, it became the new hit drug on the campus. Now the seeds begin to germinate and the bad trip turns into a horrible nightmare. The only ones that really know what is going on are the ones that are experiencing it for the second time and hide terrible secrets inside themselves...****Most of the time you take control over two of the six available characters. Each one has a speciality that comes in handy in order to open blocked doors or reaching new heights. Kenny for example has more muscles than brain and is therefore able to move around crates. Mei is instead a hacker and knows how to hack access panels. You can switch between both characters at any time and if you need another character in a given situation, you can go back to a gathering point and change your team.****But their wits alone can't save them from their doom so they also find several different weapons ranging from melee-weapons like a baseball bat to pistols and other weapons with a serious punch.

And, while you're at it, Stan would also like you to help him take over the world.****The game plays similarly to most JRPGs. Ari will visit towns and fight (turn based) battles against monsters - which in this game happen to be things like wild cows and man eating onions. Party members level up and gain new skills as they gain experience. Ari can respond to the story and other characters with a number of different dialogue options, such as a nice response, a rude response, or a silly response, and how he acts will affect how different party members feel about him.

Oni (USA)>Oni>2001>ESRB - T (Teen)>Rockstar Games, Inc.>Rockstar Toronto>Beat-'Em-Up>3.1>1 Player>"It's 2032. The planet is now ruled by the World Coalition Government which annexed 80% of the countries, with the remaining quickly dragged into the WCG. While their official goal was to solve humankind's problems, it was about money. Massive spending bankrupted poorer countries, and soon all traces of individual government disappeared. For those who were poor, the situation didn't improved one bit, and for the richer, maintaining the status was done at the expense of their privacy and personal freedoms. To make things worse, life outside the major cities, far from the atmosphere processors is nearly impossible, as the so-called ""Wilderness Preserves"" are poisoned, and those who venture into them risk a painful death.****Konoko, fresh out from TCTF (Technology Crimes Task Force, a secret police to take cyber drugs and weapons from the streets, as well as explore the induced technophobia to operate and investigate on a blank check permission) academy is placed under the command of Terrance Griffin and Dr. Kerr and linked to a SLD - an android - called Shinatama, who is neurally linked to her. However, Konoko knows next to nothing about her past, other that she was orphaned at the age of three and felt ""different"" to other people while was being brought up under the wing of TCTF. After many years in training, she has finally the chance to prove herself to Griffin and the TCTF, and so, heads for a warehouse rumoured to be under the control of the Syndicate, a criminal organization which grew exponentially after a young man called ""Boss Muro"" climbed to the top of the organization.****Inspired by the classic Anime series Ghost in the Shell by Shirow Masamune, gameplay is a mix between generic third-person shooter and a classic beat'em up. While Konoko has at her disposal several hand-to-hand  acrobatic moves (with more unlocked as the player advances), she can also find weapons in the levels, and the decision to go armed or bare-fisted is only up to the player. Each weapon either draws from ballistic or energy cell clips, the number of rounds in each clip depending on the weapon: a Black Adder (a short, one-hand machine gun like an Uzi) can get 30 rounds from a ballistic clip, while a Mercury Bow (a sniper railgun sans scope) only two. Combined with the limited availability of clips, this adds a strategic element to the game, as the player can only carry a weapon at a time, so if a powerful weapons runs out of ammo, the player must choose between keeping the weapon and fight hand to hand with the enemies until Konoko finds fresh ammo clips, or discard it for a lesser gun that uses different ammo. However, if the player runs out of ammo completely when facing a tough challenge, Konoko can ""overdose"" on hypo sprays (used to heal damage) by using them over her natural health bar, which provides her with faster movement and tougher blows."

Kaede can reach some locations that are beyond Samanosuke as well as pick locks and throw kunai, but she can not absorb souls or open any lock intended for the wearer of the Ogre gauntlet.

The U.S. government decided that a large-scale attack would prove risky, and so a small group of Special Forces was formed...  ""Only one machine is fit for such a task...""  In this simulator the player controls an AH-64 Apache, the ""primary attack helicopter in the U.S. Arsenal"". It can be controlled from 5 different points of view, including 1st (inside the cockpit) and 3rd person ones. The on screen display holds valuable information to the pilot, such as damage meters, status of engines, rotor brakes, wheel brakes and hover, air speed, altitude, compass, radar, RPM, Torque, Fuel and more.  The game features two control systems: arcade and physics mode. In arcade mode the helicopter maintains altitude while flying forward, while the physics mode is based on real world physics, thus, when the helicopter is moving forward, it will also lose altitude if the motor power isn't increased. The helicopter can be controlled either with a keyboard/mouse combo or with a joystick.  The AH-64 comes equipped with 3 different types of weapons: Hellfire Missiles, m230 Chain Gun 30mm Automatic Cannon and Hydra Rockets. There is also a fourth kind of weapon, the Zuni Rockets, only available later in the game. Hellfire missiles are target lockable and the Cannon can be aimed with the mouse.  There are 30 unique missions in this game; in most of them the player must accomplish several objectives, usually destroying enemy buildings and vehicles. The game can be saved at the end of each mission, but not during them. If the player gets killed during a mission, he must start it all over again, but the number of tries is unlimited."
Operation Air Assault 2 (Europe)>Operation Air Assault 2>2007>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Midas Interactive Entertainment>Midas Interactive Entertainment>Simulation>3.8>1 Player>Apache Longbow Assault is a helicopter simulator for the AH-64 Apache Longbow variant and the follow-up to AH-64 Apache Air Assault. Similar to the previous game it is a mix of a simulation and arcade so players can start right away. The in-game cockpit then serves largely as a reference frame rather than complex manipulation by the player.  The only game mode is a linear campaign that consists of about 30 missions. They take place during different times of day, weather and over varied terrain, including mountains, beaches and seas. It features head-to-head fights with other helicopters, attacking AA batteries, ships and ground vehicles, rescue operations and defense missions. Before starting the mission, a loadout can be defined as it is possible to run out of ammo. Weapons include Hydra rockets, Hellfire missiles and a M230 cannon. Optionally automatic targeting can be enabled. There is a night vision view and flares can be launched to assist the ground operations.
Operative, The - No One Lives Forever (USA)>Operative, The - No One Lives Forever>2002>ESRB - T (Teen)>Sierra Entertainment, Inc.>Monolith Productions>Shooter>3.4>1 Player>"Sometime in the 1960s, Cate Archer is the only female agent in the service of U.N.I.T.Y., a worldwide secret agency. Having been relegated to menial tasks over the years, Archer is finally given a chance to prove herself when a terrorist organization called H.A.R.M. starts to knock off active field agents. Under the qualification of ""being available"" as a trained agent, Cate is finally given the authority to track down and investigate these H.A.R.M. activities. In missions around the globe, Agent Archer will find herself sniping assassins, stealing documents, and doing a host of other suitably sneaky, but often deadly espionage tasks.****No Ones Lives Forever is a 1st person shooter/sneaker that focuses on remaining undetected and obtaining intelligence data. Combining elements of James Bond (including Rare's Goldeneye 007 and Perfect Dark), Thief and Deus Ex, Cate will need use her weaponry and gadgets to get the drop on enemy agents. Among the gadgets available are photographic sunglasses, a lockpicking barrette, Body Remover (tm) powder, a cigarette lighter which can be used for wielding, lipstick explosives and a robotic poodle (for distracting guard dogs).****Emphasizing sneakiness, the game not only gives extra points for not being seen, but also pulls tricks like alarms that cannot be shut off and guards that don't return to their docile ways once alerted to your presence. The AI does interesting things, such as knocking tables over and ducking for cover. But, at least on the lower difficulty levels, the game is willing to play with your aggressions and those who prefer shooting first and asking questions later can often gleefully blaze through the levels like a continuous action scene from a Bond flick. However while the mission will get completed, Agent Archer will relieve a lower score for taking the non-subtle approach.****The game has the feel of the 1960's all over it and it shows through the artwork and the music, which are both very much in character with the period, from the loud outfits to the beatnik rythmn in the bars. In a homage to the old 60's spy movies and series, there are plenty of surprises, shootouts, close calls, memorable villains, and over-the-top action scenes."
Orphen - Scion of Sorcery (USA)>Orphen - Scion of Sorcery>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Activision, Inc.>Shade>Role-Playing>3.4>1 Player>Orphen: Scion of Sorcery is the game based on the hit Japanese anime Sorcerous Stabber Orphen, (released outside of Japan as just Orphen).  Orphen, his apprentice Majik, traveling partner Cleo and her pet dog/magical-wolf Leki, and the two mischievous trolls Volkan and Dorton, sail to the mysterious Chaos Island in search of wealth and riches.  Also on the voyage are three strangers whose destinies pull Orphen and his companions into their mysterious journey.  Only the powerful dark sorcerer Orphen, (in his trademark bemused manner), can discover what connections there are between the three strangers and the powers that rule the island, and keep himself and his companions alive long enough to find a way off of the ephemeral Chaos Island.****Orphen: Scion of Sorcerery is a mix between adventure and some light RPG elements.  Orphen is a dark sorcerer and attacks his enemies with various spells including a magical sword and elementals.  The game is played in the third person perspective looking over Orphen's shoulder.  You will run, jump, and explore your way through large levels on Chaos Island in varying environments; engage in boss battles that require you to use some puzzle solving and timing skills; and level up your dark magic. Once beaten, the game encourages replay by following branching story lines not taken in the previous play-through.  The game maintains the feeling of the anime, particularly in the character designs and bantering dialogue.  Orphen: Scion of Sorcery is entirely voice acted.

P.T.O. IV - Pacific Theater of Operations (USA)>P.T.O. IV - Pacific Theater of Operations>2003>ESRB - E (Everyone)>KOEI Corporation>Koei>Strategy>3.9>1 Player>"The fourth installment in Koei's P.T.O. series brings strategic naval combat to the PS2.  There are two levels of play: global strategy and resource management are handled with a turn-based system on a world map while individual battles are fought using a real-time system on a much smaller scale.****The campaign can be played as the Americans, British, Japanese, or Germans, starting either in September 1939 or December 1941.  If a players chooses to be American or Japanese with a 1939 start date, they will sit on the sidelines and watch the war until December 1941, but they will still be able to gather resources and spend them to build units or develop technologies.  Players can also concoct ""what-if"" scenarios by changing which countries belong to which powers: for example, one could play an Alliance of America and Germany against an Axis of Japan and Great Britain, or even play three-on-one for more of a challenge.****The world map used in the turn-based grand strategy side of the game is broken down into territories connected in a web of lines indicating where fleets may pass from territory to territory.  Game turns on this scale represent one month, and the time it takes a fleet to move from one territory to another correlates loosely to the length of the line connecting them.****Players collect resources from the territories they control every turn.  Resources include money, iron ore, aluminum, and oil.  Money is used for construction of new units and facilities and to speed scientific development, iron is used in construction of ships, aluminum is used in construction of aircraft, and oil is consumed when fleets move.****Technological advances are not purchased; instead players direct their scientists to focus on particular developmental paths, and breakthroughs come semi-randomly.  The longer the scientists have been working on a particular problem, the more likely a breakthrough becomes.  Giving the scientists extra money accelerates this process.  In addition to the ship and aircraft types that become available automatically with scientific advancements, players can design their own custom types using whatever technology is available to them at the time.****Players decide which types of ships and aircraft to build and how many.  Ships are formed into fleets that can be moved about the world map while aircraft can be assigned to defend land-based airfields or assigned to fleets with ships capable of carrying aircraft.****When two hostile fleets meet in the same territory, or when a hostile fleet enters a territory defended by land-based aircraft, a battle ensues.  Battles are controlled in real-time with a 3-D isometric view.  Players control entire fleets, not individual ships.  Orders include sending a fleet to a particular point, ordering a fleet to attack a particular other fleet or airfield, and launching and recovering aircraft for CAP or to attack a particular fleet or airfield.****Players can assign the computer to control as much or as little of strategy as desired.  A player who enjoys the turn-based grand strategy but not the real-time battles can have the computer automatically resolve individual battles.  Conversely, a player who enjoys the real time battles but not resource management can assign various aspects of resource management to the computer so that the player only has to decide where to move fleets.  At the extreme, a player could even assign fleet movement to the computer and focus entirely on real-time combat.  The game also offers a scenario mode that skips grand strategy entirely and throws the player into an individual battle."

Each round begins with a mini-game which determines how far a player can move on the board. Each tile on the board enables players to move forward or go backward, lose, gain, or steal tokens, play a single or two-player mini-game, spend earned tokens, or a raffle game to earn redemption tickets. ****With ""Store"" tiles, players can spend tokens to move forward, move other players backward, buy raffle tickets, or gamble for more tokens.****Once a player reaches the end of the board, players receive redemption tickets based on how far they got on the board. These can be used to buy each mini-game separately for tournament play outside the game.  Once all the mini-games have been purchased, players can add up all of their tickets to total up their overall high score."

You have a choice of three different models to take photographs of: Riho (a sporty girl), Lena (a supermodel), and Nano (an Internet idol).****Initially, you have a basic camera, but as you take better photographs, you can earn more money to upgrade its functionality.  New lenses, such as telephoto and wide angle lenses can be used, and a tripod can be purchased to stop your shaky hands.****To get models to perform poses for you and to look at you, you can also perform an ""appeal"".  You can dance, jump, call out, or wave your hands - each appeal has a different mini-game associated with it.  If you perform the same appeal multiple times in a row, your subject will lose interest, so it's important to vary your actions.  The more success you have with appeals, the more interesting and unique poses you can get your model to perform (which are worth more points in the photo shoot)."

Prince of Persia - The Sands of Time (USA)>Prince of Persia - The Sands of Time>2003>ESRB - T (Teen)>Ubisoft Entertainment SA>Ubisoft>Action>3.8>1 Player>The story of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time starts with the Prince and his father, the King of Persia, besieging the Maharajah's castle to plunder the treasures hidden inside. In order to impress his father, the Prince sneaks inside to recover the magical Dagger of Time. He quickly learns that this dagger has the ability to control time. The malevolent Vizier has other plans for the dagger, however, and tricks the Prince into unlocking a mysterious secret of the Dagger that causes the King and many of his subjects to be turned into sand zombies. Now, the Prince must figure out what has happened and try to set things right again.****Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is an action adventure game that updates many of the gameplay concepts from the original two games and brings them into a fully 3-dimensional world. The Prince will engage in sword fighting, wall climbing, spike dodging, puzzle solving, and more in his quest. The Prince also carries the Dagger of Time, which allows him to unleash several magical powers.  The most important of these powers is the ability to reverse time. This ability allows the player to reverse their actions when they lead the Prince to his death.

As he fights to reclaim his kingdom from the hands of a madman, he must also battle with his own inner demons as the Dark Prince threatens to consume him entirely.****The game is very similar (in terms of fight and puzzle sequences) to the previous installments of UbiSoft's Prince of Persia trilogy: The Sands of Time and Warrior Within. There are some major innovations like the character of Dark Prince, who possess the main protagonist from time to time and offers him new combos and moves. There is also new ability, called ""Speed Kill"", which is very effective against all opponents in the game (victims are attacked from behind and murdered in brutally fashion).****In Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones player will explore not only the streets of Babylon, but also a ruined palace of his father, temple and the famous Hanging Gardens."

There are still plenty of options for time manipulation and the storyline also lets you travel back and forth in time, visiting the same locations in an alternate time period.
Prisoner of War (Europe)>Prisoner of War>2002>ESRB - K-A (Kids to Adults)>Codemasters Software Company Limited, The>Wide Games>Action>3.3>1 Player>It is World War II, and the player takes the role of an American pilot, Captain Lewis Stone, who is thrown into a prison camp of the Nazis. While attempting to escape the camp, Captain Stone discovers that the Germans are developing a secret weapon they intend to use against the Allies. Soon his personal wish of escape turns into a desire to save the world from the destruction the Nazis are planning.  Prisoner of War can be described as a stealth game. Unlike most other games of its kind (e.g. the Thief series), the game relies on stealth entirely, without offering violent options. The protagonist is helpless in the prison camp, and his only weapon is his wit. Sneaking past guards to deliver an important object to a fellow prisoner, hiding items, staying in shadows to avoid being recognized, and other stealth-based activities occupy the largest portion of the game.

The shoulder buttons are also used, the L1 and R1 is used for the rider to tighten their grip on the bull to keep from being thrown off, however these are only present in the medium and hard modes.  Likewise, the L2 and R2 are used for both the bull and rider and for their signature modes.  The X button is also used for the rider to dismount the bull, hitting it again while in air to land on their feet will give the player bonus points, also the X button can also be used during the ride to spur on the bull, resulting in bonus points as well.  Additionally, the bull can receive bonus points by breaking cameras and signs scattered around the side of the pen.****There are two different meters with the same purpose, the rider has a health meter which can be lowered, the lower it is the more likely the player will be thrown off.  Additionally, if a rider is injured in a ride, their health will be depleted slightly for the next round.  A rage meter is used for the bull, the higher the meter the more likely they can buck off a rider, but the lower it is the more the rider has a chance to complete the ride.****There are also power-ups that can be obtained through the season mode (however only in the medium and hard difficulty levels) that are obtained for scoring a certain sets of points for a round.  For the rider a spur is obtained and can be used to slow down the bull while the bull receives a set of horns that speeds up the bull and increases the chances of throwing off a rider.  These power-ups are activated by pressing and holding the Down button on the D-pad for a second.****There is also multiplayer capabilities where two friends can battle head-to-head, one as the rider and the other as the bull.

Pro Evolution Soccer 2010 (USA)>Pro Evolution Soccer 2010>2009>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Konami Digital Entertainment GmbH>Konami>Sports/Soccer>4.1>1-8 Players>"Konami has announced that Liverpool FC and Spanish international striker Fernando Torres is to join Lionel Messi as the cover stars of PES 2010!   Torres, 25, has enjoyed an incredibly successful season both at club and international level, and will now join UEFA Champions League winner Messi on the front of PES 2010's packaging. Pro Evolution Soccer 2010 Game •Enhanced Realism: PES 2010 delivers a pace of game in tune with football played at the highest level. Triangulation of passes and use of off-the-ball runs are key to breaking down the opposition, forcing the player to use the strengths of their team mates to create scoring opportunities. Gone are 'soft' goals that can be used to break the deadlock - instead, only working the channels and the precision play expected of great players will make a difference. •Player Characteristics: Key skills of the many players have now been attributed named, allowing users to incorporate them into their play strategy. Cover star Torres, for instance, is renowned for his ability to receive a pass in the penalty area, and to drop the ball to a teammate in a good position for a goal-scoring opportunity. As such, he is labeled a ""Fox In The Box"" and ""Goal Poacher"", in line with his prowess in both scoring and setting up goals. •Instant Tactical Switching: Each team has unique settings matching their real-life playing styles. Torres at Liverpool, for instance, will recreate the Merseyside club's sophisticated play and high numbers in attack, their pressing from midfield, strong defensive line, and width across the pitch. For the offense, the default settings support wide attacks and the aim to move in the back of the opponent's defense line. The user can summon the bar instantly during a match to adjust team tactics to enhance their defence or strengthen attacks. •Master League: The Master League now incorporates "
Pro Evolution Soccer 2011 (USA)>Pro Evolution Soccer 2011>2010>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Konami Digital Entertainment GmbH>Konami>Sports/Soccer>4>1-8 Players>Total Control: PES Productions has enhanced the 360-degree passing ratio, offering unprecedented levels of control over every pass, shot, throw-in, through ball and lofted through balls. This allows users to pass the ball into space, and move their play with total freedom. Players must precisely weight their passes and second-guess the runs of their team-mates and exploit their movement. Players even can apply pressure on opponents to force them off the ball. •Shot & Stamina Gauge: In addition to the generic power gauge, the Shot & Stamina meter details the player's exact level of fitness. Constantly sprinting will affect the player's movements and will have an adverse affect on his stats, with passes going awry and a loss of pace. •New Defender AI: Defenders now hold their positions naturally, no longer chasing any ball that enters their area - preferring to close down the attacker and force them into a mistake. •Animation and Player Physics: PES Productions has totally reworked every element of in-game animation. These additions will become clear before even kick-off, with the players enjoying fluid, natural movements, with more realistic acceleration and inertia than ever before. The physicality between players is also improved, which was a priority requested in PES forums. Jostling and blocking now looks stunning, while there is a larger variety of convincing tackling styles. Ambient animation also adds immensely to the in-game atmosphere, as players behave realistically when off the ball, and walk and run with a variety of individual styles. •Speed of Play: The new level of control means that PES 2011 enjoys a more considered pace of play, which varies dependent on situations. The game will burst into life as counter-attacks come into play, but players can dictate the pace via slow build up or exploiting available space to surge forward. It is harder to make long 
Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 (USA)>Pro Evolution Soccer 2012>2011>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Konami Digital Entertainment GmbH>Konami>Sports/Soccer>3.6>1-8 Players>PES 2012 continues KONAMI’s determination to listen to its fanbase and make key improvements to the aspects the audience demands. Thus, the focus for PES 2012 is to ensure the highest level of playability, challenge and realism for the game, whilst also improving the level of control offered to users. Fundamental changes to all areas of its AI have been made following user feedback. Similarly, teamwork is central to how the game moves and feels, enabling fans to replicate anything they would see in a real match.Active AI: PES 2012 strives to recreate the movement and team ethic of real football, and Active AI plays a vital role in this. Players will no longer flock to a ball, but will make intelligent runs to create space and draw markers, while others will make themselves available, instigate runs, and visibly call for the ball. In the box, support players will make diagonal decoy runs, full backs will overlap on the wings and midfielders will provide support from behind the ball. The new Active AI routines ensure the flow of a match is more natural, with specific routines for both attack and defence. Hold-up play implemented last year has been improved for easier control with more effectiveness. Defending as a unit plays a key role, and players now hold a tight line, check on the distance between each other, track back as a unit, and fill in for each other. As individuals they also make better decisions to close space, block and tackle.  Jostling: Physicality is a key component in PES 2012, with player strength one of their key individual attributes, and having a vital effect on how they can use their strength to win the ball in a one-on-one situation. Players now fall depending on how they are challenged, with more realistic animations used to show the challenges between two jostling players.  Graphics: Several aspects of the game have enjoyed a huge overhaul. Player facial expression is now much richer and the lighting effects are more natural, while new cameras show off the huge variety of pitch-side movement, with more detail on and around the game than ever before.  Off The Ball Control: Equally key to opening up PES 2012 is the ability to highlight any player at any time. A new system has been implemented, allowing users to switch players with ease. In defence, the right stick is now used to select any outfield player, while set pieces are also enhanced through its use. Goal kicks, corners, free kicks and throw-ins now let the user quickly take control of any player off the ball, enabling clever runs which create space for an attack.  Referee AI: Referees are also crucial to general game flow and their AI has been greatly enhanced to ensure fewer interruptions to play. Decisions are improved, and advantage is played much more regularly in offside and free kick scenarios. As such, refs will only intervene when truly necessary, but they will show cards if necessary once play has broken down.  Pass Support: Accessed through the new personal player settings, Pass Support allows users to determine the level of AI assistance when passing the ball. Players can opt for one of five settings from full support, right up to full veteran setting which switches off all assistance so that the direction, weight and speed of every pass is at their disposal

Gone are the limitations imposed by dated animation systems and AI elements, and instead PES 2014 boasts a central core that perfectly mimics the skill and awareness that elevates the world's greatest players above their peers.;Six central tenets combine to establish PES 2014 as a new benchmark in football simulations, governing everything from the way the player receives and controls the ball, the physicality of play, and the 'feel' of match-day: the rush and euphoria or crushing lows that experiencing an important games can bring. As such, the key pillars on which PES 2014 is based are:;True B all Tech: For the first time in a football simulation, PES 2014 centres everything on the ball: how it moves, and how players use it. First touch and sublime control are what set certain players apart from others. The ability to not only read a pass, but to be one step ahead and to know what is needed to gain yards on an encroaching defender. TrueBall Tech allows the player to trap or knock on a pass using the analogue stick with detailed barycentric physics determining the weight shift of the player and the height and speed of the pass, as to how the player's body will automatically shape to receive it.;Thus, the player has total control in determining how their body is angled to receive a pass, whereas previous football titles present the user with scant options. Instead, TrueBall Tech means that it can be chested or nodded past an opponent, flicked into space or to a team mate, while closer dribbling control is a much more personal attribute in the new game.

In contrast to other golf simulations the tee is performed in first person mode. After choosing the club and the feet position the player needs to use both analog sticks. With the left one he simulates the swing and with the right one he relocates his body weight. It is not enough to relocate it simply in the right direction, the player needs to achieve a constant back and forth movement. ****This only works when using a gamepad, alternatively there is also a more traditional three-click control scheme in 3rd person. There the player chooses the body weight movement before the strike. With the first click he strikes out, with the second one he determines the precision and with the last one the strength. This, however, is still different to other golf simulations because the kind of swing is not chosen beforehand but determined by the swing parameters.****Less innovative are the playing modes. The game features the usual training, single tournament and career mode. The career mode however are just many tournaments tacked together. The player character improves his rank with successes but this just influences the conditions of participation for other tournaments and not the gameplay itself.****The game features nine licensed golfers, 18 courses (two licensed) and three real-life golf-commentators. With the editor the player can build own courses and tournaments.

Unfortunately an epidemic infests all kingdoms except the one inhabited by the unicorns. Of course this leads to accusations and the unicorn Pryzm is sent out to end the plague - she is accompanied by the troll magician Karrock who distrusts her. The player takes control over both of them at the same time: the left analogue stick controls the unicorn and the right one the troll.****The basic gameplay is simple: the player rides through the 16 levels and battles infected flora and fauna.  After defeat they transform back to their real selves - if the whole level (including the periodic mini bosses) is rescued the player can proceed to the next one. The roles of the heroes are evenly divided: Pryzm is used for moving at different speeds, jumping and defensive spells, e.g. stun. Karrock on the other hand uses offensive spells and his magic wand to hit the enemies nearby. The game can be played in first or third person perspective.

Also, your mecha has a unique power-bar that can only be filled by ""buzzing"" enemy bullets, which involves getting close to said bullets so that they scrape the edges of your mecha and charge it up. When max power is reached you can become invulnerable for a short time, which you can use to continue buzzing and extend your invulnerability to survive the intricate attack patterns.****The game uses polygonal graphics and features both the original arcade Psyvariar Medium Unit and a Revision mode, which upgrades the graphics and adds a few stages."

The general gameplay has the player watching a music video as symbols scroll by. The player must match the symbols on the screen with the symbols on the Pump It Up dance pad with their feet.

This is an endurance test for the player, as the game keeps giving the players songs to go through until their life bar is finally depleted. •Video Mode - This mode is unlocked after the player completes a total of twenty songs in either Home or Arcade Mode. It allows the player to just watch the videos for any song they've completed. •Tutorial mode - Teaches the player how the game works.

Puzzle Quest - Challenge of the Warlords (USA)>Puzzle Quest - Challenge of the Warlords>2007>ESRB - E10+ (Everyone 10+)>D3Publisher of America, Inc.>Infinite Interactive>Puzzle>3.8>1-2 Players>As a citizen of the kingdom of Bartonia, it's your job to discover why the Undead have begun swarming all over the world of Etheria. In this RPG hybrid you'll be following the story of your character as they rid Etheria of the Undead scourge and save Bartonia, complete sidequests for extra money, experience, items and companions, craft your own weapons and armor, capture monsters for use as mounts or to learn their spells, and even lay siege to neighboring kingdoms in order to add them to your own empire. However, Puzzle Quest is an RPG with a twist. Everything is done (as the name implies) with puzzles.****Everything in Puzzle Quest is done with puzzles. The puzzles themselves are similar to Bejeweled in execution, with a few slight variations used for things like item crafting and enemy capture.****When fighting an enemy (which can range from zombies to orcs and even castle strongholds, each with their own special spells and abilities), you both take turns using the same board. The goal is to reduce your opponents hitpoints to zero, which can be done directly by linking up skulls in rows of three or more, or by using spells which require mana. To build up mana, just link three or more runes of the same color together, just like the skulls. Every time you gain mana, it's stored in your reserves until you use it (or are hit with a mana draining attack). Gold and experience are built up in the same way, using gold coins or purple experience orbs that occupy the same board and can be linked just like runes and skulls.****The real strategy behind the game comes into play when you factor in elemental mastery (gaining extra mana when linking runes for a specific element), equipment (which can prevent damage, drain mana and more), spells (which can poison, drain mana, stun and so on) and linking up groups of four or more. The reason groups of four are important is that every time a row of four-of-a-kind is created, you get an extra turn. While it doesn't sound important, getting four runes in a row could possibly give you enough mana to cast an extremely powerful spell and give you the extra turn to cast it before your enemy can even move.****There is also a direct action mode in which players can hone their skills against various opponents independent from the story mode, as well as wireless multi-card play where two players can square off using their own characters from the campaign mode.

Radiata Stories (USA)>Radiata Stories>2005>ESRB - T (Teen)>Square Enix Co., Ltd.>Tri - Ace>Role-Playing>4>1 Player>Young Jack Russell wants to follow in the footsteps of his father, a renowned member of the Royal Radiata Knights who protect the kingdom. Unfortunately, Jack is more than a little in need of some refining. He's a bad boy with a sharp tongue and a penchant for kicking objects and even people around.  Can a world-saving quest help this obnoxious 16-year-old grow into a respectable human being?****Radiata Stories is a lighthearted and humorous fantasy role-playing game from Square Enix. You control Jack as he travels from town to town, recruiting allies and taking on menial tasks. Of course there's also a plot of saving the kingdom from certain doom, but there's plenty of time for exploring and meeting people before you'll need to worry about that. The game is fairly open-ended, allowing players to explore at their leisure.****Unlike the usual RPG, where the NPC characters simply wait around for the player to come listen to their one sentence, everyone in Radiata Stories has their own life. People wake up, go places and do things, then go back home. Learning the characters' schedules and using them to Jack's advantage is critical to a successful adventure. Sometimes they're too busy to stop and talk to you, so you have to catch them at the right time. This makes Radiata feel less like a game and more of a living, breathing world.****Combat is real-time, much like Star Ocean: Till the End of Time and Namco's Tales series, but you can give general guidelines for the NPC party members on how they should operate.  There's even a link system that lets you coordinate your party's strategy.****There are two main story paths through the game, and after you've completed one you get to keep all your money and skills the second time around.  A minimum of two play-throughs are required to discover and recruit the game's 177 potential party members.  (Shades of the Suikoden series by Konami.) Once you've recruited people as friends, you can swap your current party members at any time, but the only character you ever control yourself is Jack: if his HP falls to 0, your adventure is over.

The miners are constantly pressured by the guards to work harder and faster, while at the same time being forced to share their meager resources. While the mines itself are dangerous, so too is the mysterious plague that has broken out among the ranks of miners, killing many. Into this low morale situation, propaganda against Ultor has begun appearing, signed only by ""Eos"".

Shingen Takeda and Nobunaga Oda clans are fighting each other, trying to gain supremacy over the entire Japan. The heroine of the game is a young girl called Kurenai (""crimson""), the daughter of a prominent Japanese engineer whose new invention (apparently, a destructive weapon) has drawn the attention of the warring clans. Ninjas sent by Nobunaga Oda attack his workshop, kill him, and leave Kurenai hanging from a tree tied by tetsugen, a piece of wire used by ninjas as a weapon.

The primary weapon Kurenai uses is the deadly tetsugen. During the game you'll learn to perform new moves with this weapon. You can also use other weapons, such as a blowgun and throwing knives. Kurenai can jump, hang from ledges, and roll. There is a fair amount of platform-like sequences where she will have to demonstrate her acrobatic ninja technique. An effective way to kill enemies is to use stealth. Kurenai can approach enemies silently and hide behind objects. She can also ""seduce"" enemies, by talking to them in a sexy way and luring them to their death - a move that doesn't always work."

For instance, if you do not want to harm anyone you can take a hostage and then threaten the police to lay their weapons down and order them to face the wall. There are a few missions in which you must drive a car but mostly you walk through them. Like in the Hitman series, the game shows at the end of every mission how well you have done."

Ring of Red (USA)>Ring of Red>2001>ESRB - T (Teen)>Konami of Europe GmbH>Konami>Strategy>3.8>1 Player>"20 years ago, an alternate World War II occurred, where both Axis and Allies developed mecha technology, known as Armored Fighting Walkers (AFWs). As a result, battles continued in different ways and Russian forces were more instrumental in the eventual defeat of Japan. The end of the war has had Japan divided between  the allied forces, similar to Germany. Japan is now split into a communist North Japan and an Democratic South Japan, governed separately. Without any obvious cause, Japan erupted into civil war between it's halves for four years. Dubbed the ""Japan War"", it further weakened Japan's economy and fueled resentment between people living in the North and the South. In 1964, Masami von Weizegger is a AFW pilot in the South Japan forces. While field testing a prototype AFW, it is stolen by North Japanese agents and Masami is dispatched to recover the stolen material. As Masami's team attempts to retrieve the AFW, they stumble into a military operation that threatens to erupt into all-out war.****Ring of Red is a turn-based action/strategy game set in an alternative post-World War II Japan.  Players take the role of  members of the South Japan military who are put on a hunt for a stolen AFW.  During battles, mechs are moved into position on a grid-based map and may engage different enemy units or occupy specific points. As turns are taken, time passes, shifting the battlefield through daytime and nighttime hours as well as different weather effects. All of these affect the accuracy of weapons as well as the types of abilities that can be used. Battles end when objectives are met by either side.****Putting a twist on the turn-based genre, Ring of Red features turn-based movements with real-time combat.  When two AFWs engage on the battle grid, players are taken to a real-time battle where they have limited time to engage one another before refueling is required. Here the AFW is viewed from 3rd person and may be moved forward and back and given orders. Firing on the enemy requires aiming, in first person, by the player. The AFW uses a steam powered cannon which must be pressurized before firing, aiming at either an enemy AFW or at enemy support crew. Additionally AFWs can engage in close combat if they are close enough, delivering punches to one another. Each AFW pilot also has his own statistics and own special abilities, that can be used only once per battle, that can be called upon at any time.  AFWs also feature unique statistics, being divided into four types: Standard, Light, 4-Leg (Heavy) and Anti-AFW. ****Each AFW unit is actually a group made up of three ground units: one of which acts as crew for the AFW, while the other two walk alongside. Support units are divided into types including: Infantry, Shooter, Supply, Medical, Mechanic and Recon. Each of these types of ""support units"" has different skills in battle and individually have different abilities and statistics. The abilities available and used change depending on which positions the units are assigned to. Additionally many special abilities need to ""charge"" in the rear ranks before becoming available for usage. These abilities include firing special types of munitions (including flash, heat, smoke and impact), laying down mines or tripwire, laying down a barrage of fire, throwing grenades, healing units, sniping specific targets, morale boosts, AFW repairs, neutralization of enemy effects and disarming enemy mines/tripwire."

Robin Hood - Defender of the Crown (USA)>Robin Hood - Defender of the Crown>2003>ESRB - T (Teen)>Capcom Co., Ltd.>Cinemaware>Strategy>3>1 Player>"A complete remake of the classic 1986 title Defender of the Crown (not to be confused with the ""Remastered"" Windows version released in 2002), in Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown the player plays as the legendary folk outlaw in his quest to reclaim the throne of England after Richard Lionheart was captured in the crusades and his brother, John Lackland, usurped the throne and left him for dead in the Holy Land, attracting the ire of several knights. In a heated argument, he considered them to be traitors, causing a civil war to start.****Several gameplay features were changed from the classic title such as the player being Robin Hood himself (instead of picking one of four pretenders), full 3D graphics, a plot included with the game and the goal being to be the first to reach and conquer King John's stronghold in Cornwall. To do so, the player must build an army large enough to hold enough shires, which generate money from taxes. This money can then be used to hire new troops (peasants, archers, footmen and the mighty knights and catapults) or pay King Richard's ransom, which allow to enlist loyalist knights.****As with the original game, action occurs in a turn-based map of England where the player decides which actions to take: conquer a neighbouring shire with Little John's army and hire soldiers either for him or territory defense, raid a castle or caravan, build strongholds, hold tournaments or spy on the other lords using Maid Marian's contacts on the court. Each of the attacking actions bring a quick minigame to be played:****The first mini-game that appears is the archery raid; in this mode, the player sees the action directly from Robin Hood's eyes while he lurks on a tree, the goal being to use Robin's trustworthy  bow and arrow to hit cavalry guards and the convoy as they pass by his spot. As some guards are also armed with a bow, Robin can also hide behind the log for cover.**If the player attacks a guarded territory, the game enters a strategic mode where the battle takes place on a three-lane field, and the goal is to vanquish the enemy defenses of force him to flee  by launching direct attacks on each lane.**Sword fighting pits the player against one or more opponents, depending on the setting. The goal is simple: slash everyone by throwing blows and dodge/parry the opponents' own. During raids there is also a timer that represents the time before sunrise - failing to escape before that or being killed results on Robin's imprisonment.**Battles are done on a real-time fashion, where both armies are placed on the far-sides of a multi-lane battlefield. The player chooses which lane to attack (or defend) and if successful, the opponent will lose enough units to flee or simply wait for their deaths.**Jousting in a tournament allows the player to fight for fame, and then for gold and land. To do so, after picking an opponent, he starts by building enough speed, and then slam the spear into the opponent, the goal being to knock him from his horse.**Some shires are protected by castles, and to conquer them, first a siege must be laid in. This requires the player to load up on catapults and then destroy each wall of the fortification by throwing boulders at it. Each wall represents a part of the defending army: the most damage done, the easier it becomes to invade it."

Robot Warlords (Europe)>Robot Warlords>2001>ESRB - K-A (Kids to Adults)>Midas Interactive Entertainment>Nexus Interact>Strategy>3.3>1-2 Players>Robot Warlords is a one or two player, turn based, strategy game featuring battling robots in real Tokyo settings.  The background story, which is a single player game, is one of political unrest and intrigue, at least that's what it says in the game description. The Japanese army is attempting a military takeover, groups of them have declared martial law and are riding around in robots called Bullets to enforce it. The government doesn't want to launch an all out counter attack because that would result in massive civilian casualties. Instead they turn to Professor Matsuzakai who developed the Bullet machines and a handful of people at the Odaiba Bullet repair site. With major Kazuma Saeki in charge Operation Velvet is launched, with only four operational experimental machines at their disposal they must stop the rebellion in seven days otherwise an all out attack will be launched against the rebel forces in Tokyo with corresponding catastrophic loss of life and massive damage.  The game starts with a long conversation between the chief cabinet secretary, the head of the army and the Japanese Prime minister, This sets the scene and introduces all the characters. When this is over the player starts on their first mission. Prior to a mission each of the Bullets can be customised, this includes naming and changing the colour of each machine, assigning weapons to each arm and shoulder, and upgrading body parts. The player also has a number of TP or Technique points which they can use to install battle manoeuvres such as the 'Preparation For Combat' technique which costs three TP and decreases the enemy weapon hit ratio by -20 and the player's hit ratio by -10. Only six techniques can be installed at a time.  The game consists of eleven missions spread over a seven day period and each mission is turn based. In each turn the player selects whether they wish to move a Bullet in normal mode, just a few adjacent cells, or turbo mode in which they can travel further. While moving they may optionally employ one of the deployed combat techniques. Once the player has set their Bullet's destination they may choose whether or not to attack their opponents, in an attack multiple opponents can be selected. While various battle techniques used by the players and their opponents affect the hit ratio and consequently the damage caused by an attack, other game elements also do this. When firing through obstacles such as cars the hit ratio is halved, if the line of fire passes through two cars it is halved again and nothing gets through three cars. There are also special cells known as obstruction squares which halve the hit rate of any firing line that passes through them.

Rock Band (USA)>Rock Band>2007>ESRB - T (Teen)>MTV Games>Harmonix Music Systems>Rhythm>3.3>1-4 Players>Rock Band, by the original developers behind the Guitar Hero games, takes the concept a step further. Instead of solely playing the guitar along with songs, this game allows players to start a full virtual band with up to four players, with different sequences for each of the three supported peripherals: guitar (electric and bass), drum and microphone. Gameplay is based on hitting scrolling notes on the screen in time (scrolling vertically for drum and guitar), and getting the right pitch for the vocals (scrolling horizontally at the top of the screen, along with the lyrics).****The game offers a Solo Tour Mode for a single player or a Band World Tour (as well as Quick Play) for two to four players. By doing well players earn cash to customize the characters in the Rock Shop, with tattoos, face paint, clothing and logos. Customized characters are automatically locked to an instrument. Other customizations include movements on stage, instruments, and the general physique and appearance in the game. To succeed, players need to reach a set score through their combined performances. Multipliers for playing perfectly are tracked for the individual instruments and there can also be separate difficulty levels. The Star Power from the Guitar Hero series has been replaced by Overdrive, a meter filled by not making any mistakes in certain sections of a song. In band play using Overdrive also increases the band's score multiplier.****Players who fail during the song are locked out and the audio mix takes over. Other band members can revive the player by using their Overdrive. Failed players will however drag down the band's overall performance, so it becomes important to bring back band members. Next to the Overdrive sections, there are also Union Phrases (score bonus and extra Overdrive) and sometimes Big Rock Endings at the end of a song where another bonus can be gained.****In the Tour Mode players visit 41 venues in seventeen different cities. After the initial venues, others need a certain numbers of fans to be unlocked and certain continents only become available when tour buses or private jets are acquired. Not every venue comes with a set list of tracks. They consists of single tracks, multiple tracks, custom setlists or mystery setlists. Performing poorly can also have the band lose fans. Extra competition is included to attract managers, roadies and deals with record labels. ****Next to the main modes there is also a versus mode for the individual instruments (Tug of War), Score Duel (get the most points) and a Tutorial mode. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions feature multiplayer games with new songs through downloadable content.****The European version is not sold as a single package. Instead, there is an instruments package and the game is sold separately, for a much higher price than the original US release.
Rock Band 2 (USA)>Rock Band 2>2008>ESRB - T (Teen)>MTV Games>Harmonix Music Systems>Rhythm>3.7>1-4 Players>Rock Band 2 is the sequel to the 2007 musical simulation game Rock Band and offers similar gameplay. Directly competing with Guitar Hero: World Tour, the game allows different people to play together as in a band, with the same peripherals as the first game: lead guitar, bass guitar, microphone and a drum set.****The new drum and guitar controllers for this version, bundled or sold separately, have been revised and older controllers are also supported. The guitar controller, modelled after the Fender Stratocaster, has five additional fret buttons near the neck, for fast fingertapping sessions. There is also an effect switch to toggle between five different effects. Players use the instruments to match notes on the screen, divided in different portions for different instruments, along with the lyrics for the singer who need to match the pitch.****The original game's Solo Tour mode and the multiplayer Band World Tour mode have been merged into a single Tour mode where up to four players can cooperate, both local and online (PS3/Xbox 360). Band leaders are no longer necessary and instruments can be swapped at will. From this mode, three options are available: Start Tour (regular tour mode), Tour Challenge (different challenges), and Battle of the Bands (compete against other bands online through score tracking - not on the PS2). The game includes a training mode for the different instruments, as well as a freestyle mode for drummers where they can drum along with custom mp3 files (Xbox 360/PS3). Other modes and modifiers for the regular game modes can be selected from an Extras menu.****The in-game characters can also be customized and 84 tracks are included on the disc, with many more as downloadable content (not on the PS2). It is also possible to transfer the songs of the first Rock Band (for a price), and downloadable content as well as the two track packs.

Upon landing the first mission is a tutorial in how to use Rogue’s skills and also the Bio-chips of Gunnar and then Bagman.  The third Bio-chip of Helm is received in a later mission.  The Bio-chips have their own abilities.  Gunnar is stuck to the side of Rogue’s rifle and can be used as a sentry while Rogue flanks the enemy.  Bagman provides ammunition and upgrades for Rogue’s equipment made from salvage collected along the way and also looks after his health.  Helm is used for accessing computer consoles and panels allowing Rogue access into prohibited areas.****Rogue works his way through the various levels as stealthily as is possible trying to take the Norts by surprise with kill moves but with the arsenal at his disposal he is quite capable of also unleashing hell and going toe to toe with the enemy.  Tracking the traitor General, Rogue eventually catches up in the final mission with an abundance of Norts trying to stop him.****The game is identical across all platforms allowing the user to create numerous profiles and using a checkpoint save feature ensuring that you don’t have to go too far back in the level if you get Rogue killed.

It was released exclusively in Europe, and was based on Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2.****In gameplay, the game isn't much different from other tennis games in the market, but it differs from games such as Virtua Tennis by having some emphasis on stamina (some players get tired faster than others, and not only run slower but also lose power to return the ball on longer matches) and by forcing the player to hit the ball as well-timed as possible  - a ""nice"" ball (with a yellow visual cue near the racquet) will be much harder to return, as it will bounce away faster from the player.****Featuring 15 real players from both ATP and WTA, the game features several game modes: Roland Garros allows the player to compete in the namesake, exhibition, and spectator, where the player can just sit back and see a game played by the computer, choosing one of the many cameras available, including the classic TV presentation or from the main stand.****The beefier mode is the ProTour, where the player creates and customizes his own player, from appearance to playing style, and start a career, taking part in tournaments and completing training sessions in order to improve the player, so he or she can break into the elite. Challenge mode includes the training session mini-games of ProTour, as well as Bomb Tennis, a special mode where the court is filled with bombs, and as a player wins points, the opponent's side is flooded with even more. The goal is to detonate the bombs by pushing them into the flames, and forcing the opponent to get caught in one explosion. Also included is a complete training mode, which explains in detail the differences between shots and allows newcomers to adapt themselves to the gameplay style of this title. ****By completing certain goals, the player unlocks additional items, such as clothing, music tracks, trivia cards, player information and even secret players."

All units, cities, and structures are viewable throughout the map, not requiring any form of espionage beforehand as in earlier Romance of the Three Kingdoms games. When the player(s) decides to ""end a turn"", own and AI units will commence their actions depending on which part of the map the player is currently viewing. ****Officers**There are over 800 officers, complete with individual portraits and biographies, also including other information such as combat skills, blood ties, and unit specialization. Additionally, completing the tutorial will unlock several officers from other periods of medieval China, such as Kong Qiu (Confucius).****Officers have statistical abilities which influence how the success rate a mentioned general may carry out a specific task. The abilities are: Leadership, War, Intelligence, Politics, and Charisma. Continuously performing tasks may increase any the primary statistics. In addition to abilities, some officers may also have specific skills. Skills provide unique active or passive capabilities for the officer in mention. For example, Zhao Yun has the ""Insight"" skill which renders him immune from all enemy combat strategies.****Combat**Combat initiates immediately during each player turn. During the turn of any active player, the player may choose to move own units on the map and attack enemy land units or ships. All opponents may be attacked unless under alliance or cease fire, during which the player may also move through their territory freely.****Technical Points**Player(s) actions may reward the player with technical points. These points may then be invested in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI version of a combat technological tree, thus enabling different strengths for each faction formerly defined only by its officers.

The last evil god standing, Saruin, was imprisoned with the power of the 10 Fatestones - scattered across Mardias. One thousand years later since Saruin's imprisonment, eight adventurers face an unknown destiny against the silent growing evil awaiting to challenge the lands of Mardias once again...****Gameplay**Romancing SaGa is a 3rd perspective anime role-playing adventure game with turned-based combat. In this game, the player is 1 (one) of the possible 8 (eight) heroes/heroines available in the game. ****Each character has a different main storyline, however choosing either character does not effect much of the storyline, regardless. In addition to different main storylines, each character has a different starting class (optional) which may be altered throughout the game.****Romancing SaGa uses a non-linear storyline. Characters may travel the land regardless of any main plot. The player's party consists of a maximum of 5 characters, of which may be added or removed throughout the game at your discretion.****Gameplay of Romancing SaGa may be categorized as the following:****1. Character Development and Skills**Character development in Romancing SaGa is comprised of 2 different developments: The first is automatic statistic development where the characters ""statistically level-up"" per attribute (not per level) after each combat. The second is manual skill development where the player can trade in ""jewels"" to upgrade several skills of a character e.g. Longsword, Climbing, Search Chests, etc.****Character levels are represented by Character Class levels. Certain skills must be upgraded for a character to fulfill the requirements of that class. Each class has different traits, for example a ""Swordsman"" gains benefits in attack mode. Character classes do not effect the storyline. ****Turned-based Combat**Standard RPG turned based combat, where the uniqueness of the combat refers to automatic combo capabilities of your characters. Under certain situations, the player's characters may combine their attacks against an enemy (a combo) thus creating greater effects (in addition of visual effects).****Characters in combat throughout the course of combat may develop special weapon skills. Weapon skills may only be attained through combat through enlightenment (Glimmer). Weapon skills use BPs (Battle Points) and (sometimes) DPs (Duration Points), each weapon skill has different BPs, which are effected by the skills of a character, e.g. a character that has a level 2 skill in Longsword uses less BPs for his/her longsword weapon skill.****Another interesting feature about the weapons in regard to combat: each character may equip up to 5 weapons (optional) and may choose from those 5 different weapons at any point during combat, thus adding more tactical possibilities in combat. This reason for this may likely relate to DPs (Duration Points) of a weapon. If a DP of a weapon is used up (usually due to use of special weapon skills), the weapon breaks and is unusable during combat. It may only be repaired at a blacksmith or at an inn. ****Unlike other RPGs, all attributes of the characters (health, etc.) are automatically healed after combat. However, if a character falls during combat, their LPs (Life Points) decrease. If the LP decreases to zero, the character will die permanently. LPs are regained by resting at an inn."

RTL Biathlon 2007 (Germany)>RTL Biathlon 2007>2006>ESRB - E (Everyone)>RTL Playtainment>49Games>Sports/Skiing>2.6>1-4 Players>RTL Biathlon 2007 is a simulation of the winter biathlon sport, combining two disciplines: cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. The competition takes place on nine skiing areas. The skier moves forward by keeping a button pressed, which consumes energy. The amount of energy varies in different sections of the level (more when going downhill, less when going up), and releasing the button allows for some generation, while the skier will move slower. When overexerting the athlete, the energy levels move into orange and red, and a large amount of stamina is consumed. Other techniques include gliding (crouching when going downhill) and sprinting in certain areas. The shooting sections are shown from a first-person perspective. The accuracy depends on the remaining stamina. Players can also hold their breath to steady the rifle, but this depletes the stamina levels further.****The different game modes include Practice, Career and Multiplayer. By competing in different leagues, players earn experience points that eventually open up power points to be distributed over a number of skills. At the start of the game, players can choose a preset skier or create a custom one, determining the name, outfit and skill level. Multiplayer is available for up to four players (hot seat mode) or two in split-screen.

Like the real sport it is basically divided into two sections: skiing and shooting. During the skiing sections the player steers his athlete into the correct direction and watches his stamina. In the middle of the screen is a power bar which gets filled by holding the assigned button - if the bar is too low the athlete gets slow and if it is too high he gets tired. Practically this results in steady button pressing to keep it as high as possible. During the shooting sequences the player shoots on targets while the cursor is wobbling. He can also hold his breath for a short time to steady his aim.****In the career mode the player divides points into four categories, e.g. speed or stamina, which influence the athlethe's capabilities. After successful championships he can improve these stats further. New in this instalment are super-powers which can be chosen at some point. When activated these give a big boost on a stat for a short time, e.g. ""mountain skiing"" boosts power when skiing uphill. These are available once per race. There are overall 15 courses which are partly licensed."

The goal is to become the best athlete in the world.****The game features a optional technique analysis after every jump which shows potential points of improvement and challenges in the career mode which unlock special pieces of equipment, e.g. a perfect landing. There is also a quiz game with a few hundred questions about ski jumping.****In comparison to the 2006 version there are a few small improvements, e.g. a overhauled menu system, new graphics effects and two new camera perspectives. Also new is that the player additionally controls the balance during the braking after the landing and if the player character shows cheering or depressed gestures. The license is restricted to the 41 jumping sites and the equipment.
RTL Winter Games 2007 (Germany)>RTL Winter Games 2007>2006>ESRB - E (Everyone)>RTL Enterprises GmbH>RTL>Sports/Olympic>2.8>1-4 Players>RTL Winter Games 2007 is the successor of Torino 2006 which simulates 13 events divided into seven disciplines: alpine skiing, ski jumping, sled, biathlon, ice skating and - new in this version - curling. ****The basic handling is the same for most disciplines: steering the athlete in the right directions and pressing a button to perform an action, e.g. jumping. Two exceptions are the shooting part of the biathlon and skating: In the first the player needs to shoot targets with a wobbling cursor and the latter uses the typical rhythm game controls where arrows fly in from one side of the screen and the player needs to press the assigned button at the right time. Tactical elements are used in biathlon where the player needs to look after his fatigue and curling which is a tactical game by definition.****The single-player mode consists of different tournaments which contain seven or 15 randomly chosen disciplines. Of course the player also has the option to compile his own tournaments. Additionally there are 43 small missions where the player needs to reach a certain result from a predefined initial situation. Also new are help functions which show exactly when to press which buttons or show the ideal line of movement.
RTL Winter Sports 2009 (Germany)>RTL Winter Sports 2009>2008>ESRB - E (Everyone)>RTL>49Games>Sports>2.4>1-4 Players>"Following previous winter sports titles (including the official game of the Torino 2006 Olympic Games), 49Games presents another light simulation of some of the most popular winter sports, including alpine skiing, snowboard half-pipe, ski jump, speed skating, biathlon, luge, bobsleigh, skeleton, figure skating and curling, for a total of 18 different events.  While not as complex as the specialized games developed by the German company (there's no waxing the skis, for instance), the game features a solid physics engine, which provides more realism than some of the more arcadish approaches to the genre. Gameplay varies by event, with the player being in full control of the athlete in most events like alpine skiing and half-pipe (which plays like most radical sports games featuring tricks and flicks instead of being ""on-rails""), while other modes feature an higher focus on rhythm, like speed skating and figure skating. Curling plays like most games previously featuring the event, but there are two modes: simulation plays like the actual sport, where a team scores a point for each stone closer to the middle than the opponents' closest, while game awards points for each of the stones inside the target.  The game features three modes: Competition, where the player can participate in 5, 9 or all 16 events (or customize them), Campaign, where the player has to complete a number of quick goals to unlock additional tracks and features from previous games, while Career requires the player to compete in 15 levels with an increasing number of events to do the same. Single Events allow the player to train on any event."

Each combatant has her own repository of clothes to choose from before each match, from a wide selection of standard wrestling outfits, to a series of bikinis, used mainly for the Mud Wrestling mode in the game.****A great deal of the game revolves around the personalities of the fighters and the usage of the reputation system. Several matches will require that the player be sworn not to use dirty tactics such as using weapons found around the ring or even to humiliate the opponent. These oaths can be broken by the player, but the consequences are the loss of fan popularity and for the player's chosen character to develop a dark side to their persona.****Popularity comes into play in the game, not only as a statistical boost for the player, but also as an actual aide in combat when the player finds the audience cheering and helping their character to win the match. Much like similar wrestling/fighting titles such as Def Jam: Fight for NY, this sort of help can be a difference maker in a close match.

Samurai Shodown V (Europe)>Samurai Shodown V>2006>ESRB - E10+ (Everyone 10+)>SNK Playmore Corp.>SNK>Fighter>3.6>1-2 Players>Seven years after the fourth game in the series, Samurai Shodown returns. In the game's time frame, this is the earliest game, hence the Japanese title Samurai Spirits Zero. It takes place in 1786 from January through the later summer. The game is therefore considered a prequel to the series.****The overall gameplay was slightly altered. It is a little faster, and the Slash/Bust system has been removed. Each character now has only one version, or the Bust mode is simply replaced by a new character of very similar setup. Combo slashes, sidestepping and fatalities have also vanished. The basic moves have been modeled after the first games in the series. They consist of three types of slashes, a single kick, and various dodge maneuvers similar to Samurai Shodown II.****There are 24 characters, a familiar cast with some new faces. Unlike the previous games, it is not possible to kill your opponent.
Samurai Warriors - Xtreme Legends (USA)>Samurai Warriors - Xtreme Legends>2004>ESRB - T (Teen)>KOEI Corporation>Omega Force>Beat-'Em-Up>4>1-2 Players>As the inevitable expansion pack for the first Samurai Warriors game, Xtreme Legends adds four new characters, a new campaign, more weapons and items, and gameplay tweaks.  Although it can be played standalone, half the point is to replay the original Samurai Warriors for the new content.  SW:XL also contains an archive feature, to learn more about the characters and history.
Samurai Warriors (USA)>Samurai Warriors>2004>ESRB - T (Teen)>KOEI Co., Ltd.>Omega Force>Beat-'Em-Up>3.4>1-2 Players>"Samurai Warriors is Koei's extension of the popular Dynasty Warriors series.  Instead of taking place during the Three Kingdoms era in China, Samurai Warriors takes you back to feudal Japan, during the warring states era.  In the game, you take control of actual historical figures such as Yukimura Sanada, Nobunaga Oda, and Hattori Hanzo.  Altogether, there are fifteen characters, ten of whom need to be unlocked.****Basically, gameplay is almost identical to that of Dynasty Warriors.  The main differences are things like the inclusion of indoor castle levels, and a greater variety of enemies.  In Dynasty Warriors, enemies were basically either soldiers or archers.  In Samurai Warriors, there are soldiers, archers, musketeers, and many different types of ninjas.  In terms of story, there are basically only five levels, but depending on your actions in a certain level specific to each character, the story will branch of into two different stories, leading to a good ending or a not as good ending.  Updated graphics and a more ""techno-ish"" soundtrack top off the additions."

Similar to the other Empires games, it adds turn-based empire-building gameplay to the mix.  Although battles are still fought using the same 3rd-person button mashing mechanics that the Samurai Warriors-style games are known for, players now must also choose the battles to maximize the growth of their burgeoning empire in Japan's Warring States era. In the Empire mode there are several historical battles available.****The game also adds two previously unplayable characters, Shibata Katsuie and Sasaki Kojiro, as well as a Create Your Own Character mode.

As with the original Samurai Warriors, Samurai Warriors 2 is based on the Japanese Sengoku or ""Warring States"" period, a time of social upheaval, political intrigue, and nearly constant military conflict in Japan that lasted roughly from the middle of the 15th century to the beginning of the 17th century.****The game is a third person hack-and-slash. You have 26 playable characters to choose from. Once you choose your character you are tossed into massive real-time battles, with the object being to help claim victory for your army by defeating key enemy officers, or simply slaying a large amount of enemy troops, which will boost the morale of your army, and turn the tides of the battle. ****10 new warriors are added from the previous game including the legendary Musashi Miyamoto, the unifier of Japan Ieyasu Tokugawa, and the enigmatic ninja Kotaro Fuma. Each warrior has his own unique move set and techniques. Set traps, summon ninja decoys, and more. Use powerful Linked Charge attacks and power up to three Musou gauges.

His journey takes him to a corrupt town ruled by a sinister land baron named Goldberg.  Though Gojiro isn't interested in righting wrongs, he is soon caught up in the town's problems: killing highway robbers, protecting a woman from would-be rapists, and thwarting Goldberg's machinations.  Focused on destroying Gojiro, Goldberg unleashes an endless stream of minions... all fodder for Gojiro's blade.  But Goldberg has an ace up his sleeve...****Samurai Western is a third-person action game.  Gojiro's blade is more than a match for Old West weaponry as he can ably deflect or sidestep bullets.  As Gojiro completes levels, he upgrades his skills, unlocks new swords and stances, and adds Western accessories to his wardrobe.  Primarily a single-player game, Samurai Western has a two player co-op mode and unlockable characters for both modes.

In fact, arcade action is the order of the day here, and while the real SAS, GIGN and GSG9 are busy with discreet, minimal casualty operations, here you'll be blasting away with aplomb.

But Tony wouldn't be Tony Montana if he would just give up, so it is the player's goal to reclaim Miami once again. To do so, he has to earn money and respect.

Once this is full he can enter a kind of god mode in which he is invulnerable and has unlimited ammo. Tony also gets health when killing someone in this mode. If he is driving a car he gets balls when making stunts like driving on the wrong side of the road or dodging an incoming car.****As in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, the player is free to roam the city of Miami and there are also some side-missions with racing events."

Desperate for survival, King Abelard summons, Allerion, a masked knight, to the aid of Bylandria. In order to save the king's kingdom, Allerion must travel through a vast array of lands to finally bring down The Grand Inquisitor and his army once and for all.  Shifters is a third person RPG set in the Might and Magic universe. This is a typical RPG with a slight twist.

In addition to the three level up categories (mind, body, soul), you can choose to level up your shifted forms in order to make them more powerful and unlock different classes.

They have mastered the secret of devil summoning - call forth beasts from hell and make them fight against their own kind, on your side. This unique ability was transferred from parent to child over generations. ****It is the Taishou era in Japan: the First World War is over, and the country enters rapid industrialization, growing to become one of the leading economies in the world. You play as the fourteenth Raidou Kuzunoha, and one seemingly ordinary case makes you confront a demon. That's where your newly discovered devil-summoning skills come in handy. After defeating your first demonic enemy and summoning your first allies, you are determined to explore the city, to solve supernatural cases, and to find the truth behind the demons' presence.****This is the third entry in the Devil Summoner sub-series of the Megaten franchise. Unlike the two previous games, ""Raidou Kuzunoha"" incorporates action combat into the traditional demon-summoning system. You can still capture and summon various demons, but they will be controlled by AI (which you can configure) during battles. You have physical control over Raidou Kuzunoha; although the battles take place on separate screens, like in usual turn-based Asian RPGs, you can move freely and attack enemies in real time. You can use sword or gun attacks, and also perform different moves such as dashing and striking the opponent. You can also defend by pressing buttons at the correct time. Outside of battles, you will have to do a lot of detective work: walking around the city, talking to suspects, hunting for information, etc. Some demon abilities can also be used outside of combat to gain advantage in your investigation."

Once again, the player takes the role of Raidou Kuzunoha the 14th, the youngest in the long line of devil summoners. It is the Taishou period (the 1920-ies) in Japan, and once again the Capital City is threatened by supernatunal forces. Raidou works undercover at the Narumi Detective Agency, solving cases with mysterious backgrounds. It all begins when a young woman enters the office and asks the detective to find a missing man...****The game is part of the larger series dedicated to generations of devil summoners, which, in its turn, is a part of the meta-series Megaten. As in the first Raidou Kuzunoha game, the core gameplay is action-oriented. Raidou attacks enemies with swords or guns; but like before, he will need help from his demonic allies to defeat the foes. Raidou is able to summon two (as opposed to one in the first game) demons to help him in battles. The main gameplay difference is that instead of simply weakening enemies to capture them, as it was the case in the first game, now Raidou has to talk to hostile demons and persuade them to join his party, thus returning to the long-running Megaten tradition of demon negotiations as integral part of gameplay.

This is when Serph's quest truly begins.****""Digital Devil Saga"" is a part of  Megaten game universe, related to  Shin Megami Tensei and  Persona. Unlike all other Megaten games, you can't communicate with random enemies (demons) by talking to them, and also can't summon them in battles. Instead, Serph and his party are able to turn into demons themselves. During the round-based combat, the characters can fight as demons or as humans (using guns). The most important combat element is the ability to devour defeated foes. Each devoured enemy adds to your karma points, which can later be assigned to learn various skills."

He and his friends have finally reached Nirvana... yet it turned out to be something entirely different from the paradise they have imagined. It appears that the struggle continues in Nirvana itself, and the path to the True World is not yet unlocked...****The sequel utilizes the same gameplay mechanics as the first game.

You play as a high-school student in modern Tokyo. One day you go to visit your teacher in a hospital. Unable to find her, you encounter a strange man in the basement, and soon thereafter witness the event of great destruction - the Conception. The world around the young man changes drastically, as monsters invade it, and the high demonic powers of the universe make it to the arena of their eternal fight - the struggle between Law and Chaos. Will the hero be able to find his path within this cosmic battle, even at the cost of losing his human nature?****Just like the two previous Shin Megami Tensei games, ""SMT: Nocturne"" allows you to communicate with random enemies and to recruit them into your party. The fights are turn-based, and are viewed from third-person perspective, unlike in earlier SMT games. The exploration of 3D dungeons is also done from over-the-shoulder view. True to the spirit of SMT series, you can choose your own moral path in the game, siding with one of the struggling forces, or fighting against both. New in this enhanced version (compared to the Japanese-only ""Shin Megami Tensei III"") are: additional items and monsters, optional dungeons, two difficulty levels, an extra ending (in additional to the other five possible), and the appearance of Dante, the popular character from  Devil May Cry series."

As a result, you discover within yourself the gift to call upon a higher being, Persona, that grants you immense power. Your new ability makes you decide to investigate the strange world of shadows that has been plaguing the city every midnight, and to find out who or what is behind it.****This sequel in the  Persona series, which is part of the huge  Megaten franchise, is not directly connected to its predecessors story-wise. The gameplay has also underwent significant changes, throwing an element of ""school simulation"" into the already unusual Megaten RPG formula. You get to live the life of a normal high-school student: you attend classes, talk to your friends, get homework, wait for the summer vacation, and so on. The game is divided into school days with their own schedule.****However, at midnight the real world freezes, and only you and your friends with the unique Persona abilities can feel the time flowing as they battle the shadows. The battles follow the classic Megaten model of demon-summoning. You can either attack with your weapons, or call a mighty Persona from within yourself. After the battle is won, you receive Persona cards, which can be fused to get more powerful Personae. Inspired by the system used in  Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne, you are able to hit enemies' weakpoints with your magic spells.

The main storyline follows this mystery of the kidnappings.****   The fourth installment of Persona has many similarities to Persona 3. You can build social links for different characters, which are represented by tarot cards. Raising the rank of these social links increases the potency of the ""personae"" associated with them.

When a shot is performed particularly well, players are rewarded with a 'bullet cam' which follows the bullet in slow-motion from gun barrel to target.****The game also includes a multi-player mode with a number of different game types.

Snoopy vs. the Red Baron (USA)>Snoopy vs. the Red Baron>2006>ESRB - E10+ (Everyone 10+)>Namco Bandai Games America Inc.>Smart Bomb Interactive>Flying>3.9>1-2 Players>"As Snoopy sleeps atop his doghouse, the player is transported into his dreams about the adventures of his alter ego, the ""World Famous WWI Flying Ace."" The rest of the Peanuts characters are woven into his dream - and thereby the game's narrative - as they pass by the sleeping beagle. Lucy Van Pelt becomes the commander of the Allied forces, Linus and Sally take humorous turns as intelligence officers, while poor Charlie Brown is characteristically cast as a janitor in an Allied airbase. The story moves quickly after Charlie Brown is captured by the Red Baron's minions along with the plans for a secret weapon that could change the course of the war. Snoopy and his co-pilot Woodstock take to the skies in his trusty Sopwith Camel to recover the plans and rescue Snoopy’s hapless owner.****The game mechanics center around third-person action adventure flight in contexts such as aerial races, dogfighting missions, and world exploration. Collectible items in the world unlock plane and weapon upgrades, as well as new character/plane combinations for use in versus multiplayer aerial combat. Hardcore Peanuts fans will recognize the front lines at Verdun, the woods of Montsec and Verdon Gorge as the settings for Snoopy’s original Flying Ace adventures in the comic strip by Charles M. Schulz. The game features 7 of these locations, which often change considerably from mission to mission.****The flight model for Snoopy's Sopwith Camel and the other planes in the game leans heavily towards the fanciful arcade end of the realism spectrum. Controls and collision are forgiving and approachable for younger players, although advanced stunts such as barrel rolls and Immelmans are accessible through button combos for experienced aficionados of the air combat genre. The game includes boss sequences that offer novel variations on its core mechanics. For example, players will battle a flotilla of submarines as Woodstock, being towed behind Snoopy's plane in a toy balsa-wood glider. Here the mechanics are those of a rail shooter, with Snoopy pulling the player along a path while the player contends with a multi-stage boss fight.****Pre-rendered cut scenes advance the narrative between missions as the player returns to a ""hub world"" represented by Charlie Brown's neighborhood. Here the player can upgrade his plane and weapons at Pig-Pen's Shop or complete a series of tutorials at Marcie's Flight School. The music and voiceovers in these sequences recall the classic Peanuts holiday specials that have been an annual fixture of American television since 1965."

Space Invaders Anniversary (Europe)>Space Invaders Anniversary>2004>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Empire Interactive Entertainment>Taito Corporation>Shoot-'Em-Up>2.9>1-2 Players>25 years after Space Invaders was released, Taito has decided to bring us a special anniversary edition that includes all the versions of Space Invaders that were ever released in the arcades, plus two extra game modes. These include:****1. Space Invaders - monochrome version: The original, as first appeared in 1978. Move your ship left or right, shooting at oncoming invaders, while dodging theirs. Shoot the flying saucer that goes across the screen for extra points. Four barriers protect you from invaders' shots, but will be destroyed after several hits. Once you shoot every invader on screen, you have to do it again and again. The game ends when all lives are lost.****2. Space Invaders - color version: Same version as above, but in color.****3. Space Invaders - cellophane version: Five strips of cellophane (cyan, green, yellow, blue, red) are placed across the game screen, in an attempt to block out the two black areas.****4. Space Invaders - upright version: Space Invaders in color, but a background has been added, and contains a planet and some stars.****5. Space Invaders doubles: Two players can play at the same time. Lives are separate, so if one players loses all their lives, the other keeps on playing.****6. Space Invaders Part II: Known as Space Invaders Deluxe in the US. The differences between the original and this game is that there are two different flying saucers: one is steadily visible and another blinks. Different points are awarded for each one that is killed. Also, from wave two onwards, invaders can be split into two when shot, and the flying saucers drop alien reinforcements. Also available as a cocktail cabinet.****2. Space Invaders VS: Two-player game. The screen is split is split into two, with each side reserved for each player. Invaders occupy both sides. The object of the game is to kill these invaders, so that you can destroy the ship at the top of the screen that belongs to your opponent. Matches are determined before the start of the game. You can have a CPU opponent.****7. Space Invaders 3D: Everything on screen appears in 3D. Instead of bullets, not only do invaders shoot arrows at you, but they can launch fireballs at you. You lose a life when you come in contact with these. As always, flying saucers go across the screen, but will then fly directly toward you. When these saucers are hit, you automatically receive a power-up that will help you kill the invaders.****Before you start each game, you can adjust the view of which you can play. One view shows the cabinet as it is played as if you are standing in front of the machine itself, while another allows you to play the game in full-screen mode. The sounds of Space Invaders serves as the background music, but this can be changed to music from various Taito games, such as Bubble Bobble, Elevator Action, The Fairyland Story, Darius, and several others. Other options let you choose the number of lives to start off with and adjust the number of points needed to gain extra lives.****Along with the games, you can also view promotional material, as well as any development sheets for the original game.

Starsky & Hutch are actually shooting a TV show, and the scoring for each mission reflects how ratings-friendly your driving is. You are awarded gold, silver or bronze medals for each mission depending on performance, and must get at least 1 gold and 2 silvers on season 1 for a second season to be commissioned, and 3 golds and 2 silvers in season 2 for there to be a third for you to play through.****The overall goal in each mission is usually to chase and destroy a criminal's car. There is always a secondary target as well. In addition, the player will gain viewers by hitting the bad guy, pulling off elaborate jumps and skids, nearly hitting civilians, and hitting the bonus targets such as canisters which are strewn through the levels. Hitting civilians will lose viewers.****Dave Starsky is the guy behind the steering wheel and Ken 'Hutch' Hutchinson shoots out of the windows of the car. On PS2 and XBox a second player can take care of the shooting, using either a light gun or a standard controller. During single player, the aiming is automatic for shooting.

Alternatively, three separate buttons for low, medium and heavy fire can be pressed.****If a player destroys an enemy, a multiplier is applied from 1x to 256x depending on how heavy the fire power applied was. However, some enemies drop stars which also have a multiplier of 1x to 256x attached to them. Here the scale is reversed, not firing at all while collecting the stars gives the highest multiplier.

Sword of Etheria, The (Europe)>Sword of Etheria, The>2006>ESRB - E10+ (Everyone 10+)>Konami Digital Entertainment Co., Ltd.>KCET>Beat-'Em-Up>3.7>1 Player>"Originally released as OZ (Over Zenith) in Japan, The Sword of Etheria is a single-player, 3rd person, role playing game with anime type graphics in a fantasy setting. Although some character names have been borrowed from The Wizard of Oz, the similarity ends there.  The hero and main character is Fiel (""Feel"" in the Japanese version), a boy who lost his parents at a young age and was raised by his sister Dorothy. Although they are human, Fiel and Dorothy can tap into their world's magical power, Etheria. Toto, their special cat, is able to transform itself into a sword. The brother and sister share their ability with the Katina, spiritual creatures captured and employed by evil gods to tyrannize mankind. Feel frees two Katina (Almira and Leon) and they join with him on his quest to vanquish the evil gods, rescue their world and reclaim the life-giving power of Etheria.  The story unfolds during 20 chapters called ""stages"". Gameplay includes exploration of the world in a free-roaming style, conversations with NPCs and party members. Objects and animals in the environment can be destroyed to find valuable items. Combat relies heavily on teamwork and how well the player works with the AI-controlled companions. Attack combinations during battle involve passing an enemy back and forth between party members. The more adept the player becomes in handling the chained combat moves, the more bonuses and rankings can be gained.  Each character can be equipped with various armor, weaponry, and enchanted items like rings and necklaces. Items are found or can be purchased within the game.  Dialog choices during gameplay effect the ""affection"" value of Almira and Leon. A partner with a higher ranking in this area will chain up your combo/pass more frequently. There are at least three different endings which are determined by which mode you are playing as well as your dialog choices.  The game features Easy, Normal and Hard difficulty modes. The main difference between these modes is the amount and types of enemies that appear, items found in chests and dropped by enemies, and the respawn rate in some boss battles.  In Story Mode, only Feel can be controlled until later stages when another one of the trio can be selected. Unlockables are only available after completing the game in this mode and include bonus stages, special items, costumes, characters and a gallery with music, sounds and images."

The Japanese release is mostly the same, including keeping the game completely in English, but switches out a few of the tracks (particularly the TV show themes) for songs recognizable to Japanese audiences, such as We Will Rock You, I'm A Slave 4 U, and I Was Born To Love You.

It stars Tak (the hero from the first two games) and his brother Lok. The story is about how the people in Tak's village have set up a course of events for people to compete in. The game is a mixture of platforming and adventure. Tak and Lok have entered the event in hopes of winning. Introduced to this game is the ability to swap between characters with the touch of a butto or in 2 player mode you can play together in split screen. **The characters have to reach various checkpoints to extend the level. All the levels take place in the various jungle settings of Tak's Village. The events consist of swimming, racing, climbing ropes, and other endurance challenges.****Tak is the magic user while Lok is the brawn. During the game, the two characters provide comical banter with each other. Tak can use a chicken suit to fly and a lobster suit to swim underwater. The cutscenes are in real time.

While it is still a 3D platform game, it is more focused on puzzles and combat as opposed to collecting items.  In earlier stages, Tak must use animals to his advantage as he makes his way through levels - for example, a bear can be used as a trampoline, Tak can ride warthogs after being sprayed by skunks to mask his scent, and more.  Jibolba is along for the ride, but has transformed into a flea for easy transport.  As a result, you can throw him at enemies to bite them and make them sleepy.****Later on, Tak gains the power to transform into various animals himself.  As a frog he can swim without being eaten by crocodiles, he can soar on air currents as a flying squirrel, and can break through barriers by charging through as a warthog.  When Tak gains the titular Staff of Dreams as he progresses through the game, he can also create more powerful attacks using his magic, or ""juju""."

Although the game's features differ across platforms, most notably from next-gen to current-gen, it has a few things in common across the board: more licensed players, more courses, more game modes, and improved GameFace character creation.****Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on Xbox 360 and PS3 feature more realistic characters thanks to the all-new Universal Capture (UCAP) technology. UCAP is the same technique that was used on The Matrix films to generate digital doubles for the lead actors. Another next-gen-only feature that the Xbox 360 and PS3 share is larger crowds and mass movement of spectators from hole-to-hole, as well as PIP cameras. There is also an enhanced career mode where you can master your skills in a new Practice Facility. The golfers have a new animation state engine that yields more pertinent emotions and reactions based on what happens in gameplay. The game setup has been changed, with different swing styles, and the Speed Golf setting which allows players to skip to the next shot after the ball has been struck without watching where the ball lands.****PS2 and Xbox versions of the game feature a new team tour mode where you can recruit your own squad of golfers to go up against Team Tiger Woods. The PC, PS2, and Xbox versions have the most licensed golfers (21) in the game. The Wii edition of the game features the ability to control your swing using the Wiimote.

Further customizations include clothing, hair or eye color and more. The initial statistics can be improved by completing challenges based on power or putting precision. They can also be raised by performing well in the PGA Tour, taking into account skill shots and not just the overall ranking. Players can unlock additional golfers and spend their winnings in the shop on new equipment.****The game incorporates the FedExCup championship format (a collection of tournaments) with rounds of golf at Westchester Country Club, TPC Boston, Cog Hill, and East Lake. The putt preview has been improved, allowing the player to simulate the ball's path once per individual spot, taking into accounts elements such as power, speed and elevation. On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but with the 3-point timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player's performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.****The multiplayer (up to 4 players) has been expanded with GamerNet, where players can create and play custom challenges with their scores posted online (Xbox 360/PS3/Windows).****On the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off. It can be used to influence air conditions, spin, or adds audio distractions.

In Full Swing, twisting the wii remote adds hooks and slices prior to shots. Also exclusive to the Wii is a Miniputt mode.

Hide behind your shield to avoid being shot, but you are also not able to shoot while behind it. ****The PS2 port can use the G-con 45 and G-Con2 light guns (with the last one being bundled sometimes with the game). Another different of the PS2 port from the arcade one is that the port features an extra mission (Grassmarket District that takes place 6 months after the Garland Square mission in which you have to rescue the daughter of S.T.F. Commander Kessler and clear the district from the remaining terrorists), along with some small minigames.

Leonardo returns from his meditation in South America to find his family in disarray, and crime on the rise in New York.  A mysterious figure calling himself the ""Nightwatcher"" has turned up, and a shadowy rich man named Winters seems to be in cahoots with the remnants of the Foot Clan.  Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets!****TMNT is an action game, similar to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.  Play as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello, swapping on the fly and using special co-operative moves to help your brothers in battle.  Each turtle, being a ninja, can perform moves like double jumping, running along and up walls, gripping onto tiny cracks in the walls, and jumping from wall to wall to scale dizzying heights.  Most of the game is spent making your way to the next destination by using your ninja moves to explore New York.  Each character also has their own special move: Leo can traverse through walls, Raph can use his Sais to scale particular surfaces, Mikey can use his Nunchucks as helicopters to float for a short period, and Don can pole vault across long gaps with his Bo Staff.****Sometimes, battles will occur - in these situations, you'll be locked in an arena and must battle all your enemies before you can move on.  Battling is a simple affair - you can use one button for standard attacks (charge it for a more powerful one), and another button for light attacks that push enemies away.  If your fellow turtles are with you, you can also hold down your character swap button for a tandem co-op attack.  Some levels will allow you to play as the Nightwatcher - he fights similarly to the Turtles, except that as the more he fights, the more his 'rage' builds, which can cause a devastating surrounding attack when fully charged.  The Wii version of the game controls similarly to all other versions, except that gestures are used for attacking instead of button presses.****The basic goal for each level is to get to the end.  At the end of each level, you're graded on the following attributes: your speed, your combat, and the amount of coins collected.  In levels where you work with your brothers, you'll also be graded on how well you worked together.  Succeed in a these attributes, and you'll earn turtle coins which can be used to purchase unlockables.  If you get an A Rank or higher in a level, you'll also unlock a Challenge Map, which can be played to earn even more turtle coins.  Finally, once you've played any level at least once, turtle coins will appear in hard-to-reach spots for you to collect."

Once again, you play as Domingo 'Ding' Chavez, leading a small commando team on black-ops missions.

In certain missions, you play as sniper Dieter Weber, picking off terrorists from higher ground and providing cover while the team infiltrates the building.****The differences between the console versions are the number of missions and the availability of certain gadgets.

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3 (USA)>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3>2004>ESRB - M (Mature)>Ubisoft Entertainment SA>Ubisoft Shanghai>Shooter>3.5>1-2 Players>In 2007, an unidentified group of terrorists attack a number of high-profile targets, beginning with the G8 summit in Switzerland and continuing with a Venezuelan oil refinery in the Caribbean. Their demands are obviously targeted at disrupting the oil trade between the United States and Venezuela. Enter veteran international anti-terrorism unit Team Rainbow, who must stop the terrorists and discover who is behind the attacks.  Rainbow Six 3 is an entry in the long-running series designed especially for consoles. It does away with the heavy strategy and planning elements the series was known for on the PC and offers an experience more focused on the first-person action. The game features 14 single-player levels (15 in the PS2 and GameCube versions). In each, the player controls Domingo 'Ding' Chavez, who leads a team of three other Rainbow operatives. Goals in each mission include taking out terrorists, defusing bombs and protecting hostages. Ding's squad mates will act on their own in supporting the mission, but they can also be given specific orders through a context-sensitive menu: holding position, advancing, clearing a room or defusing a bomb. It's also possible to give delayed orders which are only carried out once a special signal is given. The Xbox version features voice recognition: team orders can be given through a headset.  Before each mission, each squad member must be equipped with a primary and secondary weapon plus further equipment. More than two dozen realistic firearms are available, and there are also different types of grenades (hand-thrown or fired through a launcher), charges and mines, as well as a gas mask. Thermal and night vision are always available and don't require special equipment.  Despite the action focus, the game still opts for a certain amount of realism: there is no running or jumping, more than a few hits are fatal and there is no way to regain lost health.  Besides the single player campaign, there is also the custom mission mode, which allows the player to hunt terrorists on unlocked maps from the campaign. 
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell - Chaos Theory (USA)>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell - Chaos Theory>2005>ESRB - M (Mature)>Ubisoft, Inc.>Ubisoft Montreal>Action>3.3>1-2 Players>Set in the not too distant future, Japan creates the Information Self-Defense Force (I-SDF). The creation of this force is seen as a violation of international law and Japan's constitution, and it causes tensions to rise between Japan, China, and North Korea. In time, North Korea and China set up shipping blockades around Japan, and Japan calls on the United States for help, citing article nine of the Postwar Constitution. Throughout this time, Japan uncovers more and more information that the infamous Black Gold Day was caused by intentional information warfare attacks. As the U.S. prepares to launch the USS Clarence E. Walsh, Third Echelon sends the famous Sam Fisher on a mission that appears to be unrelated to the incident, but which may end up being the most important element of it all.****In Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, players take on the role of field operative Sam Fisher for a third outing. Fisher has some new moves this time around, and he also has a new weapon always at his disposal; a combat knife. Utilizing the knife, Sam can either kill his enemies, or simply knock them out. At the end of each mission, the player is given an overview of how they did. The more people that the player spares, the better the success score.****The single-player game is more open-ended than the past two Splinter Cell games. While players are still forced through some areas in a &quot;tunnel&quot; like fashion, with no choice of where to go, there are many instances where they can decide how they'd like to get there. For example, in the caverns, one can either kill two enemies and cross the bridge, or leave them alone, sneak along the side path, and climb a ladder at the end, bypassing the fight entirely, but still winding up in the same location.****Throughout the game many different locations are visited, such as a lighthouse, a Japanese tea house, Seoul, New York City during an East Coast blackout, and other such exotic locales.****The Spies-vs-Mercs multiplayer mode that appeared in the previous game has returned, with some new features. There are several new, large maps to play on, as well as updated versions from the past game. The PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox versions feature this mode.
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell - Double Agent (USA)>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell - Double Agent>2006>ESRB - M (Mature)>Ubisoft Entertainment SA>Ubisoft Montreal>Action>4.4>1-2 Players>Once, Sam Fisher was an agent of Third Echelon, assigned to infiltrate strongholds belonging to enemies of National Security, gather information and neutralize enemies if needed.****Times are changing, America's enemies are looking at new options, finding ways to make themselves more deadly. In order to star one step ahead of its target, Third Echelon is also changing and while Sam Fisher's foes are evolving and his allies are in flux, Fisher's own life will undergo some dramatic and permanent changes. And once that happens nothing will ever be the same.****With his life turned upside down, Fisher is on a new mission unlike any he has ever been sent on before. Where he used to penetrate defenses and gather information from the outside, now he is on the inside, working with those he has sworn to destroy and finding enemies among his allies. He is risking everything for the sake of the greater good, even if it costs him his identity or his life.****Play the game in a stealth manner or in a gun blazing way and your experience will be different every time you play. Try to sneak around the enemies and kill, interrogate or neutralize them without anyone else notice. There are 3 different endings depending on your choices in the game. Different settings will be visited during the game such as a prison, a boat in Cozumel, visit Africa, and many more.****You will get many different weapons and gadgets to help you through your journey. Use gadgets to close the lights, use gadget to electrify enemies in water pond, and scan the surroundings using your many visions (electric, night vision, heat vision) to identify potential gameplay objects around the worlds.****This version is quite different from the Xbox 360/Windows release. They share the same engine (although it is not multi-threaded), but this release adds an additional single-player mission with alternate ending, a new Spies vs. Spies online mode, 14 co-op missions playable offline (also online for the Xbox version), LAN, and 8 minutes of additional cinematics. There are also some changes in the storyline. The Wii/GameCube versions only have co-op multiplayer.****The Spies vs. Spies multiplayer offers different game modes:****1. Team Hack: similar to capture the flag, but you need to hack the opponent's computer and secure your own.****2. Deathmatch: regular matches.****3. Team Deathmatch: regular team matches.****4. Key Run: similar to Team Hack, but with the addition of a key that needs to be obtained first to hack into the opponent's computer****5. Sam Vs. All: a single player, Sam Fisher, has to sneakily hack into computers defended by an entire team.****6. Countdown: similar to Deathmatch, with the addition of gameplay time provided by killing other players.

He makes daily phone calls to an undisclosed location every day, delaying the release of the disease by one more day.  As Fisher, you must find out who the terrorist is, where he is, who he is working for, and above all, stop him.****In order to do this, you are taken all around the world, from Paris to Indonesia to the holy land Jerusalem.  Sam comes equipped with his standard pistol and SC-20K.  The SC has been improved, with an added scope with two levels of zoom.  You have access to all the equipment from the first game, including Sticky Shockers, Diversion Cameras, Frag and Smoke Grenades.****Sam has also learned some new moves.  He has the ability to perform a SWAT turn, which allows him to pass from one side of an open door to the other without being spotted.  He may perform a half-split jump, enabling him to lean against one side of a wall to give him boost to jump higher.  He can also whistle, to attract the attention of any nearby enemies.****Pandora Tomorrow also has a full fledged multiplayer game, playable on Xbox Live.  The multiplayer ties in to the single player campaign, and it pits the Shadownet team (spies) against the Argus team (mercs).  The game supports four players.****Members of Shadownet must infiltrate various complexes to retrieve canisters of a deadly liquid, but they must watch out for cameras, motion sensors and trip lasers, all of which alert the mercs to their position.  The spy cannot kill with weapons, but he can stun the mercs for several seconds in order to sneak up and kill from behind.****On the other side, the mercs must make their way to each canister, guarding it from the Shadownet team.  Whenever an alarm is tripped, the merc is instantly alerted to where the spy is.  To help fight the Shadownets, the mercs have a built-in motion sensor view, which picks up any moving objects, as well as an electromagnetic view, which picks up on spy gadgets.  The mercs come equipped with a rifle, and must defend the viral canisters at all costs.****Multiplayer comes with a good variety of maps, ranging from a warehouse and a factory to a cinema and three towering skyscrapers.  More maps will be available in the future via Xbox Live.

Third Echelon is a secret organization, a part of the U.S. government.  The organization deals with very sensitive missions, and you play as Sam, Third Echelon's ""splinter cell"".  Your missions are so discreet, that if you are captured, the government will deny any such existence of that organization.****Since it's a stealth based game, you have a variety of moves at your disposal.  You can walk, run, crouch, jump, rappel, shimmy, cross horizontal wires, zip using a zip cord, and do a split jump.****To defeat your enemies, you have a variety of means.  You can use your weapons, but the noise might alert a guard.  You can stun them, kill them, subdue them, jump down from the ceiling and knock them unconcious.  Some enemies are needed to activate a door or passcode, so you can take an enemy hostage by holding a gun to his head, you can interrogate them, or you can use them as human shields.****Some of the more innovative features of the game is the ability to peak through a door before going through.  You can open it up a bit to peak through, or you can use your optic cable camera (a ""snake"" camera) to peer through the underside of the door, checking to make sure it's clear.****Being a stealth based game, your arsenal is small.  You have an automatic rifle that can be fitted with a silencer and other modifications, and you also have a trusty pistol.****Splinter Cell also has downloadable content, so you can download new items in the future, specifically new levels and missions."
Tomb Raider - Anniversary (USA)>Tomb Raider - Anniversary>2007>ESRB - T (Teen)>Eidos Interactive>Crystal Dynamics>Action>4>1 Player>A mighty syndicate gives Lara Croft the task to find the Scion, a mystical artifact which is said to be the key to the secret of Atlantis. Since her father already searched for this item, Lara does not hesitate and begins her journey through ancient tombs and forgotten worlds.****Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary is essentially a remake of the original Tomb Raider. So you fight and riddle your way through familiar sites and meet good old enemies. But also you feel at home, the game features everything that Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend has. So besides the better graphics, Lara also has many new moves, such as swinging on ropes, bullet time when an animal rushes towards her, and the addition of a grappling hook in her inventory (which resembles the one from the original game). Jumping is also a lot easier, as the heroine automatically grabs the ledges without requiring pixel-precise timing. There are also completely new moves,  where Lara balances and jumps on small sticks.****The cut-scenes are identical, but rendered in real-time using the new engine. Some are also action-based, like in the previous games, requiring quick reflexes to keep the action going. The environments and riddles have been changed to fit the new gameplay and the voice recording was also redone.
Tomb Raider - Legend (USA)>Tomb Raider - Legend>2006>ESRB - T (Teen)>Eidos Interactive>Crystal Dynamics>Action>4>1 Player>Legend is the seventh major game in the Tomb Raider series, now for the first time developed by Crystal Dynamics, along with the original character designer of the game's protagonist Lara Croft: Toby Gard.****Heroine Lara is searching for a South American relic, but her adventure takes a different course when rogue anthropologist Amanda Evert shows up. Presumed dead along with a team of graduate students after an accident in a tomb in Peru, where Lara was the only one to escape, Amanda is back with a score to settle as they both race, along with the shady James Rutland Jr., to obtain an ancient artifact. Many other characters, both friends and foes, will stir things up. The story takes Lara through locations all over the world, from the Himalayas to Ghana, Kazakhstan, Bolivia, Japan and England, including her famous mansion filled with secrets and collectibles. Aside from current events, Lara's past is also revealed, through flashbacks. Among other things, you will get to know how she lost her mother and why it is such a burden.****The typical third-person action-adventuring exploring is still present. Lara can move more freely, and is no longer limited by specific jumps. As you travel through rough environments, you will need to run, dive, swim, climb on poles, ladders, roofs, use zip lines, shimmy and vault, with acrobatic actions such as somersaults and flips. You need to cross difficult terrain, solve puzzles to advance or open up new areas, and engage in combat. New tools include a grappling hook, not only used to move around but also to haul enemies Scorpion-style, binoculars, a PLS (personal light source), flares, a PDA and a headset to keep in contact with tech support Zip.****Enemies are still rather scarce. Both humans and animals will attack you, and the game retains the auto lock-on mode, but now with a slide attack and close combat with both kicks and punches, plus bullet-time actions to get behind enemies quickly. Lara carries her trademark dual-wielded pistols, but can also pick up new weapons along the way, such as a shotgun and grenades. Missions take place in both indoor and outdoor environments, with arcade motorcycle and jeep sequences in between. As usual, Lara has a fancy outfit for each location.****The PSP version includes the full game and adds a multiplayer mode: Tomb Trials. You can race another player through tombs to see who comes out first, or go on a timed scavenger hunt for artifacts.
Tomb Raider - Underworld (USA)>Tomb Raider - Underworld>2009>ESRB - T (Teen)>Eidos Interactive Ltd.>Crystal Dynamics>Action>4.1>1 Player>Tomb Raider: Underworld concludes the story of Lara's search for her mother who is supposedly trapped in a place called Avalon. Continuing the events from Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend and Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary, her search brings her once again to locations around the globe from the cold wastes of the Arctic to the beautiful landscapes of Thailand. This time even the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea is not save from Lara's exploring. At the same time the game continues to explore the idea of monomyth, this time incorporating the influences of the Norse mythology into its narrative.****The basic gameplay remains the same as in most of the previous iterations of the series with the focus on exploring, solving riddles and dodgy climbing passages instead of instant action and gun fights. For this Lara once again learned a few new moves including jumping between the walls introduced in Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time.****To help the players with the riddles, the game not only features a sonar map, showing Lara's immediate surroundings as a 3D grid for better orientation around the levels. Also, if asked, Lara gives general but helpful tips on what to do next.****The differences from the previous Tomb Raider games developed by Crystal Dynamics include the complete lack of QTE events. Instead the time slows down in critical moments, but the player still retains full control of the Lara's movements. Another change is the more non-linear level design more in vein with the traditional entries of the series.

Torino 2006 - The Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games (USA)>Torino 2006 - The Official Video Game of the XX Olympic Winter Games>2006>ESRB - E (Everyone)>2K Games, Inc.>49Games>Sports/Olympic>3.3>1-4 Players>Torino 2006 is the official game of the XX Winter Olympic Games held in Turin, Italy, and the eight in the line of multi-event IOC licensed titles. The game includes 15 events scattered on 8 disciplines: Alpine Skiing (Downhill, Super G, Giant Slalom and Slalom), Ski Jump (Normal and Large hill), Speed Skating (500m, 1000m and 1500m), Women's Biathlon, Nordic Combined, Bobsled (Womens' 2 and Mens' 4), Luge and Cross Country. All venues were modelled after their real counterparts.****Gameplay, as expected, requires more reflexes than the button-bashing of their Summer counterparts. Alpine Skiing is a matter of skill and quick reflexes, as the player, other than set the direction, only has to choose when to crouch to gain speed (mostly in Downhill and Giant Slalom) and when to carve the snow for sharper turns (either to correct a bad trajectory or approach a tighter gate). These events are based on a simplified version of the engine that power Ski Alpin 2006, also by 49Games. Unlike most other games that feature alpine skiing, the penalty for missing gate depends on the difficulty level chosen: on easy, six misses are allowed, three in medium and none on hard, each carrying a time penalty that depending on how well the player did can just affect the total score or mean losing a medal.****Ski Jump (also a simplified version of another game, RTL Skispringen 2006) requires the player to keep the balance while descending the hill, jumping at the correct time, counter the effect of the wind in the athletes' balance for maximum distance and then land in perfect telemark fashion.****Cross Country and Biathlon are relaxed disciplines where all that counts is keeping the best trajectory possible while looking out for straight paths that can be used for short sprints and downhill slopes that can be done while crouching, which allows greater speeds and lower fatigue accumulated from sprints and more hasty climbs. Biathlon is pretty much the same as Cross Country, except it also includes two shooting sessions, with the steadiness of the aim affected by the fatigue levels.****Skating disciplines require a strong, well timed start, and then accurate button pressing as the skater makes each step. **Bobsled and Luge are similar with only two differences: The startup in Bobsled is done by following the on-screen cues and press up on the right time and other than setting the direction, it's also possible to make minimal path changes.

The player have to activate them manually by pressing the appropriate triggers (via buttons) to activate the traps. The 3 different button/triggers represent 3 different traps: Floor traps, Ceiling traps, and Wall traps. These are the only traps the player has direct access to.****Other traps or devices are also located in the many rooms. The player can ""link/connect"" them with other traps to create combos at the displeasure of the enemy. The more combo's, the more money the player acquires, of which means the more traps the player can purchase for future planning. ****Placing traps can be done at any point during this real-time setting, which is basically the uniqueness of your powers. This means you can move and place traps around, even when the enemy is chasing you. However, traps have to recharge: after it is placed and after it is sprung, so timing is also crucial here."

Only on the PlayStation 2, TM:B includes old favorites and a lot of new characters.  The game has a very dark and gothic theme to it, with the music to back it up.  Detailed graphics, day/night cycle, particle effects, and a constant 60 frames per second.  TM:B also boasts a multiplayer mode, with 1-4 multiplayers, over ten arenas (some specific to multiplayer), and a cooperative mode, so instead of fighting each other, you can work together.

In Manhunt, one of the players becomes the prey and the others, the hunters.

One of the changes is the inclusion of four lost levels of a new Twisted Metal game that was never finished (it was cancelled after six members of the production team died in a plane crash).  It features the characters from Twisted Metal: Black, but with new stories (unfortunately, no endings were done for them) and two extra characters, 12-Pak and Gold Tooth.  The levels are a massive suburban area, a giant stadium, a local carnival and a ship yard.****Another feature is the ability to walk around in an asylum as Sweet Tooth, a feature that was being worked on for the new Twisted Metal that was going to be used for character based foot missions.  In it you can roam the asylum and collect Sweet Tooth shaped heads that include facts about the history of the Twisted Metal series.****Includes documentaries of the history of Twisted Metal and live action videos of endings for the original Twisted Metal on the Playstation that looks like old, worn out videotape, some of which have completely different endings from the final versions, even making Sweet Tooth sound almost like Mick ""Mankind"" Foley of WWE/WWF fame."

You play Ty the Tasmanian Tiger and set out to defeat the evil Boss Cass.  Along the way you will rescue friends, collect opals and defeat bad guys with boomerangs and a nasty set of chompers.  There are lots of missions and side quests and gameplay appropriate for all ages.

The player takes the role of TY, a Tasmanian tiger, armed with sharp teeth and boomerangs a-plenty. On TY's quest to defeat the evil Boss Cass and his army of cold-blooded Frilled Lizards, he must assist the colorful residents of Burramudgee Town and the Southern Rivers, who include a tree frog, a lyre bird, a platypus family, some kangaroos and more koalas than you can shake a didgeridoo at.****While most of the game is standard platform fare, there are some diversions. Notably, there are a number of cart racing tracks which can be played with a friend. Additionally, there are missions that will place the player in giant robots, each with a different speciality (one is good at battle, one can put out fires, one is a submarine, etc.).****There are many comedic quirks, having the players throw electrified boomerangs at robotic dinosaurs in the Outback, then send them up in a helicopter to rescue sheep stranded by a flood, then have them clear a road following a traffic accident. And finally, to top it all off, the save/continue points are outhouses.

It's up to Ty to reunite his team members, as well as stop the Quinkan from unleashing the mysterious Quinking, an evil being of supreme power.****Night of the Quinkan is the third game in the Ty series.  As Ty, players can bite at foes, or use his boomerangs for consecutive ranged attacks.  Boomerangs can be customized in an assortment of ways: either by changing the chassis (each chassis has its own special abilities); or by equipping special Bunyip Stones to the boomerang's chassis.  Some stones can be combined with others, allowing players to customize their attacks to their liking.  Some stones are rewards for completing tasks; others, as well as boomerang chassis, can be purchased from the Rang Shop in exchange for Opals, the game's currency.****Ty 3 again rolls out the robotic mechs - choose from the Shadow or Extreme Bunyip (your standard mech), the Crabmersible (a submarine shaped like a crab, oddly enough), or the Gunyip (a speedy airplane with an assortment of bombs and guns).  Ty can even take part in cart races against other characters for powerups and even more opals.

There is exclusive Champions League footage to be unlocked and the in-game commentary is done by Guy Mowbray, Barry Venison and Gabby Logan.****The game allows the player to participate in friendlies, Champions League matches, leagues and cup tournaments. You can also edit players and create teams with custom players. Tactics can be modified to suit the team's style and qualities. The gameplay remains close to the previous title, with free-flowing ball physics and the stress on accurate passing. The new changes mostly revolve around set pieces (it is now possible to aim to a player). ****Graphically, it uses a new engine with features such as volumetric grass and real-time lighting.
UEFA Champions League 2004-2005 (Europe)>UEFA Champions League 2004-2005>2005>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Electronic Arts, Inc.>Electronic Arts>Sports/Soccer>3.4>1-8 Players>"After many years under Eidos/Silicon Dreams ownership and development, EA releases the official Champions League game for the 2004/2005 season. ****The last rehash of the engine debuted on FIFA 2003, it draws most of it's gameplay elements from the 2005 edition, but with some changes to gameplay such as a slightly more aggressive AI on attack (reducing the need to constantly push players forward using the Off The Ball controls, still present), new refereeing aspects such as some deliberate errors (as in occasional bad offside calls or throw-ins, not cheating the player through mistakes),  advantage rule and handballs and a new set piece system, which replaces the much criticized ""targeting"" and ""push and shove"" featured in 2005. This system is much less rigid and less formulaic, as a directional arrow and powerbars define how balls are crossed and there are four player movement setups, thus making each corner and indirect free kicks different. For direct free kicks, players have the option to take driven or curved shots or drop a pass to a nearby player to explore a gap in the defense. All options are available at all times, instead of being determined by the distance to goal. **Many of these changes were later adapted into the new FIFA 06 engine, and it was also chosen as the match engine for subsequent Bright Future's  FIFA Manager. ****The presentation takes notes from real television broadcasts, with goals, fouls and attempts on goal being recapped not only in the full-time highlight reel but also during game stoppages and PiP popups. As the game is presented in a faux letterboxed format, next to the scoreline some statistics occasionally popup, allowing to keep track of them for some missions. A very requested feature, the ability to see the energy bars of the closest players to the ball of both teams, was finally included, as well as icons for the special abilities (speed, shooting, dribbling or tackling) of the best players.****The Champions League, where the player leads one team to the Final in the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, in the quest to succeed FC Porto as European Champions, is one of the available modes, but not the most important. That honour goes to the ""The Season"" mode, where the player starts by creating his managing avatar, and then proceeds to a a series of 50 missions, with the first being a close last-week match against a Champions League spot rival, proceeding with a buyout of the club and increased expectations, and (hopefully) closing with the Champions League final.  This mode also allows players to unlock additional features such as balls, a stadium and special exhibition modes by fulfilling objectives set by the club president during the season, some of them crucial matches (which can result in a sacking if  failed), others simply a matter of balancing the squad. Other modes include the usual friendlies, ""home and away"" (a two-legged friendly), scenarios (where the player can create situations such as a defending a 1-0 nil for 45 minutes while two man down) and practice."

The deck represents a team of players, managers and other staff which are used to manage and develop a fantasy team from humble beginnings to the best team in the in the game. Cards may also be put up for trade with other players to help you acquire rare cards and earn game credits. Players can take their Ultimate Teams online and use additional game play cards to strategic advantage during the match.

This time it's basically FIFA 08 modified to let the player experience this summer's European Championship. ****Euro 2008 lets you control any European national football team in many different ways. For example you can decide to create your own character and play as good as possible on your position on the field in order to become good enough to captain your team. This is basically a slightly modified version of the ""be a pro""-mode from FIFA 08.****You can also try different challenges and tournament modes in order to unlock extras or just test your abilities. You can play through the full championship experience, including the qualifying stages, or you can skip ahead to the group stages. You can also play a very extensive challenge mode where you try to make you nation the best in European football by clearing different challenges against all the other European teams. ****As with FIFA 08 the PC and console versions are quite different. In fact, they are based on completely different game engines. While the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3-versions boasts state of the art graphics and a new and improved control system, the PC-version still basically looks and functions like the 2006-version."

The winner is the player with the most points and players each have two 'jokers' to remove a wrong answer • Play or Pass: This is also played over three eight question rounds. Players have three lives and lose a life with each incorrect answer, they also have one joker per round which they can use to pass a tough question on to an opponent. If a player answers their question correctly they can select which opponent is asked the next question. • Shoot Out: A quick on the button round where questions are not addressed in turn to each player • Quiz Trilogy: This consists of one round from each of the above quiz modes.

You can launch a giant bowling ball, a cannon or a karaoke set to terrify the people with your awful singing. To obtain new weapons you have to scan the DNA of humans walking the streets, each having their own set of abilities. When you scare humans enough, they drop coins. Getting enough coins completes a level and ultimately, the game.****Under the Skin brings you to different locations, including Raccoon City, the place where the Resident Evil games take place.

Like in the early  Romancing Saga games, and in  Saga Frontier, you assume the role of eight main characters (selectable at the beginning of the game). The story centers around Laura, a 30-year old widow and an ex-pirate, but you view the story and make it progress differently depending on which character you have chosen, and on the decisions you take throughout the game. Each character is represented by a different kind of flower.****""Unlimited SaGa"" feels and plays a lot like a classic board RPG. Everything - from disarming traps to hitting the enemy successfully in a battle - depends on the so-called REEL system. You have to stop a spinning slot machine at the right time, in order to perform an action successfully. It is similar to the classic dice system in pen-and-paper RPGs, and to the Judgment Ring system in  Shadow Hearts. You can explore the world in a non-linear fashion, visit many optional areas and fight monsters at your will. Some puzzles have multiple solutions and can be solved by using a character's special skill. For example, a character with a Swim skill can cross a river and reach the next area of the game."
Unreal Tournament (USA)>Unreal Tournament>2000>ESRB - M (Mature)>Infogrames, Inc.>Epic Games>Shooter>3.6>1-4 Players>Unreal Tournament is completely different to Unreal - it's now mainly based on multiplayer, like Quake 3. ****At the beginning, you have to play classic deathmatch rounds. After you have successfully won some of them, a new game mode becomes available, domination. In domination there are about 3 or 4 different areas scattered around the map to be controlled by your team. For a certain amount of seconds you control one area, a point is added to your score. The more areas you control, the faster your team's score rises. When you or the other team reaches a certain score, the game is over.

Wild Arms 3 (USA)>Wild Arms 3>2002>ESRB - T (Teen)>Sony Computer Entertainment Incorporated>SCEA>Role-Playing>3.6>1 Player>"In ancient times, a war was fought against demons on a world named Filgara. The planet bears the scars of this encounter as much of the world is barren and the ocean has turned to sand. For different reasons, four characters set out to become ""drifters"" and make their own path over the plains. Virginia Maxwell chose this trip on a steam train because she was bored by the monotonous life in a sleepy village and wanted to explore the world. Treasure-hunter Jet Enduro thinks the train will bring him to a place where a flower with magic powers can be found. Gallows Caradine is a shaman of his tribe and is the guardian of a sacred artifact. Clive Winslet is a cynical archaeologist and part-time bounty hunter. A fateful encounter aboard a train will bring these four together and mix them up in the doings of a mysterious organization of scientists. This Council of Seven once was formed to renew the life force of Filgara, but now seems to be harnessing it for their own means.****This third installment of the Wild Arms series continues the tradition of two previous games, adding a stronger emphasis on the (fantasy) Wild West atmosphere. Characters have the ability to attack using ARMS (projectile weapons), use special abilities, use items or cast Arcana (magic). From the beginning of the game, each of the four characters has an introductory chapter before becoming a party and traveling together.  The battles are random, with a FP gauge which fills while attacking and defending, and usage of Arms and magic which require FP, similar to the second game of the series. Later on, special vehicles feature their own type of battle system. Other similarities to previous Wild arms games include the search system (towns and dungeons are not indicated on the map until you discover them), the ability to cancel a random battle and special abilities used outside of battles to solve puzzles. An interesting innovation is a dialogue based on key words, similar to a system commonly used in adventure games, which allows a more flexible use of dialogue options."

The visuals are very fast and the soundtrack consists of mostly electronic tracks, a hallmark of the series.****The base game consists of twelve tracks, but these can be driven in both directions (designated by black or white in the title name).

As usual, new tracks and faster models need to be unlocked by winning races, but instead of a linear model these are now grouped as hexagon-clustered grids with different modes of play. When available, players can choose any of the sections to participate in a time trial, single race, head-to-head, eliminator games (returning from Wipeout 3) and Zone games (introduced in WipEout Fusion) where the vehicle constantly accelerates and transforms into faster models until all health is depleted. A certain amount of races need to be won to access a new grid, but using this system some difficult races can be avoided or ignored. In all races the vehicles are destroyed when all energy is depleted. Based on the performance a bronze, silver or gold medal is awarded and there are three difficulty settings.****Using the vehicle of a certain team regularly is awarded with a loyalty system.

The game is for the most part a simulation of real-life racing, with a strong career mode and a number of customization options. There are also elements to it that make it accessible to those who are looking to try something new, but overall, this is a game that is aimed directly at sprint car racing fans. As such, the developmental focus was clearly on the gameplay, seemingly at the expense of the audio and visual aspects of the game.

World Super Police (Europe)>World Super Police>2006>ESRB - E10+ (Everyone 10+)>Midas Interactive Entertainment>Suzak>Driving>2.8>1 Player>World Super Police is a single player police pursuit game.  Gameplay here is virtually identical to games like Outrun, a series of games that started life on the DOS and Amiga platforms in the mid eighties.  The story behind the game is that normal police cars cannot catch criminals in really fast cars so, in order to combat increasing car crime, the World Super Police (WSP) have been formed. There are two strands to this game, one based around the Blue Wing group (WSP Japan) and the other around Red Hawks (WSP USA). In each strand there is a story but the missions are basically the same, the player's car sits firmly in the centre of the screen at the bottom and the scenery rushes by. On the left of the screen is a vertical bar which gives a 'radar' view the road ahead  The object is to keep the car on the road, travel as fast as possible avoiding other traffic, and take-out the bad guy with whatever weapons the player equipped their car(s) with. This involves racing for a minute or so until the target(s) show up on the radar at which point the felonious fiend must be stopped before they reach the border. Some missions are solo and unarmed, while in others the player is accompanied by fellow WSP in super cars and they can switch between offensive and defensive formations.  The game's main menu also features a Training option which, unusually, is greyed out at the start of the game and can only be accessed once the player has completed one or more missions in either story.

Xenosaga Episode I - Der Wille zur Macht (USA)>Xenosaga Episode I - Der Wille zur Macht>2003>ESRB - T (Teen)>Namco Limited>Monolith Soft>Role-Playing>3.7>1 Player>"Year 20XX. Lake Turkana, Kenya.  A group of scientists discover a mysterious monolith called Zohar.****Year 4767 T.C. - Transcend Christ, or 7277 A.D., according to the old year-counting system. Zohar is no longer a mystery. All space ships are Zohar-powered. Humanity left the planet Earth (which is now called Lost Jerusalem) long ago, and founded a galactic empire on 30000 planets. However, a hostile alien race called ""Gnosis"" is hunting after Zohar. Giant bi-pedal robots called Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems (pronounced ""eggs"") do not seem to be enough to stop the Gnosis. The Vector Corporation decides to develop an android called KOS-MOS to be the ultimate weapon against the Gnosis. Shion Uzuki is the 22-year-old engineer leading this project.****Xenosaga is not part of the same universe as the Square game Xenogears, although it is based on the back-story of that game as written in Xenogears Perfect Works. The events of Xenosaga are roughly analogous to the very first events in the history of Xenogears, although as the series progressed events would diverge more and more from the timeline of Xenogears. ""Der Wille zur Macht"" is one of the central aspects of Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy, meaning ""The will to power"". ****The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated. Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the next few ally and enemy turns will be shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character's ""boost"" gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts. Each character has a unique tree of Ether spells they can learn by spending Ether points earned in battle, with lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS."

Another game aspect removed from the first game is money, as well as shops, weapons, and armor of any kind.
