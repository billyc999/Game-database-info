bel>Behind... Enemy Lines>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>Sega>Real3D>Shooter>4.3>1-2 Players>Behind Enemy Lines is a first person rail shooter where the player controls a machine gun mounted on a jeep driving through enemy territory. The game consists of four missions that all involve infiltrating and destroying various enemy facilities. The setting is modern and enemies include simple foot soldiers, light vehicles such as jeeps and humvees and heavy vehicles like tanks and helicopters. As in other rail shooters the player's control is limited to moving a crosshair and shooting while movement is automatic. The main weapon is a machine gun that can fire both bullets and missiles. There is no reloading and it's not possible to run out of ammo completely but if the ammo counter gets too low the firing rate will decrease. Therefore more ammo has to be collected by destroying ammo crates. Missiles too has to be collected by destroying crates. They can however only be used on certain heavy targets, such as helicopters and tanks and when aiming on these the missile will automatically lock on the target and the player only has to launch it by pressing the right button. Fuel can also be collected by hitting fuel drums. If the vehicle's fuel supply is depleted the player will get a score penalty.

fvipers>Fighting Vipers>1995>ESRB - T (Teen)>Sega>Sega AM2>Fighter>4>1-2 Players>Armstone City, year unknown. The Mayor decided to hold a fighting tournament with the grand finale being held on the top of the city tower, and the Vipers, young urban warriors decide to compete, each with their own goal on mind. All eight came from several backgrounds, like the hard-rocker Raxel, the orphan with a burning desire to meet his father Bahn, former gang leader Tokyo, queen of the catwalk Grace, the giant with an unknown past Sanman, construction worker and former marine trainee Jane, fashion designer to-be Candy and skater boy Picky, plus Mahler, someone with a score to settle with the Mayor. While based on the same Model-2 arcade board as Virtua Fighter 2, Fighting Vipers included several changes, such as a wall surrounding the battle area and equipping each fighter with a two-piece (chest and legs) armour that can only be broken with power hits. Once the armour is gone, the unfortunate fighter is more vulnerable to opponent hits, and damage can also be collected after hitting the wall or floor after a throw. Gameplay is also radically different from Virtua Fighter - noticeably faster, with combos done by fast button-mashing sequences sometimes on the same button, instead of the timed presses that require an additional push on the d-pad of the first title. Another new addition to gameplay is the Quick recovery, which allows a fighter that suffered a severe blow to quickly get on his feet, avoiding damage and allowing for a quick counter, but at the same time leaving him open for another blow if the opponent is fast enough. to react. Game modes include Arcade, Vs, Team Battle (best of 9) and Training. Game options allow the player to tweak the difficulty setting, number of rounds before a match winner is decided, size of life bars, if there's a time limit, if the order of opponents is random or predefined and between three game modes: Original (based on the arcade version), Arrange (gameplay tweaked for the Sega Saturn) and Hyper (allows Vipers to voluntarily drop their armour, allowing to perform special attacks at lightening fast speeds), Stage selection, and to change the disposition of the control pad to better suit the players' style.

After open-wheel, stock and rally cars, Sega took on the popular European Touring Car races (factory models modified for racing), featuring four real models (Alfa Romeo 155V6TI, Toyota Supra GT, AMG Mercedes C-Class and Opel Calibra V6) as well as some hidden cars. Some models feature four-wheel drive (easier to control on sharper turns) while other only have rear-wheel drive (forcing the player to calculate turns properly so the car doesn't skid). Because of this, gameplay is notoriously tighter and less forgiving than in any of the previous titles by Sega. Like with other Sega arcade ports, this home versions features both an ""Arcade"" and a ""PC""/""Saturn"" mode (the biggest difference being the time constraints and inability to use tweaked cars in arcade) with the usual Championship (three races in a row) and Time Attack modes, and a 2P split-screen race is also available. There are three tracks, plus one more as the final race (as usual with contemporary Sega arcade racers), and two viewpoints (behind and front bumper) are at the disposal of the player. As usual, there are additional modes, tracks and cars to be unlocked for those proficient in the game.  Another feature was the ""Global Ranking"" mode, where players of either version could e-mail Sega of Japan a password containing his times, and compare them to the World's finest players, as well as in special one-day only ""Global Net Events""."

vcop>Virtua Cop>1994>ESRB - T (Teen)>Sega>Sega AM2>Gun>3.7>1-2 Players>Cast as one of two brave cops, players of Virtua Cop are charged with bringing down an evil crime syndicate that is running riot in some unspecified town. Dropped into a series of locations, one or two players must arm up and shoot their way through three death filled levels, in an attempt to restore peace and order. Played from a first person perspective view, players can use keys or joypad, to aim and fire at the multitude of sharp shooters who come gunning for them. Starting the game armed with just a trusty old six-shooter, players can pick up more powerful, state-of-the-art weapons -- such as machine guns and shotguns -- as they progress. As these are hidden away in crates and the like, finding these weapons is an important part of the game and they can give players extra firepower when they most need it. In particular, such weapons can be extremely useful when trying to take on the customary end-of-level bosses. Made of stern stuff, you'll need all the help you can get in dispatching them off to hell.  
vcop2>Virtua Cop 2>1995>ESRB - T (Teen)>Sega>Sega AM2>Gun>4.3>1-2 Players>Virtua Cop 2 follows the same gameplay pattern of its predecessor. You are a police officer sent after criminals, from subways and a bank to aboard helicopters. The game moves you automatically, although you can find hiding places to shoot from a safe angle. Your main task is to aim and fire your weapon so as to take out the bad guys for points. Avoid the innocents, as shooting them costs you points. The enemies have tougher firepower than in the original.
vf2>Virtua Fighter 2.1>1995>ESRB - T (Teen)>Sega>Sega AM2>Fighter>4.1>1-2 Players>Virtua Fighter 2.1 is a revised version featuring re-tweaked gameplay, slightly enhanced graphics and the ability to play as Dural: One year after after the first tournament Akira, Wolf, Pai, Jeffry, Kage, Jacky, Sarah and defending champion Lau are invited to the World Fighting Tournament, and are joined by the master of drunken Kung-Fu Shun-di, who wants to prove he's more than an old geezer and Lion Rafale, who's fighting for his freedom. Each fighter has his own style, from the lightning fast attacks of Pai to the powerful slams of Jeffry.  Home port of Sega's popular Model 2A arcade vs. fighter released in 1995. Game modes include classic arcade mode, 2P vs mode, Expert mode (where the computer character progressively learns and counters players' technique), Ranking Mode (similar to Arcade, but at the end, a fighting style analysis is shown based on number of specials and time to knock down an opponent), Team Battle Mode (two teams composed of five fighters go against each other, the first to beat five characters being the winner) and Watch mode (allows choosing two fighters and then see them fighting). Both VF2 and VF2.1 (a tweaked version available only in Japan) modes are included. Gameplay keeps the same style from the first game, adding more moves to each fighters' roll. Using a three-key layout (block, kick and punch, being possible to assign button combinations to the extra keys) the player is able to control their fighter, aiming to knock or push the opponent outside the rink inside the time limit. Combo moves range from the quickest, which require the player to push up to five buttons quickly, to strong moves that require more button presses along d-pad nudges to be successful. As with the previous game, fighting is realistic (except the physics-defying leaps), and each fighter has nothing but their body to harm the opponent.  While in comparison with the arcade version some parts took a hit on graphical quality (such as the texture details and backgrounds), the game uses the Saturn High-Resolution mode and flowing 60-fps to bring the arcade experience home.
