""A dog with a human's face was rummaging in the compost pile."" ""Somebody saw an old woman selling humans' feet."" These pointless rumors have exploded, and driven the children into fear. Unlike the youkai whose natural purpose is to attack humans, these rumors are both unsettling and impossible to discern the truth underneath. Since there were no real victims, the adults have come to think of them as merely children's silly talks. Of course, the girls are not afraid. They know these to be the outside world's ""urban legends"" (made-up stories). Urban legends have an interesting property. As the circulating rumors change, the anomalies will change correspondingly. Reimu and company have assumed the rumors that fit them, and treat the anomalies as their playthings. As long as one can control the rumors without being afraid, the manifested anomalies can be rendered harmless. More than that, they can be turned into powers of one's own. The girls thought of controlling the urban legends by themselves as a necessary measure for keeping people from harm. This had indeed been true. Until one night... "

This grudge came from the fact that Chang'e's husband shot down nine out of ten suns, according to legend, one of them landing on her son and killing him. Since then, she purified her grudge to the point where she's nothing more than pure resentment. Junko calmed her rage by repeatedly attacking the Lunar Capital, but none of her attacks have been successful. Then she met with Hecatia Lapislazuli, a goddess of Hell who sympathized with her because she also had a grudge against Chang'e. Hecatia allowed Junko to use fairies such as Clownpiece in her plan to invade the Lunar Capital and leave Chang'e vulnerable. Junko purified the Hell fairies into pure life force so they can wreak havoc on the Lunar Capital while also being immune to the lunarians' purifying weaponry. Because of this, the goddess Sagume Kishin and the moon sages froze the Lunar Capital and asked Doremy Sweet to make a replica Lunar Capital in the Dream World. Since the Lunarians couldn't stay in the Dream World forever, Sagume developed the ""Lunar Capital Transfer Plan"", which involved purifiying Gensokyo so it could be inhabited by the lunarians. But youkai were also living in Gensokyo, so Sagume created an Occult Orb that could spread a particular urban legend called the ""Apollo Project Coverup Theory"", so the Lunar Capital could materialize in Gensokyo, prompting the events of Urban Legend in Limbo, which would later turn into the events of Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom.

She charges through the gateway into another worlds, intent on locating and punishing the one responsible for the act. Although she isn't capable of harming her enemies directly, she wields an incredible weapon: the Yin-Yang Orb. With it Reimu will be able to cut a bloody swath through all who stand before her... assuming that she can manage to control it! The story itself is non-existent throughout the game itself. After Stage 5, the player can choose either to follow the gate into Hell or the gate into Makai, each with their own enemies. It is implied that Reimu defeats whoever originally destroyed her shrine. The endings for the game are equally difficult to understand, as depending on which route the player takes, the Yin-Yang Orb will transform into a tiny wish-granting fairy or a joyful, but strange creature that starts smashing parts of the shrine. The bad ending for the game involves Reimu leaving and then a giant explosion is seen, something also difficult to understand.

The names and titles of the boss characters in this game appear only in the endings.

She spread herself out in the form of a mist all throughout Gensokyo, and ""gathered"" the hearts of both humans and youkai to cause them to have a feast every few days.

Samidare>Samidare>2002>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Amusement Makers>RebRank>Shooter>3.8>1 Player>"In 2785, full-scale war breaks out on Earth over the various nations' rights to extraplanetary resources. This war ravages the Earth's environment, forcing humanity to flee underground. It also sees the creation of the M.R.S. (Machine manufacture Research and development System), an automated manufacturing and battle system designed to allow wars to take place without actual human participation. Unfortunately, within five years of humanity's flight underground, M.R.S. has completely taken control of the Earth's surface, and the first exploratory group from humanity's underground Shelters is annihilated. Not long after this first exploratory mission, the M.R.S. system discovers the Absolute Dimensional Barrier technology and eventually refines it into the Dimensional Absolute Barrier Shield; it uses its SMD series of warplanes to test and perfect the system. Unfortunately, the prototype unit, SMD-00x, disappears after activating the barrier for the first time, and though M.R.S. is eventually able to establish contact with the dimensional void into which SMD-00x disappeared, it's never actually able to find the ship again. Nevertheless, the system continues developing the SMD series, creating smaller, more capable craft such as the SMD-24-0x ""Samidare"", which is piloted by a humanoid control unit, C-22, and the final unit, SMD-31-FX ""Gesshoku"", whose control unit, C-23, possesses an advanced, self-aware AI. Meanwhile, humanity is busy urbanizing its Shelters, developing bipedal robots (armed lightweight walking vehicles, or ALWVs), and preparing to take the fight to M.R.S. Sixty years after the cataclysm that drove humanity underground, it finally emerges to retake the surface. By this time, M.R.S. has developed significant internal defects, and the battle is relatively short. Within two decades, almost all M.R.S.-created automata on the surface have been destroyed. Samidare's main story mode follows the major missions of SMD-24-0x: its testing against the biomechanical construct Sylphid, its encounter with Anareta, the defense system of long-ruined space outpost Tetra-Biblos, and its encounter with the SMD series prototype, SMD-00x. The extra mode follows a flight of the SMD-31-FX several decades later, after SMD-24-0x makes it back to Earth (if you get the good ending). "
