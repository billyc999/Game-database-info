The object of the game is to be the first to collect a card for each of the four colors on the game board. During each turn the computer will display seemingly random dots, then a pencil starts connecting the dots to form a picture. The first player to correctly identify the picture will earn a card for the color of the picture being drawn. As the picture draws, a dice on the screen will count down from 6 to 1. Whatever value is showing when a player successfully identifies the picture is the number of spaces that players game piece will move on the game board for the next turn. The color of the space the game piece lands on will dictate the category for the next picture to be drawn. ****Each game will choose four categories from the various options, which include: tools, man made, clothing, food, math, office, travel, music, things, natural, leisure, and many others. After you've mastered the easier skill levels, the difficulty can be increased which will present more complicated pictures, remove some of the dots from the picture, or eliminate the dots entirely.

Archon (USA)>Archon>1989>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Activision, Inc.>Free Fall Associates>Board Games>2.1>1-2 Players>Archon: The Light and the Dark is a strategic board game with some similarities to chess. Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares or by removing all opposing pieces from the board. ****However, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat (just like in Star Control, also by Paul Reiche III). If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.****Unlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard & the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc.****The different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles.****Archon can be played with either one or two players.**The NES version, which was released a few years after the other versions, has improved graphics for the real-time combat part. Each type of square has it's own colored background and the unit sprites are larger.
Arkanoid (USA)>Arkanoid>1987>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Taito Corporation>Taito Corporation>Breakout>3.1>1-2 Players>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.****The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.****By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.

The game is broken down into many stages, the goal of each being to simply find a way into the next stage.  Playing out in puzzle fashion, you will shoot all the enemies on screen, earn the hidden key, and find the correct exit.  Defeated enemies will randomly drop bonuses that can be collected; these items include health restore, increased armor, and weapon improvements.****Beating the entire game requires successful progression through 125 stages.

The chipmunks' offensive ability is to pick up any of the copious blocks that litter the landscape and toss it in any of 5 directions (sideways, up, and diagonal-up). Along the way, there are scattered RR blocks for the heroes to collect. The other members of the Rescue Rangers -- Monty, Gadget, and Zipper -- are on hand to lend help out at key junctures.

Cobra Triangle (USA)>Cobra Triangle>1989>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo of America Inc.>Rare, Ltd.>Action>3.2>1 Player>Cobra Triangle is a single-player boat-racing game that lets you do more than race. It borrows the power-up system from the shoot 'em up genre but keeps the emphasis more on maneuvering than shooting. Since you have a health meter with a dozen bars in it, it's not that important to dodge bullets unless your health is really low, but you should try not to run into too many walls. In order to get very far you need to make use of your power-ups which are TURBO for better acceleration; FIRE for increased firepower; SPEED for increased top-speed; MISSILE for firing missiles as well as bullets; and FORCE which makes you fire tons of missiles and also makes you invincible for a limited time. You get roughly one minute to complete each level. Speaking of which, there are 7 types of levels each with a different objective:****(1) Race to the Finish - Shoot other boats along the way to the finish line and avoid enemies like turrets and sharks. Some boats tow power-up pods behind them that you can collect after you shoot them. It doesn't matter when you finish, and you aren't told if you get 1st or 2nd or 3rd place... it seems that the other boats are only there to get in your way. Watch for the fork in the river; choosing alternate paths takes you to the same levels of the game but in a different order.****(2) Collect the Pods - Simply race in a straight path while running over ramps to collect pods and 1UP's in the air. You go on to the next level when time runs out.****(3) Dispose of Mines - There is a small square in the water with mines in it. You actually have to collect the mines and tow them to another square to make them explode. Of course, there is an invincible enemy boat that tries to steal them back from you and some guys that shoot at you. It takes awhile since you can only tow them one at a time.****(4) Fry the Monster - The 'boss' levels. You fight a sea-serpent, a crab, a shark, etc. He has his own health display right above yours, but it tends to deplete slower.**(BONUS) Shoot the Targets - after every boss level you go to an auto-scrolling level where you are rewarded with a 1UP prize if you manage to shoot all the targets along the shore without missing any.****(5) Guard the People - There's a large square filled with 8 helpless swimmers, and for some reason they're all about to be kidnapped. Other boats race into the square and tow them away unless you destroy their ships before they get away. You can tow the people back into the square-if you have time-while avoiding the spaceships that fire stunning missiles at you. If you have at least one swimmer left when the timer runs out then you pass.****(6) Reach the Finish - Race in a straight course with plenty of obstacles but no other boats. You drive upstream while the current drags a horde of logs and whirlpools in your direction to stop you. Occasionally some planes fly by and shoot at you. If you happen to die in this or any other level, you simply reappear on the spot as long as you have an extra life. A continue puts you back at the beginning of the level you were on.****(7) Jump the Waterfall - A level that consists of a series of moving ramps you must use to jump over huge pits. Moving currents, whirlpools, and the violation of several laws of physics makes this more difficult than it sounds.****The entire game consists of repeating these types of levels for a grand total of 25 stages. The later stages are much more difficult than the first. They're filled with additional obstacles like icebergs, more mines, more enemies, and longer courses. There are even speed-ramps that let you take small short-cuts in later racing levels.

Ltd.>Baseball/Sports>4>1-2 Players>In the 24th century, the game of Baseball is very different. Tired of paying huge players salaries, the team owners got together one weekend and came up with a bold new idea, Robots. Indeed they renamed their league the Cyber League and stocked it with four robot types; Cyborg, Tank, Floater or Motorcycle, to play. On an orbital stadium in space, these robots all play a slightly different variation of the baseball rules. Hitting the ball and catching pop-flys and making home runs are all the same, but when the call of a play is in dispute, there are no base referees; the robots engage in a one-on-one battle using any weaponry they're carrying. Of course to make things interesting, weaponry (and other robot parts and equipment) can only be purchased with team funds during a tournament game, and team funds can only be obtained by wins. Thus the series closer is always sure to be a sold out game.

There are 4 cars in each race, 1 or 2 player options, and 9 tracks to race on, with the Tradewest Speed Bowl the ultimate target, and is much longer but with double points (it's essentially a substitute for the licensed-elsewhere Indianapolis 500, which did pay double the usual level of IndyCar championship points for many years).****The player has limited fuel, and will run slowly if supplies run out, and the car can be damaged, although both are repairable in the pits. They get a turbo to use sparingly, which can also be recharged in the pits if they have bought more. After each race the player will get money (slightly more for a higher finish), which can be spent on upgrades such as improved power, brakes or more turbos.

The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied.  This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.****From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you loose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.****The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.

A party is formed by selecting up to five officers from a huge pool, many of whom would only join you after be bribed or defeated in combat.  Officers in turn each had a certain amount of soldiers, which essentially acted as hit points (i.e. Si Ma Ye leads 40000 men, and when he is hit by Zhang Bao, he loses 5000 men, so his manpower is now at 35000).  One of the first games on the NES to attempt to simulate large scale combat between different forces, although obviously in a very limited way.

The main terrorist, Hans, is after the money locked away in a safe on the 30th floor. His hacker, Theo, is slowly breaking the locks into the vault. It's up to McClain to stop them. Die Hard for the Nintendo Entertainment System is a lot different to its other counterparts. The game is played from a top-down perspective, rather than the 1st-/3rd-person perspective.****There are 40 terrorists scattered throughout the building, and the task is to clear each floor of terrorists. The stairwell, air duct or the express elevator is used to travel only to Floors 31-35. These are freely accessible at any time, doing away with linearity, and more floors are unlocked in ""Advanced"" mode). At the start of the game, John can only use his fists to deal with foes, but after bringing down some terrorists, several weapons become available, including the pistol, machine gun, C-4 explosives, rocket launcher, and flash bangs, using their weapons against them. When hit by these terrorists, John loses some life, but it can be restored by collecting soda cans and med-kits. The game ends when all life is lost. ****One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. Also notable is the ""foot meter"". It starts out full, but will eventually decrease if John steps on shattered glass or runs around at a faster speed. If the meter is empty, he will walk much slower than with a full meter. This may have been added in tune with the film, where the main character John McClain's feet end up in pretty bad shape near the end. Parts of the environments are destructible, most notably vending machines (receive free soda), glass walls and windows. Not all parts of the environment are shown on the screen all the time - a fog of war appears to shroud nearby areas in darkness.****The missions are time limited. There about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened (shown in the status screen), but more time can be gained by destroying the main computer on the fourth level. Once all the locks have been opened, there are only a few minutes to escape. Once this time expires, the game ends.****Like its counterparts, the game features cinematic sequences, which change the story depending on which actions are taken."

If enough cracks become connected that section of the island will fall into the ocean, hopefully taking an enemy (and not Dig Dug!) with it. When all of the Pookas and Fygars have been destroyed, the game moves on to the next, more difficult level.

Dirty Harry can punch and kick the copious thugs that assault him using their own fists, guns, baseball bats, nets, and dynamite. The hero can also pull is .44 and aim it in 5 directions in order to pick off enemies, but the ammo is limited.

There are some adventure elements as well, such as being able to walk through alleys to other streets and going through doors to enter building. Entering buildings provides even greater challenges, like snakes and laser flooring. Dirty Harry even takes the fight down to the sewer."

Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.**4. Crushing them with an elevator.****Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see.

When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. ****Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.****Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents.

Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator."
Eliminator Boat Duel (USA)>Eliminator Boat Duel>1991>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Electro Brain Corp.>Sculptured Software, Inc.>Water>3>1-2 Players>Eliminator Boat Duel is a ruthless one on one boat racing game that can either be played against the computer or a human opponent. The races take place in such settings as open water, the bayou, and even industrial water districts. Each boat race consists of several sections. First, there is the starting line -- where you can expect a $2000 fine for a false start -- which begins with a brief side-scrolling race with split-screen background scrolling, a common characteristic of later NES titles. The primary sections of the races are a mixture of top-down racing and 3rd-person racing from a perspective behind the boats. The top-down sections are the most involved with numerous threats to avoid such as alligators, sharks, and whirlpools that will turn you the wrong way. There are also ramps to jump off of, people in need of rescue, nitro speed boost powerups, and raw cash bonuses to collect. The 3rd person segments have less detail and distraction but move much quicker as the 2 players vie to stay within the flags, collect speed boosts, and hit the occasional ramp. Speed boosts are collected along the way and can be used at the player's discretion to gain a much-needed edge at any point during the race.****A race finishes back in the side-scrolling view. If the boats come through too close together, the bikini models on the sidelines act confused and request a slo-mo replay, which the game subsequently provides. Prize money is then awarded with which the players may use to repair and upgrade their boats with faster engines, tougher hulls, and better steering.

Attack zombies, dwarves, giant snakes, wyverns, evil gnomes, or one-eyed one-footed things with a large collection of swords and daggers or zap them with a magic spell. ****As areas are completed by defeating enemies, your character rises up in “levels” and achieves a new “rank” which is tied directly to the restore password (called a “mantra” in the game).

And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil Garland, and then the real journey begins...****Final Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single character. Before the game starts, the player chooses four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. Which four classes the player chooses for his characters is entirely up to him. He also gives the characters names. ****In the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests, and fights baddies when they are encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system; the ATB (active-time battle) system from the later installments is not used. In battle, the player gives each character in order a command (attack a particular enemy, cast a spell, use an item, or try to run.) Then the characters and the enemies act in a random order. Attacked enemies and party members lose hit points, dying when they reach zero HP. When all the enemies are defeated, living party members receive experience, eventually gaining a level and improving their stats when enough experience is accumulated. Slain party members can be revived in towns for a price. ****Spells are bought in cities in special shops. The spells are divided into two categories - white magic and black magic. White Mages can only use white magic, Black Mages can only use black magic, and Red Mages can use both.

Ice is created diagonally below Dana in the direction that he is facing, if there is already an ice block there, it will be destroyed. However, ice blocks cannot be created on a spot that is already occupied by a flame, so that the player will often have to find a way to create ice blocks next to or above a flame so that they can be pushed or dropped onto it. If an ice block is created next to another object or wall it will stick to it, meaning it can't be moved and won't fall down. It is therefor also possible to create ice bridges to get over chasms. When a loose ice block is pushed, it slides above the ground until it hits another object. Rocks can also be used to extinguish flames, but they are indestructible and only move one space when pushed (unless they are on an icy surface).****Some levels contain pipes through which Dana can go, burning jars that melt ice or moving monsters instead of flames.

There are also 2 completely different control schemes that a player can adopt for cruising around the course. The first scheme rotates and drives the ship in the direction that the control pad is being pressed.

If three human players are engaged, then Player 1 and 2 share the first controller, with the second controller going to Player 3.****For the first two rounds, six categories with five questions each are randomly selected by the computer to populate the game board. The contestant who answered the last question correctly gets to pick the category and a dollar value, with harder questions being worth more money. Players have ten seconds from the time a question appears to ""ring in"" with the appropriate controller button and answer. ****Answers are built by using the controller to navigate around a grid of letters and ""type"" out the correct answer. Spaces and punctuation are ignored, but spelling and grammar generally must match the expected answer exactly. The contestant has 30 seconds to provide the answer before ""time is up"" and the other players have the opportunity to ring in.****Final Jeopardy consists of one category, which players bet their current winnings on being able to answer. A single question from that category is asked after the hidden bets have been placed. Again, each player has 30 seconds to provide their answer while the other players are instructed to look away. At the end, scores are tallied and the winner declared.****Categories in this edition draw from general knowledge and do not follow a specific theme (like the sports or Star Wars editions). Each category will always consist of the same five questions, and the game draws on a limited number of categories. Repeats will appear after a handful of sessions played.

Legend of Zelda, The (USA)>Legend of Zelda, The>1992>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo of America Inc.>Nintendo Co., Ltd.>Adventure>4>1 Player>"In one of the darkest times in the Kingdom of Hyrule, a young, pointy-eared boy named Link takes on an epic quest to restore the fragmented Triforce of Wisdom and save the Princess Zelda from the clutches of the evil, power-hungry Ganon.****The Legend of Zelda for the NES marks the first action-adventure title of the popular Nintendo series. Players must make their way through the various forests, graveyards, plains, and deserts of the Overworld to find the secret entrances of the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together the broken Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, Link will be able to gain entry to Death Mountain, home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda.****The game is drawn in a top-down perspective. Link begins his quest in the Overworld, which features forests, mountains and lakes and is divided into several screens. Link can explore the Overworld freely, though when he enters a screen, he will encounter several enemies. He can attack them with his sword. If link is at full health, he can toss his sword to attack enemies from afar, but when he is hurt, even slightly, he can only fight in melee range. ****Link's health is represented by hearts; initially he can have a maximum of three hearts, but as he progresses in the game, he will find heart containers that increase his maximum health. The enemies are varied - some attack from up close, some shoot projectiles. When killed, they often leave behind an item - a heart to restore energy, rupees that function as money (and can be used to buy stuff in various shops in the Overworld), or bombs which can be picked up and set down to attack enemies or destroy some walls. When enemies are killed, they stay dead and will not re-appear once the screen is entered again. ****There are other items to find in the game; some function as weapons, while others are used to solve puzzles. ****To find the Triforce pieces, Link must explore dungeons. Once he finds an entrance to the dungeon and goes in, he must explore the rooms, fight enemies and collect keys until he finds the boss monster he must defeat. He will then be able to pick up a Triforce piece. Once he does so, however, all the monsters in the Overworld come back to life. ****If Link dies on his quest, he can continue it; he will go back to his start position in the Overworld, but with the items he managed to collect so far. When Link finishes his quest, the pl;ayer can choose to play the ""2nd quest"", which is essentially a harder version of the game. ****The Legend of Zelda is known for several factors that were revolutionary at the time: A full world that could be freely explored, power-ups that would permanently enhance your character's abilities, and a battery back-up save feature that allowed players to retain their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced out frequent action sequences with discovery, secrets, and exploration."

Emperor Hans sends his troops to deal with this threat, but they are no match for the ultimate evil one. As an alternative, the emperor summons the bearers of 4 Magical Bells. These 4 adventurers must make their way to the castle and work as a team if they are to destroy Ta-Keed.****The first part of Little Samson has each of the 4 characters journeying from his or her home land to the emperor's palace. This gives the player an opportunity to explore that character's unique abilities which will be essential throughout the game.****1. Samson is a human who is reasonably fast and also possesses magnificent rock climbing prowess. He is able to scale walls and hang across ceilings, and also grab onto walls and ceilings while jumping. His offensive option is the ability to shoot bells straight ahead.****2. Kikira is the Dragon Lord. Since she has claws, she does not slip on ice. When she jumps, she can also fly for short bursts. She breathes fire in 2 intensities, depending on how long the player holds down the fire button. Her fireballs spread in arc patterns.****3. Gamm is the Rock Lord. Since he is a living rock he is very strong. So strong in fact that spikes do not hurt him, which is very valuable in a number of situations. He is also very slow and has only a short leap. He has a powerful punch.****4. K.O. is the Mouse Lord. He is tiny which allows him to enter areas that other team members can not. He is also extremely fast and the highest jumper of the team. However, he is the weakest member so he can not sustain very much damage. He has the same wall and ceiling traversal abilities as Samson. Offensively, he can drop time-delay bombs.****When all 4 characters reach the emperor's palace, they all jump into Samson's bell. Actually, Gamm and K.O. quietly jump into Samson's bell; Kikira initially refuses. After a brief fight (with the player controlling Samson), Kikira joins the effort.

This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.****The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life.

The game features many points of view during gameplay. Most of the time, the game is played from a top-down perspective, as you travel through the country and walk through towns. At other times, the game switches to a side scrolling view when you are in a boss stage. On occasion, the view switches to a first person perspective and plays similar to a first person shooter.****Each bad guy you kill is worth money. You can use money to buy more bullets, dynamite, rifles or a patch up from a doctor. For example, you start with a short barreled gun which you can upgrade to either a medium or long barreled gun.

Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.****Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.****Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. ****Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.****The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.

Mega Man has the ability to jump and fire his weapon. He must travel to the levels of the six robot masters and defeat them in combat. By doing so, Mega Man is able to acquire their power for his own. These powers can then be used interchangeably with his main weapon and target the weaknesses of specific enemy bosses. Additionally, some hidden areas of the levels can only be accessed by using certain captured robot weapons. A special  Magnet Beam ability can also be found which can be used to create steps. ****Travelling throughout these levels, Mega Man is confronted by an army of lesser robot creations. Destroying these usually yields energy capsules (for refilling Mega Man's Energy), weapon capsules (for refilling Mega Man's special robot weapons), and extra lives shaped like Mega Man's head.

Come in please! ....****This is a traditional action-platformer: you jump from brick to brick while avoiding pits and shooting robots. It's quite similar, in all respects, to other Mega Man games; however, this is the first time that you get a sidekick. It's also the first time you're allowed to slide instead of merely walking. Also, there is a mysterious character called Protoman who may or may not be your friend.****Rush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when you need it. He starts out with the 'Rush Coil' ability to launch you to the top of the screen like a springboard; later he acquires the 'Rush Jet' ability to turn into a guided, floating platform to carry you wherever you need to go; and he also gets the 'Rush Marine' ability which is a submarine that works just like the jet except underwater and with the added ability to hop around out of the water(you can actually jump while on the jet but the jet continues to hover beneath you whereas you stay inside the submarine). All of these abilities function just like boss weapons.****How do those work, you ask? When you defeat the boss at the end of a level you gain his power - or at least a similar power. You may pause the game at any time and switch to any single power you have. It supplants your regular Arm Cannon with a limited - but superior - ability. The weapon ammo is displayed next to your energy meter. There are 8 of these, corresponding to the 8 main levels, even though there are 21 levels in the entire game. The bosses are as follows: Snake Man, Gemini Man, Needle Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, Top Man, Magnet Man, &amp; Hard Man.****Enemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your health. You'll definitely want some of these for Dr. Wily's fortress, if not for the levels before it, since you start the game with only 3 lives. There are even Surprise Boxes lying around for you to find. And, of course, you do get infinite continues and a password feature to resume play at the beginning of any level.

Only instead of a naked girl there is a mermaid who is wearing a bra. This mermaid lies on the bottom of the play field and sends colored bubbles into the air. What you must do is arrange the bubbles in such a way that they build a row of 4 or more of the same color. The game uses the same graphics (except the mermaid) and gameplay mechanics as the original, adding three difficulty settings, the possibility to begin from any stage, and a background story: the evil underwater emperor O-Dinten has sealed all the games (yes, that's right!) into bubbles, and you must complete the game to unlock them and to bring entertainment back to the sea people.

While the star of the game is Michael Andretti, who pops in before each race to offer useful advice about the current track, the game also has appearances by many other F-1 racing stars.

In order to reach your goal (and find out which of Mickey's friends is in trouble), you'll need to jump and climb your way through various levels which take place in different locations (including a fun house, a treacherous sea side, a pirate ship, and a castle). Each screen has numerous obstacles and enemies which will drain your energy if you come in contact; lose all of your energy, and a life is lost and the game ends when you have no lives left. You control Mickey Mouse and Minnie follows along. You'll need to make sure Minnie stays safe as you make your way through the levels (for example, if you mistime a jump and Mickey lands safely but Minnie doesn't a life will be lost). In addition to avoiding obstacles, there is also some occasional puzzle solving (such as locating a key to open locked doors, or finding your way out of the woods).

Sheriff Donald Duck needs to reclaim the molds and requests help from Mickey Mouse. Playing as Mickey you are tasked with collecting at least one of a specific number mold per level you are playing. There are five different locales which are Number City, Number Factory, Space Center, Number Museum, and Pete's Hideout.

The game contains three difficulty levels with only the super advanced mode allowing you to take damage from enemies.
Mickey's Safari in Letterland (USA)>Mickey's Safari in Letterland>1993>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Hi-Tech Expressions, Inc.>Beam Software Pty., Ltd.>Miscellaneous>3.3>1 Player>Mickey's Safari In Letterland chronicles Mickey Mouse's globetrotting adventures (on a slightly modified globe) to capture letters for educational purposes. Goofy assists with chauffeur and data processing duties. Mickey can venture into any of the following 6 territories: Yukon, Swamp, Forest, Jungle, Pyramid, and Caribbean. In each area, his mission is to collect three diamonds that contain letters. Doing so will spell a word. Then, Mickey ventures to the end of the level and collects a large slab. If Mickey collects the three diamonds in the stage to spell a 3-letter word, Mickey spells the word with digitized audio samples and says the word, complete with an illustration. Then, the slab that Mickey collected at the end of the stage is fed by Goofy through a large machine that spits out a letter. It is up to the player to identify which letter this is.****This game is oriented towards very young children. As such, it is essentially impossible to fail. There are many enemies in the game but none actually inflict harm. Snakes, porcupines, hippos, alligators, and even baby seals-- Mickey just bounces off each. Mickey can also swim handily and sustain long falls.****Further, the game allows the player to point at letters on a board and have Mickey say them using the cartridge's library of digitized mouse voice samples.
Micro Machines (USA) (Unl)>Micro Machines>1991>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Camerica>Codemasters Software Company Limited, The>Driving>3.6>1-2 Players>If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.****These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.****Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.****The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

You view the game slightly behind your plane, which must shoot out enemy planes, tanks and installations while avoiding their fire. You are armed with different kinds of weapons including downward bombs, air-to-air missiles and a nuclear bomb. More of each of these can be picked up by collecting the parachutes which are dropped into your path. There are mountain ranges, deserts and arctic scenes to clear along the way, with big boss planes to face.

Your task is to find the real king and ultimately to stop the alien invasion into Varn.****This is the first game in the  Might and Magic series, and one of the prototypes of role-playing games in general. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. The player creates a party of six adventurers, with traditional classes to choose from (fighter, cleric, etc.). The player also specifies the gender and the age of the characters - they grow old and will eventually die of natural causes. As in most RPGs, the gameplay revolves around exploring the game world, performing quests, and leveling up to be able to proceed to the story-advancing challenges. The turn-based battles typically take place against six monsters, but enemy reinforcements can appear once their comrades have been slain.

Now it's personal! Choosing one of the three fighters, the player embarks on a beat-em-up quest through the streets of Metro City.****The game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up and a one-player only game (unlike other Final Fight ports). Also exclusive to this particular Final Fight game is the experience system which allows gaining levels to learn additional moves, similar to the first Double Dragon game. The characters have all been squished down to super-deformed 8-bit likenesses.  Graphically this looks similar to River City Ransom. Each character has a button for attack and a button for jumping. Pressing the two together unleashes a character-specific super-move. Various grabbing moves and throws can also be done by moving the player near an enemy.

The goal is to destroy the multi-segmented millipede as it traverses its way through the mushroom forest towards the bottom of the screen.

NARC (USA)>NARC>1990>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.>Williams Electronic Games, Inc.>Shooter>3.4>1-2 Players>"Narc is a 1-2 player game, where your mission is to infiltrate the Mr. Big Corporation, the scourge of the underworld. To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit.  Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the ""E"" indicates the exit.****Your mission ain't going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies including the canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. Furthermore, they will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine.****More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.  Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. According to the game, this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?"

Gameplay is from two point of views, starting with an overhead view allowing you to set up the shot and choose a club, then switching to a 3-D point of view. Hitting the ball uses the common power meter where tapping the button starts the meter, tap the button a second time to select the amount of power in the shot, then tap the button a third time to select the amount of slice or hook.

While Nintendo did not get the NFL license for this one, it did secure the license of the NFL Player's Association, so the 8 teams to choose from (all named after the appropriate NFL cities) are all stocked up with real pro players from the 1989 season.  You can even substitute second-stringers for the ""skill"" positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired.****Play perspective is very unusual: top-down slightly modified with a three-quarters tilt behind the offense, and the scrolling is diagonal, from the bottom left to upper right of the screen.  Each team has 12 passing and 12 running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run.  The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from.  The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.****Games are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters.  There are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout ""First Down!"" (in audio) whenever a team moves the chains.  Team stats are displayed on a summary screen after every quarter of play.  Highest scoring team wins, which in playoffs mode means moving on to the next round--and an eventual shot at winning it all in the Power Bowl!"

The first, player controlled buster will use proton pack and second, controlled by AI, uses the trap where ghosts end up, after been freezed by using the proton pack. Player controlled buster can get hurt, if touched by a ghost, while AI buster can't. ****The game's perspective is Top-Down, where you move from a one room to another and get rid of ghosts. The type of ghosts vary. After every level you have to fight against a boss, usually someone from the movie.

Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. ****If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. ****In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.

There is no NFLPA license, though, which means the 28 real teams are included, but no player names or faces.****The player is in control of the action from a side-scrolling perspective. The camera also zooms in for closeups on receiving plays. However, NFL is also a very strategic, coaching-oriented take on the sport, featuring large playbooks (team plays are included on a separate fold-out sheet bundled with the game manual, but not onscreen in the game itself), limited customization of team skills, and penalties.

The game was pitched somewhere in between a full-blown simulation like F1 GP and action games like Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps.****Before each race you can customize wing downforce, gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices – pitstops are a standard feature of the longer races.

Once they are all collected, they must be thrown into the high school  furnace to destroy Freddy once and for all (a plot similar to 1987's A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors).****Nightmare has two worlds. In the red-tinted ""real world,"" players fight snakes and spiders while navigating standard platform challenges. The players here have a ""sleep meter"" that depletes with every hit taken. If the player's sleep meter drops to empty, the game transitions into the blue-tinted ""dream world,"" where enemies take on the appearance of skeletons and ghosts. An invisible timer also starts, counting down until Freddy appears and forces the player into a brief boss battle. The sleep meter becomes a standard life gauge in the dream world, and deducts a life from the player if drained.****Players can find and collect three different icons in the dream world to become ""Dream Warriors"" with special powers and projectile attacks - both of which give a significant edge when fighting Freddy. Collecting all the bones in a level takes the player to a final level boss, usually taking the form of a monster with Freddy's face or trademark razor glove. Players move back and forth down Elm Street, and a new house opens up as the previous one is cleared.****Nightmare is compatible with the NES Four Score accessory, allowing up to four players to play at once using the same screen."

A ninja player can jump quite high and begins the game with a ninja throwing star weapon that can travel the length of the screen, although it's not very powerful. Other weapons are available for the taking throughout the levels, each with considerably less range than the stars but with more power. These weapons include a chain whip, a sword, and a bo staff.

He can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats.****Ryu will battle through urban city settings, forests, jungles, snow covered castles, underground railroads, and ancient castles.

Ryu is a ninja who can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to vertical walls and climb up and down, which is an ability missing in the previous game. Powerups are hidden everywhere throughout the levels. These powerups include fireballs and ninja stars as before; a unique new powerup is the ninja shadow. Ryu can collect up to 2 ninja shadows that follow his every movement and use the same weapons at the same time that Ryu strikes.****Ninja Gaiden II tells its story through liberal use of cinematic scenes interspersed between the action levels. Different levels feature a variety of environmental interaction; e.g., one level has Ryu on a high mountain where snow is falling fast and the wind is blowing hard. The shifting direction of the snowfall indicates how the wind is blowing and Ryu has to fight against the breeze. In a night level, much of the environment is dark and is illuminated only sporadically by flashes of lightning.

The real Ryu, angered over her death, and the subsequent false accusation that he murdered her, continues her mission and proceeds to investigate the factory.****As stated, this was the last game in the regular series produced for the NES. It had many features the previous games in the series did not, such as a power up to extend the length of your sword, a new vertical ""wave"" attack and vertically-scrolling levels. The US version of the game is reputed to be the hardest in the series, due to the extra damage incurred when hit, slightly shorter regular sword length, limited continues and more enemies.****The Lynx port is the second Ninja Gaiden game on the platform, the first being a port from the Arcade Version.

You can then give simple orders to you team-mates, like pass, tackle and shoot. Your moves are also limited to these moves. The game is totally lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles without a wink from the referee. Probably it was made this way to be funnier to play against friends.

One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. ****Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.****During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe &amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map.

When fuel is low, you can head to Vern's Orb-O-Rama and use earned credits to refuel your Orb. ****Included with the game is a pair of 3-D glasses which can give the game a more 3 dimensional appearance, though they aren't required for gameplay.

Pictionary - The Game of Video Quick Draw (USA)>Pictionary - The Game of Video Quick Draw>1990>ESRB - E (Everyone)>LJN Toys, Ltd.>Software Creations Ltd.>Board Games>1>1-8 Players>Based on the board game, the object is to guess either a word or phrase based on a drawing. Each team starts on the same square on the board and the first team attempts to draw a picture based on a clue.  If his team correctly guesses the clue, then this team gets to roll the dice and advance along the board.  If the team fails to guess correctly, then the other team gets a chance to draw and guess. The game plays much in this way until a team reaches the final square on the board and successfully guesses the clue to win the game.****This game contains three different modes; regular game, alternative game, and drawing practice. It also allows for up to four teams which can be made comprising of any number of players per each team. ****In the regular game, a team will be given a turn to start revealing pieces of one of the 500+ drawings that are hidden in the game. Each drawing is a 6x8 size and has 48 pieces to it. To reveal the pieces, the player is made to play one of four timed minigames which are chosen depending on the color of the square the player landed on the board. The minigames consist of Attack of the Paint Zombies, The WareHouse Shuffle, Leapin' Energy Capsules!, and Four Alarm Rescue. In Attack of the Paint Zombies the player fires downwards at the aliens and the more aliens that are hit the more pieces that are revealed of the drawing. If the aliens hit the player, the player loses time off the clock. In The WareHouse Shuffle, the player goes all the way to the left side and then stacks as many boxes on top of each other that they can bring over all the way to the right side. While transporting the boxes, their are two enemies who can hit into your boxes thus subtracting them from the haul and also taking time away. Each box brought over reduces a piece of the hidden drawing. In  Leapin' Energy Capsules!, the player is an astronaut and is moving and jumping to collect blue spheres. While collecting the spheres the player must try to avoid hitting any enemies which will reduce time. Each sphere collected clears up another piece of the drawing. In Four Alarm Rescue, the player controls a pair of firemen on the ground with a net who are moving back and forth catching the jumping people above on the net. Each person rescued leads a revealed piece of the drawing while each person not rescued leads to reduced time.****The alternative game allows the player to draw the picture for other players to guess, so their are no minigames in this mode. Other than that, it is the same as the regular mode.****Drawing practice lets the player practice their drawing technique without the pressure of a timer.

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.****Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.****Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of ""Connect 4""."

You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)****The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.
Pyramid (USA) (Unl)>Pyramid>1992>ESRB - E (Everyone)>American Video Entertainment Inc.>Thin Chen Enterprise>Puzzle>2.5>1 Player>Pyramid is an action puzzle game similar to Tetris. Stones of various shapes and sizes fall from the top of the screen, and you need to move and rotate the stones so they fill complete lines at the bottom of the screen. Should the stones reach the top of the screen the game is over. If you get in trouble, there are a limited number of bombs that can be used to clear a small section of stones at the bottom hopefully giving you more room to work with. Unlike the square and rectangular shaped pieces found in Tetris, each of the shapes in Pyramid have one or more angles to them making complete lines more difficult to form.

Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.

Drawing the rectangles using the ""slow"" method awards you the most points. Once a rectangle has been made, it will be colored in to show that you have claimed your territory. While drawing the rectangles, you need to watch out for Qix (pronounced ""kicks""), a series of colored lines that crawl the screen. In addition to Qix, you also need to avoid the Sparks who travel around the border, as well as any lines that you have made, as well as The Fuse, who travels along the line that you are drawing. Once you have claimed enough territory, you proceed to the next level."

The Rastons are after the crystals also, which places a short time limit on the mission. You are armed only with a spacesuit and a shockwave pistol. To retrieve the crystals, you will need to find your way through numerous mazes. Blocks in the maze can be moved with the shockwave pistol. When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.) Wandering about many of the levels are FireStars which will weaken your spacesuit and eventually destroy it. Each level has a time limit in which to solve the maze and retrieve all of the crystals.

The queen of the winter fairies chooses the novice wizard Dana to drive back the monsters. Solomon's Key 2 is a puzzle game seen from a side-view perspective. The goal in each level is to extinguish all flames by pushing or dropping blocks onto them. The player takes control of Dana who can create or destroy ice blocks, climb blocks and push loose blocks. Ice is created diagonally below Dana in the direction that he is facing, if there is already an ice block there, it will be destroyed. However, ice blocks cannot be created on a spot that is already occupied by a flame, so that the player will often have to find a way to create ice blocks next to or above a flame so that they can be pushed or dropped onto it. If an ice block is created next to another object or wall it will stick to it, meaning it can't be moved and won't fall down. It is therefor also possible to create ice bridges to get over chasms. When a loose ice block is pushed, it slides above the ground until it hits another object. Rocks can also be used to extinguish flames, but they are indestructible and only move one space when pushed (unless they are on an icy surface). Some levels contain pipes through which Dana can go, burning jars that melt ice or moving monsters instead of flames. There are ten worlds plus five secret worlds that contain ten levels. The first nine worlds can be played in any order. The tenth level of a world usually features a special challenge like moving flames or monsters and lava that is slowly rising from the bottom.The game also features an edit mode in which players can create their own levels.

Then imprison the human creatures in underwater factories where they can be turned into a fresh source of man-ham.****The plan goes perfectly. The leaders of earth's nations are taken completely by surprise as the ice-caps melt and the globe is flooded. It seems that humanity will meet its end on the dinner plates of the Neptunian monsters. But wait! One hope remains, in the form of evil pirate Narikeen, who has been the scourge of the world's nations, pillaging and causing general distress in his pink submarine, Sqoon.

When you have nine people on-board, a small mobile island will appear on the surface, allowing you to drop off the humans and re-fuel.

The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can't spot what the best move is.)

But what really makes Ultima IV shine is its radical departure from any other RPG made before or since in terms of the story and goal. ****Instead of building up your character by any means possible in order to face the Ultimate Evil in a big bang up showdown, in Ultima IV you were trying to become the Avatar, a role model of sorts for the people of the land. This meant upholding the ""eight virtues"" and basically trying to become a better person. In most RPGs you chose to be a just/nice hero because the people you'd help would usually provide you with some nice equipment for your services, but in Ultima IV you helped people not for a reward or to advance the plot but simply because it was the ""right thing to do"". The game actually frowns on behavior that was typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing monsters or picking up everything that wasn't nailed down even if it didn't belong to you. The game keeps track of all your actions, so if you went about killing and looting like in most RPGs, you'd never finish the game.****This VERY different approach to the game's ultimate goal is what makes Ultima IV famous so many years later, and became the sort of design philosophy that made all the following Ultimas so unique in their genre. ****Of course, the game still has plenty of traditional RPG elements such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill, as well as a typical final ""Holy Grail"" type quest where you had to find the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom to complete your transformation into Avatarhood."

Behind Blackthorn are the Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three Principles. Their meaning and origin are explored later in the game, rounding out an immersive world and very meaningful plot.

The game has a variety of different gameplay types. The stages go in the order of an overhead view stage, a side-scrolling stage, a climbing stage with the Android boss, and then a bomb disposal stage.****The overhead view stages deal with you driving either a car, boat, glider, or a dune buggy and trying to get to the end before time runs out on the clock. You must do this while either dodging or shooting enemies. In all the stages besides the one where you're given a glider you can use a limited number of turbo boosts to speed up your vehicle. In the glider stages you can alter your altitude to either go high above or below various obstacles. All of these levels end with a boss battle.****Sometimes after these stages there is a bonus round where you try to collect extras in a limited amount of time without crashing into any obstacles. Completing this successfully will yield an extra life.****The side-scrolling stages consists of two different experiences. One is a platformer where you walk around and can shoot enemies while searching for a set number of keys to unlock a forcefield at the end of the stage. The other consists of you flying a glider throughout a stage shooting enemies and trying not to crash until you get to the end of the stage.****The climbing stages consist of you climbing a building and shooting enemies with a reticle that you can move all over the screen.You have to get to the top of the building before time runs out. Once at the top you will have to fight an android boss. Such as Mega Slug, Techno Beast, and the Sand Yeti. The android boss fights take place on the buildings rooftops with a side view of the action. The player must drain the energy from the androids by repeated shooting bullets into them.****In the bomb disposal stage you must dispose of a bomb before the fuse burns all the way detonating it. You dispose the bomb by unsoldering chips away from each other. The player must use the directional pad to move the cursor from chip to chip keeping an eye on the number on each one. Every time the cursor moves to a certain block, the number on it decreases by one. This creates a puzzle-like scenario, where if the player makes a mistake he must reset the disposal and try again with less time.

In order to clear his name, Roger has  enlisted the help of Eddie Valliant, no-nonsense detective.

The sequel to the original Wizardry follows the defeat of the evil Werdna and the return of Mad Overlord Trebor's amulet. Following your party's success in that adventure, they were inducted into Trebor's personal honor guard. Unfortunately this particular honor didn't last very long as Trebor's madness and obsession with the amulet and preventing Werdna's return drove him to suicide.****With both Trebor and Werdna dead all seemed well within the kingdom of Llylgamyn. Unfortunately this peace didn't last very long. Besides Werdna, it seems that there was another evil fella living in Llylgamyn named Davalpus. With Werdna dead and out of the limelight, Davalpus felt it was time to make his move. He stormed the castle, slaughtered the royal family, and declared himself supreme dictator for life.****Don't worry, this game isn't about preparing for a big final battle with Davalpus. That's already been done for you. The Prince of the land fought and killed Davalpus using the legendary Staff of Gnilda and wearing the armor of the Knight of Diamonds. Unfortunately the god Gnilda, more than a bit ticked off with all this bickering, took the staff back and placed it deep within his heavily guarded six-level temple. Since the staff's power protects the land from invasion by hostile outlanders, someone will need to venture into the temple and get it back along with Gnilda's blessing. That someone is you.****In order to hold the staff one of your party members will need to retrieve all five pieces of the legendary armor and become the Knight of Diamonds. Only then may they quest for the staff and return it to it's rightful place. But beware, each of the the armor pieces is a living entities and will not be taken without a fight.****Wizardry II uses the same basic engine and graphics as the previous game. Players have the option of transferring characters from the previous Wizardry, or generating new characters from scratch.

You generate and control a party of up to six different adventurers and send them into a 3D vector dungeon to fight monsters and find treasure.****The game takes place in the domain of Trebor, the titular Mad Overlord. Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth is in fact his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard (and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process). Thus your goal in the game is to descend to the tenth floor of the labyrinth, defeat Werdna, and retrieve the fabled amulet.

Scientists are perplexed and decide that research on the inside of the earth is needed. To this end, an underground vehicle is constructed to explore the underworld. They call it the VZR, but the crew know it more commonly as a Wurm. Four different Wurms have already been dispatched and mysteriously disappeared, so a fifth Wurm vehicle is ready to launch crewed by the best and the brightest. Crew Chief Moby has been chosen to lead the mission, even though she has lost both her love and father on previous Wurm missions. It will be up to her and the crew to figure out this mystery and rescue the other Wurm members. There's also a matter of mysterious crystals that have been found underground...****Wurm: Journey to the Center of the Earth is a game featuring multiple sequences. The player controls the VZR vehicle, and occasionally Captain Moby when she ventures out on foot in vertically and horizontally scrolling sequences as well as a first person battle against enemy monsters. Players progress through 5 levels, in which the VZR-5 investigates the fate of the other VZRs. After the completion of each level, the player gains a crystal, which will unlock additional weapons for the VZR, mentioned below.****The VZR is controlled in both a side-scrolling sequence and a top-down vertically scrolling sequence. In the side-scrolling section, the VZR is able to change between Tank Mode and Hover Modes mode. In the top-view section, the VZR is able to change between Hover Mode and Aerial Mode. The Tank mode drives along the ground, firing in three directions and uses a drill to tear down obstacles. The Hover Mode can fly around the screen, but uses fuel constantly while doing so. Like the tank mode, It can also fire in three directions and has the drill, however the weapon can be changed to two power-ups: energy balls that fly across the screen and a wave weapon the shoots out in both directions. The Aerial Mode is a fighter jet form and sacrifices the obstacle-clearing drill for a laser weapon which bounces off of walls. In all forms, the VZR has a Life bar and a fuel bar, either of which will end the game if it runs out (though Tank mode does not use the fuel). Defeated enemies will sometimes drop fuel restore power-ups.****The VZR also engages enemy monsters in a first person shooter game. The player moves the perspective of the VZR left and right, and is able to fire the weapon. There is a ""Possibility"" percentage on the screen that determines when the player is able to kill the enemy creature. This possibility must reach 100% before the battle is over. In order to raise this possibility, the player can attack the monster's weak point... slowly driving it up, or the player can ""talk"" to crewmates on the VZR who will analyze the monster with sensors and move the the Possibility value up (or down). Players can also change between different weapons, some of which are more effective than others, all of which are fired the same way on the screen.****When Captain Moby leaves the VZR vehicle, the action changes to a side-scrolling platform game. Moby must navigate her way through a maze of different rooms, looking for the objects or persons required for her to open different locked doors. Moby's only abilities are a jump, a karate kick and a pistol. Moby has an ammo bar which determines how many times she can use her pistol, and a life bar, which ends the game if it runs out."

When the great head of the samurai, Namakubi hears about this, he sets out for the United States to defeat Darc Seed and reclaim the sword.****What makes this so unusual however is that ""great head of the samurai"" is to be taken literally and Namakubi therefore is a giant disembodied head. His main weapon is the ability to shoot projectiles from his eyes and bombs from his mouth which he fires at various enemies, objects and buildings. Furthermore, should a zombie hostage fall out a window he can rescue them to slowly power up his attacks.****The game is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player can control Namakubi's movement across the screen and the ability to shoot. Enemies reduce health by varying amounts, health can be restored by increasing the player's score. The game features four distinct stages with 2 difficulty settings."
