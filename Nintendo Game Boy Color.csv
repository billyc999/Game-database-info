In this game, you control the plucky little porker and direct his sheep management attempts, driving them forward toward the goal in exaggerated, frictionless Soko-Ban or Boulder Dash style with porcine barks until their movement is halted or altered should their course intercept an obstacle such as a fencepost, moveable haystack, pit or trampoline.****Babe is given hints and tips in these efforts by lovable characters from both of his feature films, and the 40 levels borrow inspiration both from the calm pastoral setting of the first and the surreal urban folly of its sequel.  While the measured puzzles are a far cry from the excitement of the movies, the material finds a surprisingly good fit in this unexpected genre -- or otherwise put, ""that'll do, pig."""

Ever wanted to hit pedestrians during a race?  Now's your chance. Carmageddon is an ultra-violent racing game which caused much controversy during the '90s but was also very popular due to its fun factor.

Damage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits for the player which can be used for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during the race.

Grand Theft Auto (USA)>Grand Theft Auto>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Rockstar Games>Tarantula Studios>Adventure>2.7>1 Player>"In Grand Theft Auto, the player takes the role of a small-time criminal trying to make it big with the mob. Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are the way to success.****The action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city: Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the **big points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple ""ditch-a-hot-car"" jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points.****Criminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime, the player's wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered.****The entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted). Dozens of different vehicles are available for the taking, each with unique characteristics: a bus will handle very differently than a sports car."

The goal is to win all 9 gold medals by obtaining more points than the competition. Arcade mode is the same, except all championships and stages, as well as Jeremy McGrath, are unlocked from the start.**The difference between championships is the engine size - with larger (thus faster) bikes, the player has less time to react, and going head to head into the edge of the track can be a matter of a simple bump in 80cc to a spectacular flip into the stands in 250cc, also because it becomes a lot harder to do sharp turns in a limited space.****While it can be played as a straightforward racing game, by performing tricks the player can obtain some powerups - a bomb will knock down the next opponent, the arrow temporarily boosts bike stats and the shield allows the player to barge into one opponent, knocking him off his bike. There is one big catch - the skull and bones knock the player out of his bike, which can prove to be decisive in a close race.

You as a good cowboy and law keeper have to catch them and return them back, finishing 12 levels of the game.****Players guide Luke through levels by walking, jumping, climbing and ducking.  There are also objects to collect such as dynamite (which can be used to reveal hidden paths), revolver barrels, sheriff stars and other useful items.  You also have to use collected items to get past a certain obstacle, such as to show a red cloth to a bull, feed a dog with a bone, and so on. Luke can attack enemies by shooting in straight or diagonal directions.  Shooting exhausts the six bullets in your gun's barrel. To kill the bandits, bad Indians, prisoners, you should shoot at them for a certain number of times.****Locations of the levels vary from towns, saloons, and jails, to the prairies, ranches, and Indian village in Cheyenne Mountains. At the end of most levels you have to challenge one of the bosses, and at the end of the final level you should challenge four Daltons one after another again.****Some levels are scrolling arcades such as stagecoach traveling, chasing a train, escaping the Tornado or Buffalo, or flowing in the rapids.

Lufia - The Legend Returns (USA)>Lufia - The Legend Returns>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Ubisoft>Neverland Co., Ltd>Role-Playing>3.5>1 Player>The third title of the Lufia series gives us an entirely new battle and dungeon system. All of the dungeons in this game are randomly generated, which can get annoying at times. Otherwise, it's a lot like Lufia 2 in the dungeon department. You see the monsters, they move when you move and you can stun them.****The battle system in this game is rather unique. You can use 9 characters in a 3x3 formation. The character in the front row deals the most physical damage, but also takes the most physical damage. Vice versa for the back row one, and the one in the middle row obviously takes and deals average damage. 9 characters might seem like much to use, but you can only let 3 characters attack during a turn; One from each vertical row. ****The 3x3 system is also used for special attacks and magic systems. Each character has a power in one colour; Blue, green, yellow or red, which means magic, defense, speed or power respectively. The other characters who are in the same vertical or horizontal row also receive the same amount of power from this character; This way, all characters share their power with eachother. ****Other than that, the story circles around the Sinistrals returning - Again. Another thing that has returned is the Ancient Dungeon, but this time around, it has 200 floors and a very difficult and unexpected boss at the bottom...

The faster you perform these tasks, the better ranking you will receive (again, with a gold star as your ultimate goal).

This time however, you don't get to race cars, boats or any other type of vehicle, but micro men. Most courses are on foot, but others allow you to take small vehicles such as jet skis and skate boards.****The game offers a variety of micro men to play with, ranging from mutants, cyborgs, mad professors, experiments gone wrong, and other strange characters. They all have their own special weapon to give them an edge in the races. There are 32 races which are organised by a mad doctor who hopes to find the ultimate soldier among these micro maniacs.****The Game Boy Color version is completely in 2D. In good Micro Machines tradition, the races are all held in and around the house, including the garage, living room, bathroom, study and deck.
Microsoft - The 6 in 1 Puzzle Collection Entertainment Pack (USA)>Microsoft - The 6 in 1 Puzzle Collection Entertainment Pack>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Classified Games>Conspiracy Entertainment  Corp.>Puzzle>3.3>1 Player>6 Puzzle Games designed by Alexey Pajitnov, the original Tetris designer, on one Gameboy Color cartdridge.****Jewel Chase. A level based game. Every level consists of a labyrinth of colored pathways, scattered valuables, locked doors, keys, a thief (the player), on some levels an opposing thief and a door marked exit. The goal is to reach the exit to proceed to the next level, valuables can be 'stolen' for score. If the opposing (computer controlled) thief reaches the exit before the player, the game is lost. Movement is not possible between differently colored tiles, unless a special, multicolor 'bridge' stone is used. 99 levels total.****Spring weekend. A rotation puzzle, where a given pattern needs to be recreated by rotating elements on the playfield.****Lineup. Using 'Tetris' style blocks, a continuous line from a screen border to an opposite screen border needs to be build. Elements appear on an element stack, and can be selected freely from that and subsequently placed anywhere on screen, without overlapping each other. If the element stack is full, the game is over. As soon as a line is complete, the elements of that line are removed from the screen. Elements appear faster over time.****Finty Flush. A grid on top of the screen fills slowly with multicolor balls. The player can pick one out of 4 squares on the bottom of the screen to shift balls in one line into and out of these squares. The squares can be rotated in 90 degree steps. As soon as any square is completely full with balls of the same color, its content empties to make room for more balls. 3 filled square grids grant a bonus point, and the next level begins (tiles appear faster). The game is over when the upper grid is full.****Color Collison. A 'Qix' style ray ( no better way to describe this - for the younger audience - imagine a flapping fan ) moves with increasing speed through a screen full of obstacles. The player can only indirectly control it - any time the direction pad is pressed, it gets 'reflected' into the direction that has been indicated. Objective is to hit obstacles with a given color and pattern, avoiding all other elements. To top things of, the patterns change over time.**The game ends if the wrong obstacles have been hit too many times.****Rat Poker. Little differently colored rats are automatically fed into labyrinths, with labyrinth design changing and getting more complex during level progression. Switches allow rerouting of the rats to arrange certain color combinations ('hands') of rats. If a given combination is achieved, the contributing rats exit the playfield through a door. You progress to the next level if a given number of rats has been removed from the game. The game ends if there is no space left on the playfield for additional rats.

Monkey Puncher (Europe)>Monkey Puncher>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Event Horizon Software>Atelier Double Co.

You can choose to play as either a boy or a girl character; the one you do not pick is your sibling. ****Shortly after starting the game you are given your first monkey, Freddy. You can train him in skipping, using a punchbag, doing sit-ups, running and even going shopping. There is also a sixth activity, called sparring. These activities work to improve his speed, power, strength, stamina, knowledge and (for the latter activity) all of these, although only by a small amount.****In all of the aforementioned apart from shopping, you train your monkey by getting him to copy your actions; your actions are controlled by the rhythmic pressing of the A button. After a while, your monkey should be able to imitate your actions with ease, eventually being able to start the activity without prompting. In regards to shopping, you can send him out to buy what you want from a selection of items, or just let him go out and buy what he likes. This is a good way of obtaining certain items that are otherwise unobtainable. The rarity of items and the accuracy of which items it brings home from your shopping list increases as its knowledge does. Sparring involves pitting your own monkey against a computer controlled one in order to raise every stat by a small amount. Finally, you can 'date' your monkeys, either with each other, with a friend's monkey or in the dating shop available within the game. This is a good way of obtaining monkeys with higher stats, depending on which monkeys you breed and with whom. ****During boxing matches, you do not have direct control over your monkey, but in between bouts you can do things such as refill its health, stamina, or both. You can also advise it on what strategy to use against its opponent. These matches are won by either a count or by KO'ing the opponent, however if time runs out before there is a clear winner, the winner is the monkey who is left with the most health at the end of the match.

Other obstacles besides enemies are closed doors which have to be opened with keys, conveyor belts, teleporters, disappearing platforms or the time limit. Power ups grant temporary advantages such as the ability to walk through enemies or kill them by touch.

Scrabble (Europe)>Scrabble>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Ubisoft>Runecraft>Board Games>4.3>1 Player>"Until now, Scrabble has generally been reserved for days when you're stuck inside during the British summer holidays when it's raining. But the little game with the letter tiles has made it onto the Game Boy, so now you can have all of that scrabbly goodness in the palm of your hand. As well as the standard game--where you get some letters, make spellings up and then shout ""what do you mean there's no such word as QXZYJHD?"", there is also a conundrum round where you and your opponents get the same seven letters and have to arrange them into a word.  You can play against up to three other players (either computer players or friends--although you'll all have to use the same machine as the game doesn't make use of the link cable). If you play against the computer you can choose a difficulty level--Novice, Easy, or Hard--and the pictorial representation of the opponent changes depending on which level you play, from a man with a dunce's hat to the expert who looks like Einstein. It's a nice touch which gives you the impression of playing against someone rather than just the computer AI. There are also various options you can choose to spice up play: you can set ""word challenge"" to on so that your opponent can dispute a word you put down (otherwise the dictionary will do it automatically when you place your tiles; the intelligence of this changes as you go up difficulty levels), and you can also turn off the ""miss a turn"" function when you get a word wrong. It's very simple to pick up and play, and the board is reproduced in the original colours. Basically, this is a very addictive game for people of all ages."
