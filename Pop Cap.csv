Alchemy Deluxe>Alchemy Deluxe>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>PopCap Games>PopCap Games>Puzzle>4.0>1 Player>The object of this puzzle game is to turn all squares on the board from lead to gold. You do this by placing rune symbols on squares of the board but they must go next to an already occupied space. They must also either be of the same shape or colour of any other symbols to the right/left and top/bottom of it. A grey stone acts as a wild card and can be placed anywhere and any symbol can be placed next to it. A skull has to be placed on an occupied square and will destroy anything on it.   If one whole row or column of symbols is filled, all symbols on it will disappear. If there is nowhere to place a symbol, you can discard it into a forge. The molten level in the forge will rise with every discarded rune but will lower if another is placed on the board. However, if 4 consecutive are discarded then the game is over. There are three levels of difficulty, each with more different types and colors of runes.

You start the game on an empty field with just a shovel and a bag of tomatoe seeds. Your goal is to dig up the field, plant seeds, water them and watch them grow. When they are ripe, you harvest them and bring them to the market where you sell them.  During the game you get access to more crops and other items that will help you create your garden. Various events also happen from time to time. You can for example inherit money from a distant relative, or get an offer to buy a book. These event affect the various meters in the game, such as wealth and knowledge.  The goal of the game is to max out your stat meters and money, but many people play just to create a beautiful garden. After 30 ""days"" the game ends and your achievement is rated, ranging from F to A+.  A thing that makes this game stand out from other simulation games is the fact that practically everything you do is performed by Alice herself in real time, rather than controlling the game from a ""god perspective"" kind of view."

Amazing Adventures Riddle of the Two Knights>Amazing Adventures Riddle of the Two Knights>2012>ESRB - E (Everyone)>PopCap Games>SpinTop Games>Puzzle>2.2>1 Player>Following the tradition established by previous installments of the series, Riddle of the Two Knights is a hidden object game with a vast collection of mini-games. The player assumes the role of an adventurer who is sent out by the museum to collect chess figures that belong to a recently unearthed chessboard from the middle ages. There is one significant change from the previous games - instead of one mini-game that follows one hidden object screen, all the mini-games are huddled together at the very end of each mission. There are 25 missions in total, each containing one to seven hidden object screens (25 different locations throughout Europe and the Mediterranean) and several mini-games. The mini-games include jigsaw-puzzle, rotating puzzle, position-swapping puzzle, find-words, mahjong, sliding tiles puzzle and seek-two-or-more mini-game. All actions taken by the player are awarded by points - 2000 for finding an item, extra points for finding items in quick succession, fifteen thousand points for finding all of the items without using the hint button, correctly made step in mini-game etc. The player can lose points as well - by using the hint button or by repeated miss-clicking in the screen. One can play with time-limit or without it, with slowly re-charging hint button or with immediately available one. Apart from the regular items or clues that have to be found to finish every hidden object scene, there are two items unlisted. In this instalment of the series the player should look for crowns - after collecting all fifty of them, two bonus modes are accessed: unlimited search for hidden objects on all maps and seek-two-or-more mini-game.

Amazing Adventures: The Caribbean Secret is the third entry in a series of hidden object titles with minimal plot and basic seek-and-find gameplay. Most of the time, the objective is to find and click on all the items listed at the bottom of the screen, on locations filled with assorted objects, within a time limit. The time and hint limits can be turned off in the options menu. Besides the list entries, there are two skulls on each screen that can be collected to unlock bonus modes. Some of the list entries are instructions about some action that has to be performed on the scene, like dragging and dropping an item to a specific place or object in the scenery. Clue entries have riddles about the object instead of its name.  There are mini-games at the end of each level, with implementations of well-known concepts like a tile-matching game where two adjacent tiles have to be swapped on a grid to make them disappear, a word search challenge, a spot-the-differences game with two similar pictures, a variation of the differences game where the player has to replace the missing bits between two similar images, jigsaw and picture puzzles, a memory game with pairs of identical figures, and other similar challenges."
Amazing Adventures The Forgotten Dynasty>Amazing Adventures The Forgotten Dynasty>2011>ESRB - E (Everyone)>PopCap Games>SpinTop Games>Puzzle>3.0>1 Player>The Forgotten Dynasty is an installment in the Amazing Adventures hidden object game series. The player is again a historian sent out by a museum. The destination is China: strange artifacts have surfaced in the black market and there are also rumours about the unknown, forgotten dynasty that could be older than the oldest known Emperor. In 25 different locations the player has to find hidden items or, rarely, perform an action with given items (e.g. find a match, light a candle with it and then put it into the lantern). For every successful action the player is rewarded with points. One can gain more points for discovery in quick succession from the previous one or lose points for using the hint system. The main mission is divided in 25 missions. Each is divided into two to seven levels. Each hidden object level is followed by mini-game, e.g. spot ten differences, jigsaw puzzles, memory game or a match-three game. In addition, in every hidden object location there are two yin and yang symbols. After finding all 50 symbols, two bonus modes are unlocked: unlimited access to all hidden object locations and unlimited levels of match-three games.  The game offers two modes of difficulty. The first is limited by time and longer times between recharging the hint button. The relaxed mode removes the time limit and the hints are given at any time. For every completed mission the player is rewarded with several Mahjong titles and a short, educational description about various aspect of the Chinese culture, history or other trivia.

AstroPop Deluxe>AstroPop Deluxe>2004>ESRB - E (Everyone)>PopCap Games>PopCap Games>Puzzle>3.6>1 Player>AstroPop is an arcade puzzle game with similar gameplay to Magical Drop. The objective is to guide a space ship that stacks and shoots bricks. As the amount of bricks on top of the screen increases, you need to pop a target number of bricks with matching colours before the rows reach the bottom of the screen. By linking four bricks or more, you create chain reactions. To spice up the gameplay, there are special power-ups such as radial bombs, freeze bombs, column nukes and difficult obstacles such as toxic, steel and stone bricks.  Each of the four playable characters has a supa weapon that destroys all bricks on the screen. It can only be used after charging it. There are two playing modes: Classic with weapon upgrades and 32 levels per character and Survival in which you need to stay alive as long as possible.
Atomica Deluxe>Atomica Deluxe>2002>ESRB - E (Everyone)>PopCap Games>PopCap Games>Puzzle>3.1>1 Player>Atomica Deluxe is a tile-matching puzzle game where players need to form molecules by moving atoms around the grid. The most straightforward molecule is a square form of four atoms of the same colour, but more complex patterns using different colours are also possible. The game can be played turn-based, with new atoms appearing after every move, or real-time where the game progresses regardless of the player's actions. For each of these modes, there is also an expert version with many more colours.  To progress through the levels, players need to form a certain amount of molecules before empty space on the grid is taken up entirely. For each group, a molecule meter near the top of the screen is filled, showing the level progress. Atoms are moved around using the mouse and can be placed anywhere on the grid, as long as there is a direct route possible without other atoms blocking the path. Points are awarded for each molecule formed, causing it to disappear from the grid. New atoms that appear on the grid are hinted at with a faded, coloured symbol, which can be incorporated in the strategy.  By forming combos, a geiger meter is filled. Multiple combos trigger a super combo and the different combos charge up an atomic bomb that can be used to blow up random atoms on the grid. When enough molecules are formed, the player is offered to form a more complex, bonus molecule using more advanced shapes and different colours. Upon completing it, a bonus atom is provided on the grid. It can be moved around to form a group (opening the option to get a more powerful bonus atom) or it can be double clicked to trigger it. For instance, the level 1 fire bonus atom will clear nine squares on the grid, but an advanced one will destroy more. There are also time-limited biohazard atoms that need to be disposed off quickly before they start replicating.  The game includes a high score list and saves the level progress

Bejeweled 3>Bejeweled 3>2010>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Electronic Arts, Inc.>PopCap Games>Puzzle>3.9>1 Player>Bejeweled 3 returns to the traditional match three formula after the slightly different spin off Bejeweled Twist. As in previous games, the player is presented with a board filled with gems of different colours. The aim of the game is to remove gems from the board by swapping adjacent gems so that a chain of three or more gems is created. New gems will then be generated at the top of the screen and fall down in the empty spaces. This can lead to a chain reaction when gems fall down and create new matches. New in Bejeweled 3 is that the player can continue swapping gems during a chain reaction. There are some special gems; flame gems are created from a match of four gems and explode when matched, thereby removing surrounding gems. A match of five gems will create a hypercube which can be matched with any adjacent gem and then destroy all gems of that colour. Star gems are created by T- or L-shaped matches and destroy all gems that are right, left, up and down of the it.  The game has four game modes: classic, zen, lightning, and quest. Classic is the original concept known from previous games. It is untimed and ends when no further moves are possible. The zen mode is meant for relaxation and has no end. Here the player can turn on various audio-visual effects. These are breath modulation, ambient sounds, mantras and binaural beats. Lightning is a timed mode and ends when the time is out. The standard time is one minute but by matching special time gems more time is added. The quest mode consists of a number of challenges. The player has to activate relics and each challenge corresponds to a relic.  There are also four additional secret modes that are extended versions of quest mode challenges. These are poker, butterflies, ice storm, and diamond mine. In poker mode, the player has to make poker hands with gem matches. For example, two of a gem type is a pair. The butterflies mode has special butterfly gems that move up from the bottom. These have to be matched before they reach the top. In the ice storm mode, ice moves up the board and the player has to make matches to knock it down again. In the diamond mine mode the lower part of the playing field is filled with rocks. The player has to dig through it by matching gems that are adjacent to it. By doing so gold coins, artifacts and diamonds can be mined from the rock.
Bejeweled Blitz>Bejeweled Blitz>2010>ESRB - E (Everyone)>PopCap Games>PopCap Games>Puzzle>3.7>1 Player>Bejeweled Blitz is a free to play Bejeweled game that can be played on the PopCap website or on Facebook.  The game plays similar to normal Bejeweled but with a strict time trial of 60 seconds. The player swaps gems to line up three or more of a kind. When successful the gems are removed from the game and gems fall downwards with new gems filling up the playing field at the top. Various special gems can supply score multipliers or destroy all gems in a row, column or of a specific color.  The player can collect coins (special yellow gems) to buy power-ups. Power-ups give the player special options or more time and last for three games before they expire. The player can only have 3 power-ups at the same time.  The aim of Blitz is to gain the highest score. Scores are compared with Facebook friends that also have the game installed. Scores are reset every week. There is also a cooperative element involved as the player gains a team score based on the combined score of all friends playing the game. This score gives the player a shot in the weekly tournaments with real prizes.  The Blitz game mode is also included in Bejeweled 2 for the iPhone. Players from all platforms compete in the same tournament.
Bejeweled Deluxe>Bejeweled Deluxe>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>PopCap Games>PopCap Games>Puzzle>3.4>1 Player> The object of the game is to score as many points as possible by swapping adjacent gems to create sets, either horizontal or vertical, of 3 or more identical gems.  Controls  Swap any two adjacent gems by clicking on one, then the one you want to swap it with. The gems must be adjacent vertically or horizontally (not diagonally).  You must create a valid set of three or more identical gems with each move, or the gems will revert back to their original position.  Sets can be either horizontal or vertical, and can contain more than 3 gems. When you have successfully created a set, they will disappear and new gems will fall into place, possibly creating a chain reaction or 'cascade' of more sets.  You can also swap gems by clicking on one, then dragging it in the direction you want to swap. This can be faster and more efficient once you're used to it!
Bejeweled Twist>Bejeweled Twist>2008>ESRB - E (Everyone)>PopCap Games>PopCap Games>Puzzle>3.7>1 Player>Bejeweled Twist is a tile matching game, where the player rotates groups of four jewels to create rows and columns of three or more matching gems. In the Classic and Zen modes, the objective is to make enough matches to fill a tube at the left side of the screen to move to the next level. There's a chain meter at the top of this tube, that builds up with matches in a row multiplying the points, and making a fruit jewel appear when full. A box at the tube bottom shows the sequence of matches needed for bonus points.  Obstacles appear randomly on the game board. The coal can't be matched, but it can be exploded by one of the power-ups gems. The locked jewel is chained to its place and can't move, but it can be removed with a match. Bomb gems display the number of moves allowed before they explode, destroying the board and ending the game. They have to be matched before their counters reach zero, otherwise a revolving wheel-of-fortune appears that stops in one of two values, skulls or gems, that either detonate or disarm the bomb. This mini-game becomes more difficult every time it comes up.  The power-ups appear after making matches of four or more gems. A four jewel match creates the flame gem, that explodes when matched removing all surrounding jewels. A five jewel match creates the lightning gem, that destroys a column and a row at the same time in a cross of fire.  With the exception of Classic Mode, the other modes are unlocked with continuous playing. Zen Mode is similar to Classic, but is more relaxed without the bomb and locked jewels. Challenge Mode is a puzzle mode, where the objective is to perform a task, like removing all gems of one color, or making a number of matches in a row. In Blitz Mode, the goal is to accumulate the maximum amount of points possible within a time limit.

A level consists of a geometric figure, divided into squares, filled with different aquatic items (pearls, mussels, starfishes, etc.).

After completing a certain amount of levels, you will unlock different fishes for your personal reef, totaling in 22 different species. In the My Fish Screen, you can set up a new reef, releasing fishes or group of fishes into your own reef and you can even watch your own ""aquarium"" as long as you want. When you continue your game, this particularly reef will be used as the background, and all the fishes will eventually swim through the game.  The game offers two different game modes, whereby the only difference is that the one is time based (playing against the clock), while the other is without any time limits, where you can play a level as long as you want.  Finally, Big Kahuna Reef offers a level editor, so you can create your own levels, when those 150 aren't enough."

The main game interface is a 4x4 grid of letters, and unlike in the original Bookworm game, the letters do not need to connect to form words. The game is turn-based, and after the user attacks their opponent, the opponent then takes its turn. Each book is divided into 10 chapters that culminate in a ""boss battle"" in which the player is rewarded with a treasure upon defeating the enemy. Treasures do many things, ranging from increasing damage for using certain letters, to stunning the enemy, and a whole lot more. A player can only choose 3 treasures to bring with them into a chapter (out of an eventual total of 31).  The game is part RPG, part word game. Eventually, the player will find that enemies can cause status ailments such as poison, bleeding, burning, stun, petrification, etc. These range from causing damage over time, to loss of a turn, to weakening their attacks. Through the use of certain treasures, items and special gem tiles, the player can cause similar inflictions to the enemy. In addition, after defeating a monster the player is awarded experience points, which will lead to a level up which imparts a bonus of either extra health, attack power increase, or defensive ability increased.  The player is rewarded with gem tiles for spelling words of longer length (and also by using certain treasures which increase their frequency of appearance). Enemies will also sometimes drop potions. Health potions refill the user's health meter, attack potions increase their attack power by 50% and purify potions clear the player and tile grid of all status ailments.  The game also includes an Arena mode (unlocked after completing all 3 books) in which the player can fight in real-time against all the bosses of the game. Every 5 opponents, the player is awarded one of each potion type and is allowed to change the 3 treasures they have equipped. Players are rewarded for spelling lots of short words quickly, attacking first, attacking many times before an enemy gets an attack in, defeating the opponent in 1-3 turns, and more.

Chuzzle Deluxe>Chuzzle Deluxe>2005>ESRB - E (Everyone)>PopCap Games>Raptisoft>Puzzle>3.9>1 Player>"Chuzzle Deluxe is a tile matching puzzle game with 4 different game modes and trophies for special events.  Basically, you have a 6x6 rows big screen, filled with different colored Chuzzles (some sort of pets). Unlike other tile matching games, you don't move the tile (in this case the Chuzzle), but you actually move the entire row so that you get 3 same colored Chuzzles in a group. They then ""explode"" and the gap is filled with new Chuzzles. Row moving is possible due to the fact that the rows (both horizontal and vertical) are ""round"", meaning that moving the outer left Chuzzle one tile to the left will result in appearing of it at the outer right position.  The four different game modes are: Classic, Speed, Zen and Mind Bender.  Classic works like explained above, but you will also face mega Chuzzles (2x2 tiles big) which can't move out of the screen and locks, which will lock the two rows where it is located. Locks can be destroyed by making a match (mega Chuzzles by the way too). The game mode is level based. Just score as much points as needed for the level and you proceed with the next one. If you run out of possible matches, you can scramble the screen (basically this equals the lost of a life).  Speed is like Classic, but you play against the clock. With each match, the counter is set a bit back, but as soon as the counter reaches the top, one Chuzzle will be locked. This goes until no moves are possible. Once you completed the level, the locks are reset.  Zen is a relaxing mode. No locks and no clock.  In Mind Bender, you job is to recreate a certain given pattern with your 36 Chuzzles. No clock and no special level order required to play.  For the first three game modes, if you don't know any further, you can buy a hint (reduction of the score).  The major feature of the game are the trophies. In the Trophy Room, you see 22 placeholders for trophies, which will be awarded as soon as you met the requirements. Those are for example for seven-step cascades (you make one match, which will trigger six additional matches), beating 10 levels of Classic, making a six tiles long match, or playing a game without using a hint and much much more."

Dynomite Deluxe>Dynomite Deluxe>2002>ESRB - E (Everyone)>PopCap Games>Raptisoft>Puzzle>4.4>1 Player>"Dynomite is a revised version of Raptisoft's Eggsucker and has similar gameplay to Bust-A-Move. You launch colored dino eggs upwards from a swivable slingshot launcher to break groups of slowly descending egg patterns. At least 3 of similar color must be touching for them to break and large groups cracked elicit a witty shout from a dino character and bonus points. Cracking groups in succession will also bring shouts of ever increasing ""combos"" until a bomb is rewarded which explodes a large area of any eggs it contacts and pushes the descending egg field upwards temporarily.  Some eggs will shake and if they are cracked in time, a dino baby will hatch giving a bonus. Certain eggs will also, if cracked, give extra points, mutiply scores, widen the play area, or show the route path of your launched egg for easy targeting.  There are four different play modes:  Endless Mode - eggs continue falling at ever increasing speeds. Occasionally when a timer runs down, a pterodactyl named Whirly will fly from the bottom of the screen and if not hit before he reaches the screen top, will drop a new color of egg making the game harder. He will fly ever faster each time he appears and is shot.  Stomped Mode - Each screen is a set pattern of eggs that all must be cleared to move to another screen. Every set number of eggs fired, Mama Brontosaurus will stomp the screen down one row.  Fossil Challenge - A prehistoric fossil trapped among the eggs must be freed by cracking all eggs surrounding it. There's two submodes - Strategic, where the screen remains static or Panic, where it will descend one row for every set number of shots taken.  Time Trial - Simply clear all eggs in the quickest time possible in a choice of 3 different difficulty levels."

The main objective is to find and click on all the items from a list at the bottom of the screen, on locations around the island filled with assorted objects, within a time limit. Some of the list items have riddles instead of the object name, like ""collects nuts"" for a squirrel, ""cuts paper"" for a pair of scissors, and so on.

A new mode called ""Unlimited Seek & Find"" is available at the main menu after completing the game and finding all the fifty locks, where the goal is to find every single item from each location as fast as possible.  The mini-games that appear between the stages are versions of classic casual games. There are implementations of concentration, jigsaw puzzles, circle puzzles, word search and tile-matching titles. In the circle puzzle, a scrambled picture is divided in circular segments, and the objective is to rotate each ring until it is in the correct position. In the tile-matching mini-game, the player has to swap two adjacent tiles in a grid and connect three or more matching figures to make them disappear, breaking the background layer to complete the level."

Once a power is fully ready, a random gem lights up inside the board. Match it and an attack (or some other effect) is unleashed upon your enemy. Chaining up matches make your energy rise faster, while failing to make a match makes your foe's energy rise quickly. Kill your enemy and you gain experience points to level up your beasts; if your beast reaches 0HP, it will have to sit out of battles for the remainder of the level.

While playing, there are additional hearts to be collected, as well as gold treasure chests, cupids and strawberries.  Money can be used to upgrade the hammer's speed or power in the shop (only available when you whack a shop gnome) or to buy additional lives. There are various achievements, stored in a trophy screen. These are awarded as milestones when 1,000 gnomes are hit or when a certain number of points has been scored. For extra points, perfect accuracy or lightning-fast reflexes are needed to score chains of bashed gnomes.  The different types of gnomes provide an additional challenge. Some need to be hit multiple times, or only at specific moments (e.g. when they put a bucket on their head, or remove their helmet). Every five levels, the player acquires a camera to take a snapshot and save the game.

Iggle Pop Deluxe>Iggle Pop Deluxe>2006>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Sprout Games>Sprout Games>Action>2.8>1 Player>In this fast-paced, arcade-like game, players choose to be one of the four available characters (with different difficulty levels) to help doctor Iggle free the small furry creatures known as Iggles. They have been trapped by the evil Zoogs who locked them up in bubbles. In 150 levels divided over ten chapters, players need to rescue the Iggles from their cages in different mazes and bring them to safety.  The game offers two main modes to play. In Adventure Game, the Iggle can move around in the maze and walk over the bubbles with his trapped friends to get them to trail behind him (somewhat similar to the Snake games). The Iggles come in four colours and need to be delivered at the transportation point with the corresponding colour. The colour of the trail can be in any order, but identically coloured Iggles forming a single line provide more points, leading to combos. The enemy Zoogs come in different flavours and try to trap the player's character. Some simply walk around, while others have fixed patterns or shoot bubbles. When they touch the trail, it is cut off, sending the Iggles loose or trapping them again. To complete a level, the player has to free all Iggles.  New techniques and features are introduced gradually through short tutorial sessions with doctor Iggle between the missions. The main Iggle can collect letters to earn extra lives, walk with the correct number of Iggles in the trail through a chain bonus pad to unlock diamonds, walk into a pad to sort the colours, freeze enemies, shortly activate electricity to hunt the Zoogs, and more. He can also get a short burst of speed, but this needs to be recharged. After completing a set of levels, a bonus level is played where a hidden bomb and an extra life is introduced, along with secret passages. These levels have a time limit. The Iggle can be controlled both using the keyboard or the mouse.  The second mode, Retro Game, keeps most of the game elements, but resembles Pac-Man in gameplay. Instead of forming a trail, the mazes are filled with more Iggles and they can be collected right away. without having to take them along to a transportation point. When the player is out of lives, it is possible to continue in the Adventure Game mode, while a Game Over is final in the Retro Game mode. The game supports both local and global, online high scores.

Each fish drops various coins and trinkets; the larger and more picky the fish, the more valuable the trinkets he drops, from simple silver coins to fancy gold chests. Additionally, every once in a while a vicious alien will appear in the aquarium, trying to slaughter hapless fish and ending the whole enterprise prematurely.  Another twist comes in the form of pets. At the end of every level players are awarded a pet, which floats in the aquarium without demanding maintenance and adds some sort of beneficial bonus. Players are limited to using a maximum of three pets at a time.  Managing the various fish, fighting aliens, and making the right choices (from pets to various investments in the aquarium) gives the game a slight strategic appeal. The game also supports additional challenges such as time-trials, and includes a Virtual Aquarium which players can nurture purely for pleasure.

The player is challenged to drag the mouse cursor over chains of 3 or more identical pieces in order to make the pieces vanish, the score increase, and the other pieces reshuffle. A certain number of each type of piece on each game board must be collected in this manner before time runs out for that board. There are also magic spells that rearrange the pieces on the board or swap 2 pieces of the player's choosing, useful for when the board reaches a state where no more chains of 3 are available.  Magic Match features an elaborate tale in which the player is actually a wizard's apprentice traveling across a fantasy landscape on a quest. The player progresses through 6 stages with many levels of increasing difficulty and earns higher magic ranks with better scores. The game features an imp named Giggles who tutors you as you play and helps explain extra options and obstacles that appear on the game board (such as a coin that acts as a wildcard piece or a plus sign that will grant bonus time to complete the board).  Magic Match also allows for dueling options. Either a human player can play against the computer with configurable difficulty, or 2 humans can play against each other using what the game calls ""Mouse Party""-- 2 mice hooked up to the same computer."

Mummy Maze Deluxe>Mummy Maze Deluxe>2002>ESRB - E (Everyone)>PopCap Games>PopCap Games>Board Games>3.8>1 Player>"Mummy Maze Deluxe is an electronic adaptation of the pencil-and-paper maze puzzle Theseus and the Minotaur by Robert Abbott, first published in 1962. It is based on the concept of logic mazes where an exit needs to be found, but with a number of rules that restrict or modify the possible movement. Locating the exit does not consist of travelling towards it directly, the introduced limitations can be based on arrows restricting directions, opened or closed doors, or the amount of spaces each move is permitted to be. The name of the maze is based on the Greek legend of Theseus who needs to outsmart the stronger and faster minotaur in his own labyrinth.  In PopCap's take on the concept, the setting is moved to Egypt where the player controls an explorer in search of treasure. Instead of minotaurs, the explorer encounters different types of mummies and scorpions. The level lay-out of the mazes is seemingly simple, but usually a large number of steps is needed to enter the exit. Played in turns, mummies can move two steps at a time, while the explorer is limited to one. To outsmart enemies, they need to be lured away. Enemies do not react to the player directly, but to a specific logic of vertical and horizontal movement. Once discovered, this can be exploited by the player. For instance, when on a tile surrounded by walls on three sides, the mummy will not leave his position when his logic anticipating the player's movement prevents him from moving into the direction of the exit. Further rules are added through a number of traps, multiple mummies (who get into a fight where one is killed when the explorer lures them towards each other), a key that opens or closes a gate, and the specific position of walls. Although most levels seem to resemble each other, the solution is always different.  The game's main mode is called Adventure. It consists of fifteen pyramids, with fifteen levels each, that need to be unlocked gradually. After finishing a pyramid, a treasure is provided and in the final pyramid the valuable riches of Pharaoh Tutankhamen await the player. The Classic mode has similar gameplay, but there the mazes are randomly generated with an increasing difficulty. The Adventure mode only keeps track of the player's completion time, but in the Classic mode points are awarded based on how quickly the maze is solved. The game also contains a tutorial where the basic game mechanics are explained in three sessions.  After completing a level, progress is saved automatically. During gameplay the player can also undo as many moves as needed or reset the entire maze. An ankh near the left side of the screen turns red when the explorer is moved into a position where he can no longer solve the maze. The explorer is controlled through the cursor keys or the mouse. Sometimes, it is also need to perform a ""wait"" action, where the player skips his turn, used to lure an enemy into a specific position or movement pattern."

When no more moves are possible, some animals disappear at a loss of points until new matches become possible.

Every few boards, there a Stampede Round bonus level where groups of three identical animals need to be clicked quickly to make them disappear and to keep the climbing stack from reaching the top of the screen.  Strategy  This mode is fairly identical to Action with the major difference that matched animals not only disappear, but also cause the animals and other types of blocks on top of it to drop down, reshuffling the level and sometimes even trapping animal blocks. There are also no bonus rounds. Apart from that, the gameplay is the same.  Puzzle  This game mode is completely different and uses the typical Match-3 gameplay from such games as Bejeweled. The board is filled with animals (no other blocks) and each animal's position can be swapped with one next to it. That way, matches of three animals or more, in a horizontal or vertical line, need to be formed. They disappear and new animals appear from the top of the screen, filling the board.

The gameplay remains exactly the same: the player controls a cannon at the top of the screen, that can turn 180º and shoot balls at a series of bricks or pegs that turn brighter when hit. The ball bounces around the screen and eventually falls down, making the touched bricks explode. The player has limited number of balls to clear all the orange pegs. A large bowl keeps moving at the bottom of the screen from one side to the other and, if the ball falls inside, it is saved and added to the remaining ones.  At the moment before the ball hits the last orange peg, the camera zooms in for a slow-motion close-up and Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" starts playing in the soundtrack. After that, the ball falls in one of the five bowls that cover the bottom of the screen, with bonus points ranging between 10,000 to 100,000 points.  In the Adventure Mode, the game is divided in 12 stages, each one with 5 levels and a different character. The character changes the power-up released by hitting the green bricks/pegs. For example, in the levels of the squirrel Jimmy Lighting, the power is multi-ball. In the Claude the lobster levels, it is a pair of claws that act like pinball flippers.  The Challenge Mode has 60 unique levels with specific goals. Five of the Challenge levels are only playable after completing 15 levels in the Adventure mode, while the remaining 55 levels are only accessible after completing it. In Quick Play the player can retry any completed levels, and in the Duel Mode two players can compete in hot-seat."

Pirate ships have the same movement options and an identical speed of one square per turn. It is also possible not to move and fire the two broadside cannons to the left and the right of the ship instead, with a maximum reach of three squares.  Since the player's galleon is always outnumbered, the pirates can be tricked to move inside the line of fire. Black ships also blindly track the player's movement, meaning they can be lured to collide with island reefs or ship wrecks. Red ships are smarter and avoid obvious obstacles by moving around them.

The rest can be unlocked by playing the quest mode. The classic mode works in the same way as in previous games. The player is presented with a grid that is partially filled with coloured blocks. More blocks are added to grid, one row at a time, from the bottom of the grid. The aim of the game is to remove these blocks before they reach the top of the screen.

Talismania Deluxe>Talismania Deluxe>2006>ESRB - E (Everyone)>PopCap Games>RocketJump Games>Puzzle>2.5>1 Player>"Talismania is a puzzle game set on boards with different tiles. There are at least two talismans in the game, as they launch a coloured path. The player needs to rotate the other titles on the board to connect the tubes and extend the path. This is done by clicking them. Once two or more talismans are connected, the tiles are removed, coins are awarded and new tiles are put on the board.  In the game's main Story Mode, players guide King Midas along nine locations where he needs to construct buildings. Based on the mythological premise, he has accidentally turned his daughter to gold and asks Zeus for advice. To break the curse Midas has to make money and spend it on others, by setting up structures. Each location on the level map is divided into different segments where Midas needs to earn coins to pay the workers to build for him. Each level requires a certain number of coins, gathered through successive games. Players can use three types of talismans in the game: owls (bronze), unicorns (silver) or lions (gold). The type is determined by the performance in the previous game. To encourage players to make long-winding connections instead of choosing a direct route, more combos and points make sure that gold talismans (with a higher cash count and thus nicer buildings) are used. If wrong decisions are made, silver or bronze is introduced. Easy levels only have two talismans, but in later ones there are often more than four, and of different types in a single game. Identical talismans can join the ""stream"" for large combos, but different ones block each other.  While progressing, additional difficulties and bonuses are introduced, such as cash tiles, lightning tiles (create more coins), stone tiles (block a path), medusa tiles (she turns tiles into stones), minotaur tiles (creates worthless tiles by charging across the board), pandora's blocks (can provide a positive or a negative effect), freeze blocks (freeze the bonus chest until the path is complete), sirens (drain the talisman meter), and many more. The special ones can be activated or destroyed by connecting the ""stream"" to all sides of them. Negative ones that are ignored and kept on the board, will quickly start doing damage.  There is also a bonus chest with a number that counts down. If the player manages to finish a level with a number of plays lower than the number, a jackpot is unlocked. Other special actions are rewarded with stars, stored at the bottom of the screen. When three or more are available, Talismania can be started where the player can click as many tiles as possible on the board to turn them into gold right away. This only lasts a few seconds. After every few rounds, a quick mini-game can be played to earn an additional building. Players need to click flying items and watch out no harpies are touched.  After a number of levels, the Hero Mode is unlocked. It is very similar, but introduces a time limit. Players can also earn extra points by finishing early. Both modes have a separate high scores list."

On regular mode, each click makes one tile fall to the top of the column and another one float up to the bottom.

In the speed mode, the floating tiles are added automatically every few seconds.  Special tiles appear randomly on the gamefield. The magnet pulls a column upwards to the next row. The anvil is the opposite, pushing the column downwards one row. The joker face becomes a copy of the same type when touching other tile. The color bomb removes all tiles of the same type it lands on. The dynamite stack explodes one whole column.  There is a bonus puzzle game between levels, where the objective is to clear the screen before time runs out.

As the player divides the playfield, the smaller section will be blanked out killing any enemies trapped within and walking along the border. When the playfield is reduced to 15% of its original size, the level is cleared and the player can move on to the next. There are two different kinds of enemies: ones walking around the border of the playfield and ones swimming around inside the playfield. The enemies display different movements. While most walk in their own random patterns, some will actually follow the player's launcher. Some border walking enemies will even attack the player's dividing lines in order to stop the division from happening. There are 9 stages which are essentially just backgrounds, with 599 playable levels in total.
Wizard's Pen, The>Wizard's Pen, The>2008>ESRB - E (Everyone)>PopCap Games>PopCap Games>Puzzle>3.3>1 Player>The Wizard's Pen is a word guessing game, where the player must write the name of objects by analysing portions of their pictures. Each stage is a collection of 16 pictures and objects sharing the same theme.  The main interface shows a blank page from a magic book, where clicking anywhere on it uncovers a small square of a complete object picture. The player must guess the object and type its name in a tab at the bottom of the screen. The game accepts the most common synonyms and variants for the names, and has tolerance for small typing errors.  A candle at the left side diminishes with every opened square, allowing 8 clicks per page. A number of stars are received for each correct answer, with less clicks awarding more stars. When the candle is a small stub, clicking on the wick smoke reveals the object, but the player doesn't receive any stars.  In some pages the image is not hidden, but distorted beyond recognition. Instead of uncovering it bit by bit, each click on the messed picture clears it slowly, and at any time the player can guess the object by typing its name.  An incomplete picture appears between stages, with missing bits listed at the right side of the screen. The player must click on the places indicated by the list, where the magical pen will draw the missing parts.  At the start of each stage, three magical potions can be taken from a selection of nine. They sit on a shelf at the right side of the page, and can be used at any moment. The perception potion increases the size of the uncovered square. The freeze potion stops the candle from decreasing in size for a few turns. The anagram potion shows a word made with the same letters of the object name. The drippy ink makes the square reveal a bit more of the picture, by making it drip down the page. The hint potion shows a clue about the object. The crystal ball shows three successive objects melded together. The clean slate resets the candle state, erasing all the revealed parts of the picture. The swirl potion paints a spiral on the page, revealing parts of the picture. The silhouette shows the object contour for a few seconds. The lightning shows the complete picture for a brief moment.  The stars collected in every stage are used to open sketchbooks with extra levels, that can be accessed at the main menu.

Zuma Deluxe>Zuma Deluxe>2003>ESRB - E (Everyone)>PopCap Games>PopCap Games>Puzzle>3.9>1 Player>"Zuma Deluxe  is an Aztec-themed action puzzler. The goal: eliminate all the balls before they reach the skull. Balls roll down a track towards this skull and the player-controlled frog-shaped idol must shoot balls toward them to stop them, earning points. Using the mouse to rotate the frog and clicking to fire, the player needs to create rows of three or more of the same color balls to eliminate them.  The catch is that each track is shaped differently. Part of the track may block others so that if the track is filled with balls, the ones behind some may be unreachable. Fortunately, the player has up to four lives, a rarity in many puzzle games.  The game offers two different play modes: •Adventure Mode  The player must battle through multiple temples to find the secrets of the Zuma. In this ""campaign mode"", temples that have been defeated may be skipped by the player when the player continues the game via save game.   **Gauntlet Mode  The player must work the player's level up from Rabbit to Sun God. Levels used in this mode must first be unlocked from the Adventure Mode. Gauntlet Mode also offers 4 (four) additional play modes: Random, Spesific, Practice, and Survival. "
Zuma's Revenge>Zuma's Revenge>2009>ESRB - E (Everyone)>PopCap Games>PopCap Games>Puzzle>4.1>1 Player>Zuma's Revenge is the sequel to Zuma Deluxe. As in the previous game, the main goal is to clear a series of marble strings by matching three or more balls of the same color. The spheres roll on twisting tracks that occupy most of the screen, appearing from one side and moving towards the gaping mouth of a golden skull. The player controls a frog that is either stationed near the tracks or moving sideways at the bottom. The amphibian holds one of the colored balls in its open mouth, and a reserve one inside its body.  The main Adventure Mode is divided in sequential zones, each with several levels. The main objective of each level is to aim and shoot at the moving lines to make three-of-a-kind color matches and fill a meter at the top to finish. If three or more balls enter the exit hole, the player loses one life and the level has to be replayed. When all lives are spent, the whole zone has to be restarted from the latest automatic checkpoint, usually at mid-point.  Some of the spheres are marked with icons and have power-ups that can be activated with matches. The bomb explodes all the surrounding spheres, the reticule improves shot accuracy by giving temporary laser targeting sights to the frog, the rewind arrow pushes all the marbles backwards, the hand slowdowns movement for some seconds, the lightning bolt vaporizes all the balls of one color, the tri-shot fires three cannon balls that destroy anything in their path and the laser surgically removes single spheres. Some levels have pairs of lily pads, and the frog can jump between them to eliminate all the marbles.  A boss battle happens at the end of each zone, where the opponent is an idol mask that keeps moving sideways at the top. The frog moves at the bottom and has to hit the enemy with several spheres to defeat it, while at the same time matching the moving line of spheres to clear the field. Each boss has a different attack and defense strategy, throwing enchantment shots at the frog and putting obstacles and minions to block the area.  Besides Adventure Mode, there are three additional modes that are gradually unlocked as the levels are completed in the main game. In Challenge Mode, the objective is to achieve a high score under three minutes. The top meter is replaced by a bonus gauge that slowly fills with every match. When it is full, it transforms one of the spheres into a multiplier that gives bonus points after being matched. The Heroic Frog Mode is a harder version of Adventure Mode, with the spheres moving faster and with more color variations from the start. Iron Frog Mode is unlocked after finishing Adventure Mode, and is the hardest mode where the player has only one life available to complete ten difficult levels in sequence.
