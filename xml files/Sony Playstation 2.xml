    <story>007- Agent Under Fire is the first James Bond game to appear on the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox. The game casts the player as the legendary James Bond who must accomplish missions throughout different areas of the world. Bond is sent on a mission rescue Zoe Nightshade, a CIA agent in the hands of Nigel Bloch. Nigel Bloch is the CEO of Identicon, a section of a highly successful industry company known as Malprave industries. Bond is also tasked to retrieve the set of DNA samples that are in Identicon&apos;s hands. So James Bond sets off on another adventure... The game combines three game modes into one package- first-person-shooter, which is what most of the missions are, a rail-shooter, where the player only controls firing, and a driving game, where the player drives one of the many Bond cars. Numerous weapons have been added to the series, along with some fictional weapons like the Photon cannon and the 5-way grenade launcher. The player can utilize a wide array of gadgets and weapons, like the Q-Claw, Q-Decoder, and Bond&apos;s trusty Walther handgun. There is a large variety of missions, and Bond can go through most missions with weapons, or take a stealthy approach. The player is also rated in each level, based on score and difficulty level, and can unlock new features for both single and multiplayer.</story>

    <story>A nanobot has been stolen from the work of a world renowned scientist, Dr. Katya Nadanova, of the Oxford Department of Microtechnology by a man known only as the General, and has kidnapped the girl as well. James Bond races to rescue both the scientist and to retake the nanobots, and kills the General along with the nanobot samples. Bond returns Kataya to a nearby base, but it turns out the scientist has not been so faithful to Oxford. Katya meets up with Nikolai Diavolo, and gives him a hidden vial of the nanobots. Before long Bond is yet again called into action when MI6 loses contact with 003. And so Bond is off to Peru... Everything or Nothing is the second of the James Bond third-person shooters, after Tomorrow Never Dies for the Playstation. The game features new guns and a new and improved aiming system which allows you to strategically hug walls and fire around or crouch behind cover. New gadgets allow Bond to go invisible, disrupt electronics, or control mechanical spiders which allow him to access new areas. Everything or Nothing is also the first game where Pierce Brosnan actually supplies his voice for the likeness of his character, as well as many other such as Judi Dench and John Cleese. The game features a a campaign with over 30 missions and a brand new co-op game where you take the roles of newly recruited MI6 agents on investigations of their own. EON also includes a same-screen deathmatch that allows for up to four players to play.</story>

    <story>Building on 007- Everything or Nothing&apos;s range of strengths, 007- From Russia with Love is based on the 1963 film starring Sean Connery as James Bond. He is sent to Istanbul to acquire the Russian decoder machine known as the Lektor from a (supposedly) defecting Russian agent by the name of Tatiana Romanova. However, the Russians have no knowledge of this plan because it is a trap for James Bond created by the criminal organization known as Octopus. It is up to James Bond to seize the device and confront the dangerous assassin Red Grant and the ruthless Rosa Klebb. In most of the 18 missions the player progresses through linear levels while shooting everything in sight. The player can lock onto an enemy at range and cycle between visible enemies, or focus in closer on a single enemy to make opportunistic targets appear, such as uncovered grenades or gaps in armor. Sometimes Bond can also use stealth or hand-to-hand combat, which are basically quick-time events where the player needs to press a displayed button in a limited time to dispatch a foe. Special tasks can be preformed with gadgets, e.g. the laser watch or a small remote controlled helicopter. This procedure gets spiced up with occasional driving or new jet pack sequences. The player gets rewarded for certain actions with bonus points, e.g. succeeding in melee combat or searching containers. There are three different kind of points which unlock different things- bonus content like making of videos, bonus levels, and weapon upgrades. Every weapon and gadget can be upgraded in different areas, but only once.</story>

    <story>Based on the scripts of the 21st movie Casino Royale and the 22nd James Bond movie of the same name as the game, it follows closely the story of those movies but elaborates many scenes and fills in some blanks. In a first person shooter fashion, the player directs Bond through the levels filled with many bad guys. To overcome those, Bond has several different kinds of weapons at his disposal ranging from his trusted P99, over machine guns to full blown grenade launchers. But the levels are also filled with canisters that either explode upon shooting or vent gas that temporarily blinds the enemy. Bond can also perform a take down move which puts an enemy out silently. If Bond is near enough to an enemy, a button press will initiate the corresponding mini-game in which the player needs to hit a circle with a crosshair in a short period of time. Is the player successful, the enemy is out of the play but when he fails to hit the mark in time, Bond will be thrown away from the enemy and is vulnerable for a short period of time. In addition Bond can duck into cover to avoid bullets and shoot blindly over it or look out of it to get the kill. Bond also automatically regenerates his health when not under fire. Other obstacles in the levels are cameras, which can either be shot or disabled and electronic locks which need to be hacked in another mini-game. There arrows flash green or red on the screen and the player needs to press the corresponding button fast enough when it blink green to input the right number into the keypad. The game also features a multiplayer mode for up to 12 players with the following game modes- 1. Bond Versus- one player takes over the control of James Bond and either needs to defuse two of the three bombs in the level or kill all six of the opposing team. In this mode Bond can also see all enemies and has two lives. 2. Golden Gun- the first player to score 100 points wins the round. Points are earned by kills but if the player is holding the always visible power weapon called Golden Gun, he scores 6 points per kill. 3. Bond Evasion- in this mode one member of the MI6-team randomly gets to be Bond and needs to get to the escape point of the map to win the round for his team. Meanwhile The Organization tries to stop him by either killing him or preventing him to reach the escape points in time.</story>

    <story>Crow is a hitman who lives in Ireland. His mother was a fortune teller who possessed mysterious powers and was killed when Crow was very young. The boy was adopted by a mob boss known as Papa Tonia. Crow inherited from his mother a unique ability to slow down time, which he trained to become a feared assassin. However, his main goal in life is to find who killed his mother, and exact his revenge. 10.000 Bullets is a 3D third-person shooter. The player controls Crow as well as three other characters during the course of the game. The slowdown ability is similar to the bullet time effect used in Max Payne, but can be eventually upgraded so that the player character himself can move at normal speed while everything around him freezes. Killing several enemies in close succession awards the player bonus points, which can be used between levels to upgrade the protagonist&apos;s health as well as teach him special offensive and evasive manoeuvres. There are also short adventure-like sequences requiring the player to talk to characters to advance the plot.</story>

There are also deathmatch modes where the goal is to get the maximum of frags on other cars in arena style maps.</story>

This game is very similar to it&apos;s predecessor, but now it appears on newer platforms, and has more trucks, and many more tracks. The trucks in this game are licensed likenesses of trucks you may see driving down the streets of suburban America. You can purchase a truck in career mode, and then trick it out with custom parts to turn it into an off-road monster. The career mode from 4x4 Evo is again the main focus of 4x4 Evo 2. This time, crazy missions provide for an alternative to the races found in the rest of the game. For example, you may find yourself using your truck to track down lost gold, or locate misplaced outhouses. The GameCube version features four exclusive tracks and four exclusive trucks.</story>

    <story>This game lets you step into the footsteps of 50 Cent himself. As he tries to free the kidnapped K-Dog with his crew in the streets of New York City, 50 gets shot nine times (just like his real-life counterpart) and left for dead. After getting stitched up, he sets out to find those who tried to kill him and uncovers a bigger conspiracy. The game is a 3rd-person shooter with all the typical features- You have a wide array of weapons (including akimbo shooting), there are over 25 moves to finish people off at close range, you can find money to buy health packs, armor, and other helpful items. You can grab enemies and use them as human shields and use mobile objects (like dumpsters on wheels) as cover. The game uses the havok physics engine for a more dynamic environment. In many missions, you&apos;ll be rolling with your crew, the G-Unit- Lloyd Banks (as a locksmith), Young Buck (weapons expert), and Tony Yayo (the demolition man). They will provide back-up and perform tasks that are necessary to complete objectives. The game comes with lots of additional material too (some of it unlockable), like music videos and 4 CDs worth of music with lots of previously unreleased material. Guest starring are Dr. Dre as Grizz and Eminem as Detective McVicar.</story>

    <story>Fifteen years ago, the The Belkan Federation began a war of conquest, invading nearby territories. To stop them, a military alliance was set up between the Osean Federation and the Union of Yuktobanian Republics. These two great powers drove the Belkans back but their counter-invasion was cut short when the Belkans detonated 6 nuclear warheads on their own soil, preventing the alliance from advancing on them. This ended the great war and a time of peace has reigned. The Osean and Yuktobanian nations have remained allies. On the small remote, Sand Island, off the western coast of Osea, a skilled veteran of the war named Captain Bartlett (callsign- Heartbreaker) trains new pilots as the 108th Tactical Fighter Squadron, designated Wardog in the Osean Air Defense Force (OADF). During a routine training operation, unidentified aircraft appear on the radar and proceed to shoot down many of the squadron&apos;s not fully trained pilots. The squadron is left with few survivors, and the incident covered up while the military tries to figure out what&apos;s going on. Soon after, the nation of Yuktobania declares war on Osea, thus beginning a new conflict. Ace Combat 5- The Unsung War is a first person air combat and flight simulator. Like other Ace Combat games, each mission is determined by a level briefing and objectives. There are 32 missions in the main campaign mode, while an additional arcade mode puts the player in the role of Mobius One (from Ace Combat 04- Shattered Skies) as he faces endless waves of enemy attacks. Regardless of the mode chosen, once in the air the player will have control over speed, direction, altitude, gun cannon, missiles and special weapon of their aircraft. A new feature from previous Ace Combat games, is the concept of Wingmen and being able to issue simple orders to them in the air. This allows the player to better coordinated group attacks as well as giving each wingman a personality of their own. Additionally, the player as squadron leader will be asked to make decisions (Yes/No) while flying in the air. Between missions, the story is progressed through a series of cutscenes. Successful destruction of enemy targets earns the player money, which can be used to purchase new aircraft. Unlike Ace Combat 04- Shattered Skies special weapons no longer need to be purchased, however airplanes in the inventory apply to the entire squadron so if the player wishes a full wing of F-16s, they must have enough for everyone to fly. Ace Combat 5, though situated in a fictional world highlights real-world models of aircraft including the F-14 Tomcat, Su-27 Flanker, F-16, A-6 Intruder, A-10 Thunderbolt, F-15, F/A-18, Tornado, and many more.</story>

    <story>This sixth installment in the Ace Combat series is a prequel to Ace Combat 5 that tells about the Belkan War eluded to in Unsung War. The story is told through the eyes of a reporter, 15 years after the altercation, uncovering secrets about the Belkan War of how it led to war, the outcome of the nuclear detonations within their borders and a near disastrous secret that nearly led to the destruction of a nation. The main game mode is the story mode, in which the player takes control of an Ustio mercenary pilot, call-sign Demon Lord, taking part of the said war, advancing missions and advancing in the story while doing it. The missions can be anything done airborne, and there&apos;ll be escort, assault and defence missions amongst others. Like in the previous games, the game isn&apos;t about simulation, but fast paced aerial combat in highly powered aircraft. More like Top Gun, and less like real world. There are 30 licensed fighter jets to choose from, and as a new gimmick, there is Ace Style -meter which determines the story as the player see&apos;s fit. The player can choose to only take out intended targets and be considered a knight, take out military targets and minimal civilian causalities for a soldier ranking or be considered a mercenary where the player can take out damaged aircraft and mass destruction of civilian causalities. As the player plays the game over, the game will adjust to their style, depending on their style the game can send out new and more dangerous squadrons to try and stop the player at any cost.</story>

    <story>Action Girlz Racing is a kart racing game with a cast of eight girls racing in miniature cars. The gameplay is very similar to the contemporary Myth Makers- Super Kart GP by the same developer. The three game modes are single trial, time trial and grand prix. There are three difficulty levels (beginner, experienced and advanced) and three racing classes (50 cc, 100 cc and 150 cc). The game includes environments such as a fairytale castle, sunset lagoon, action girlz high, dolphin bay resort and aquacoral resort. As with many of the developer&apos;s games most of the content is locked from the start. Most characters, tracks and race classes become available after collecting a number of flowers during races as a currency. The different characters only differ in appearance, not in abilities. While racing it is possible to bump into other racers and the tracks contain many obstacles that slow down the racers or can be knocked around. Eight types of power-ups can be picked up such as nitro, an umbrella shield, shooting opponents or stunning them. Power-ups can be doubled or maxed out by collecting diamonds. Tracks often have branching paths, but instead of offering alternative routes or short-cuts, they often lead to dead ends, forcing the racer to backtrack. The Wii version supports local split-screen multiplayer games for up to four players. The karts are controlled through motion by holding the Wii Remote horizontally and then tilting left or right. The PS2 version supports split-screen games for two players and up to four players through Multi-Tap.</story>

Fearing this, the duo sets out to make sure that it doesn&apos;t come true. The Adventures of Cookie &amp; Cream is designed for cooperative gameplay with two players. The goal of each level is to get to the end in a limited amount of time. There is basically a straight road from A to B where the players have to overcome obstacles in their way. This includes standard platforming or puzzles which need both players to solve, e.g. one has to press a button so that the other can progress. Because the way is not the same for both characters the game uses a split-screen view. Power-ups increase the time limits but certain obstacles decrease it again if touched. There are overall 35 levels. It is possible to play the game alone but then the player has to control both characters at once. The game also features a unique 4-player mode where each character is controlled by two people and one joypad.</story>

Aeon has a health meter and a style meter; when the health meter is depleted, the game is over. The style meter is filled by attacking or killing enemies; when you have earned enough style, you can charge up your combo attacks for extra damage. Aeon is also equipped with a gun called the FUG (Flux Universal Gun) as well as various gadgets. To use the gun you will need ammo which can be picked up at various locations on each level. The various gadgets and gizmos available need to be used to get past certain areas and solve some puzzles; intel capsules provide you with important data, small orbs can be controlled to disable alarms and activate doors, Aeon can hide in rollers to navigate through areas undetected, and more.</story>

    <story>In this tennis game with the endorsement of former world no. 1 Andre Agassi, the player has 32 players (all male, of which Agassi is the only real player), every one with their own strengths and 16 tournaments around the world, each with their trademark court (so you can count on Carpet in St. Petersburg, Grass on London, Clay in Paris and Cement on New York). Three game modes are available- Quick game (a simple game where the players sets all options, from location to the participants), Arcade (beating a series of games in a row) and Agassi Tournament, where the player competes for the No. 1 spot. Gameplay is simple, as usual in most tennis matches. There are four buttons, controlling a simple shot, lob, top and back spin, and to win points, the player must be positioned correctly and add the right amount of direction and strength into the shot (by moving the d-pad). Serving uses a power bar where the player presses a key to toss the ball, and the bar fills up as the best time to hit the ball approaches, when the player hits the button again. Like in Virtua Tennis there are two views, the usual TV camera and a behind the player camera. Unlike other games published by Cryo in the Roland Garros series, the camera does not change so that the player is always on the bottom court.</story>

    <story>Hugo, the TV troll from the Danish television series, is on his way to start his first day at the espionage agency R.I.S.K. (Risky Intelligent Spy Knights) when he is attacked by members of the sinister organization SUSPECTRA. Their plans are threatening the entire city, but Agent Hugo soon discovers there is even more at stake. The game is played as a platformer with racing elements. Agent Hugo can use the R.I.S.K. Aquapolis boat with heat-seeking missiles and nitro acceleration. It can also dive and regular weapons can be used. While avoiding mines, the vessels can launch boomballs to blow up energy facilities, knock out enemies and open gates. Hugo can also swim and board other types of boats. On land, he has to either attack or sneak past enemies, with several disguises to stay undetected. When discovered, a meter starts to fill up. It can only be depleted by shaking off enemies and finding a hiding spot. During his mission Agent Hugo meets members of R.I.S.K, such as Agent 01 &amp; 02, professor W, Ms Alltobright and Honeybunny. Villains include SUSPECTRA chief Dr Nogo and the local bosses of the districts- Kizzi Mi, Oddjaw and Max Schmertz.</story>

Progress through the career mode, where you must complete objectives (such as grind a certain object(s) to jump over large gaps and gain points) to open up further arenas, which there are 7 in all, and once your bored with them, you can make your own in the park editor. The game doesn&apos;t use a hard time limit but the so-called juice meter- it fills up when performing stunts and if it gets empty, the level ends. During the game you level up your character in seven stats, e.g. speed and grinds. The game uses a learning by doing approach to this, meaning that the stat improves if you perform the associated actions often enough. There are also five hidden keys in each level which open up new areas within the level. 10 pro inline skaters join the fun (Shane Yost, Sam Fogarty, Sven Boekhorst, Eito Yasuko and more), and you can take on a friend in 2 player split screen.</story>

There are three helicopters to fly in this game, the MBB/Kawasaki BK-117-B, the Boeing CH-47J Chinook , and the Hughes/Kawasaki OH-6D. The game consists of eight timed missions each of which has three levels of difficulty, plus in the training section there&apos;s also a &apos;Free Flight&apos; mode. The first missions are flown in the small OH-6D, missions two and above together with the other craft being locked off until the preceding missions have been completed successfully. Missions are scored on a points system, victims must be rescued while in good health so points are lost if they are not picked up in good time and, of course, points are deducted should the helicopter hit a building or should a victim die. The training section is in the form of a manual and it not only explains the game&apos;s controls but also the workings of the helicopter and includes sections of video footage.</story>

The focus of the game is the story mode during which the player visits four stages (Neo-Tokyo, Laboratory, A-Room and Olympic Stadium) which are also divided into different tables. On each table, the player has to reach special objectives with the usual pinball mechanics, e.g. hitting certain things in the correct order. There are also optional secret rooms to find. After finishing all objectives, the next table is unlocked as well as a cutscene directly taken from the movie. The arcade mode is unlocked after finishing the story and allows the player to freely play the tables for highscores. The vs. mode (either against the AI or another human) is played on two tables which are divided in the middle, but are interconnected through a loop at the top. The main goal is to send as many balls as possible to the opponent&apos;s side because each lost ball gives a penalty point. The first player to reach a certain number loses the match.</story>

    <story>In this tactical football management game, you become the manager of a team in the English, French or Belgian league, with different subdivisions, starting in 2001. Your job includes setting out strategies, planning training sessions, keeping an eye on your players and attracting new talent, taking care of finances, and of course making sure that you win your matches. You will be given specific goals, such as qualifying for the champion&apos;s league, or defending the club&apos;s reputation. Games do not only include league matches, but friendlies and cup matches as well. The actual games can be watched real-time in 3D, allowing for on-the-fly substitutions and tactical decisions, and a unique feature is you can both manage and play for a club, although there is no way to actually control players or actively participate. All players have different abilities and characteristics, which can be trained to create a well-balanced team. The French version portrays manager Guy Roux (famous of Auxerre), while the UK version has Alex Ferguson (Manchester United).</story>

There are several real tracks such as Hockenheim and Laguna Seca, as well as the chance to race in scenic Italian locations such as the Tuscanny hills and the Naples coastline. You can play Instant Action mode, in which you unlock these tracks one by one with indestructible cars, and Dynasty Mode, where you aim to build a more realistic career. What sets the game apart from the crowd is its approach to driver abilities in Dynasty Mode. When setting a driver up, his abilities are split into skill areas such as reflexes and pressure-handling, with points assigned to these. Further skills such as Heart, Intimidation and Recovery can be developed to improve either car or driver. AI cars have the same features applied to them race by race. The driver&apos;s heartbeat is a featured sound effect, and in pressure situations it can be heard above all other sounds. One available skill is the Tiger Effect, which allows you to rewind the game to avoid dangerous situations as they are about to happen. Its length and efficiency are 2 of the skills which can be improved.</story>

    <story>You&apos;re a little yellow alien. The FBI has shot down your ship while flying over planet Earth. And it, quite literally, lands right on their doorstep. After a series of FBI Agents swipe your ship, what option do you have other than to blow up everything in your path to get it back? Alien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them. The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin. Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible. Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill. To help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection. Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies. You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them. The GBA version of the game is identical in gameplay, however, with a few bosses removed (such as the robot bee and the FBI big-fisted tank robot). The PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 versions of the game include a special PDA Game with very simple-looking graphics. Your goal in this game is to kill all the agents by hopping on their heads, and then reach the exit. Included with this game is a level editor, allowing you to make your own levels and then send them to friends if you have the Xbox or Xbox 360 version.</story>

Moving away from the FPS series on PC, Extinction has you controlling one of the three races in a real time strategy mix, building each unit and setting them out into the battlefield to complete a range of tasks. Each race has an advantage and disadvantage. The humans have a collection of different units, from heavy weapons experts to medics, and are better known for their long range attacks. Predators are hardcore fighters, taking the battle right up to the enemy, although there are fewer of them available to counter act their superior power. Finally, the Aliens are fast and deadly, and always hunt in large packs. Upgrade weapons and use terrain to an advantage in each level to make certain your team (whoever or whatever they may be) survive until the next battle.</story>

    <story>The PS2 and Wii versions of Alone in the Dark follow the same plot as the game developed for Xbox 360 and Windows by Eden Games, but were created by a different company with their own vision how the game should be implemented. Level structure, mechanics of gameplay, and looks of the characters (Sarah, especially) sometimes differ strongly as these versions contain concept elements that were left out of the other game. The driving sequences are almost entirely taken out. The first-person view is also mostly not used, and, for example, fire can be extinguished in the third-person mode. The basic aspects of screenplay are retained, but this can be considered another what if instalment in the series, rather than a canonical entry like the other version. The endings have a different look, but remain largely the same.</story>

    <story>Alpine Racer 3 is a downhill ski racing game. It is based on the arcade Alpine Racer series played on a cabinet where the player stands on a set of ski-like foot stands that are moved with horizontal motions to steer and taking corners while holding onto two bars for stability. This is the first game in the series made for a console system. The features and game modes are most likely not identical to the Alpine Racer 3 arcade game. A first for the series, it mixed skiing with snowboarding previously featured in the arcade game Alpine Surfer. The main game mode is the Extreme Winners Cup that features cross races, slalom, one-on-one and time attack. These largely serve to qualify for the tournaments. There are eight characters to choose from (one initially locked) and several courses. Each character has different statistics based on speed, turning and power. By winning races credits are earned to upgrade the snowboard and ski gear. Next to steering an additional button can be used to crouch and gain extra speed, but this limits movement. The same button is used in the air to perform tricks. The game can be played competitively against another player through a split-screen. Some of the equipment in the game comes from licensed manufacturers.</story>

In the Competition, you are competing against others as you work to win the competition. Once the list of competitors is narrowed down to the top 10, you will be able to see your opponents and watch replays of their performances. After each performance, the three judges will comment on your performance. To play, you must try to press the given key(s) at the right time. There are five levels you can get at each place you need to press the key(s). If you hit it right on, you get the highest ranking and have a chance to get a style bonus if you can do that 5 times in a row. If you hit it and are off by a little, you will get one of the other rankings, or the lowest ranking if you miss or press the wrong key. Sometimes you will also have to hold a press for a length of time and let up at the right moment. The game offers many songs, but only 2 voices for each song. If you are male, you get the male voice; if you are female, you get the female voice. The lyrics will appear as the song is sung, so if you want to learn the song as well as compete, you can.</story>

    <story>Hollywood is in an uproar - the Edgar awards for films have been stolen! The culprit is none other than C.C. Deville, who is threatening to melt down the Edgars unless he gets a ten-picture deal from Warner Bros.! Deville arrives in his airship, but accidentally crashes into the Water Tower, scattering the Edgars across the various movie lot and freeing Yakko, Wakko, and Dot at the same time. Help the Warners reclaim the Edgars! Animaniacs- The Great Edgar Hunt is a 3D platformer where the player controls Yakko, Wakko, and Dot. Each character has their own special skills that can be unlocked as players progress through the game. For example, Dot can limbo under low walls, Wakko can dig tunnels in soft earth, and Yakko can bomb weak walls. Players progress further through the game by collecting Edgar awards which open up more areas in the Warner Movie Lots. There are also 300 collectibles in each world; players are awarded one Edgar at 150 collectibles and another at 300. In addition to this, there are also bonus mini-games guest starring Pinky and The Brain. Each of their short games features another failed attempt at world domination. The game also has the original cast of the cartoon reprising their roles for the game. There are also plenty of movie parodies, and it also takes the opportunity to riff a couple of video games as well.</story>

Frylock had been admitted into the prestigious and exclusive Jersey Pines golf course... while Shake was rejected (he didn&apos;t actually apply, but that doesn&apos;t stop him from complaining about it). So, Shake decides to challenge Frylock in a game of golf just to prove that he&apos;s just as worthy as Frylock to be playing on that golf course. Who cares that Shake has no clue how to play golf? He&apos;s angry. The game plays like a mix between a quite simplified golf simulator, an action game and has golf cart racing elements thrown in for good measure. The game features lots of extras as well, such as 4 full episodes of the show (one of which is unaired), artwork and movie clips.</story>

    <story>The story of Ar tonelico- Melody of Elemia takes place in the world of Sol Ciel, a world consisting of two floating islands connected by the Tower of Ar tonelico. Long ago people had built up a great civilization under the guidance of the goddesses the Trio of Elemia, but over the years things have changed; there were two disasters that have lead towards the destruction of the world. In the first disaster most of the lands and skies were lost, in the second the super civilization was lost; now in the third era another disaster is beginning. Viruses born in the Altar of Apostles have begun to appear, though normally not in physical form have now taken on the form of monsters and could destroy the world. In the upper levels of the Tower is a city called Platina where the Knights of Elemia reside; their job is to control virus outbreaks to preserve the tower. One such knight is Lyner Barsett; the main character of the story, he will need to go on a quest to find the Hymn Crystal which can save the Tower of Ar tonelico and the whole world. Ar tonelico- Melody of Elemia is an RPG style game where you control Lyner Barsett. As the game begins, your airship crashes in the lower world; you&apos;ll not only need to locate the Hymn Crystal somewhere in the lower world, but then figure out how to return to the upper levels of the tower! Gameplay features both an exploration mode and battle mode. When exploring you can wander around the many locations of Sol Ciel; you&apos;ll encounter numerous people to talk to, various towns and cities, as well as locate useful items. In many areas battles are randomly encountered; on the screen is a colored meter - beginning green, it slowly fades towards red. The closer to red the meter becomes, the greater your chances of randomly encountering a battle. Battles in the game are turn based; Lyner as well as other characters in your party each have the ability to perform attacks as well as utilize various skills. Throughout the game you will encounter several characters known as Reyvateils; Reyvateils have the unique ability to sing songs which can be crafted into powerful magic for attacking, healing, or defense. When a Reyvateil is in your party, she remains at the back during battles; you can give her commands on what songs to sing - the longer she sings, the more powerful the magic will become. However singing tires a Reyvateil, and if she sings for too long she becomes so tired the built up magic is lost so you need to make sure to give a command to activate the magic before that happens. Normally opponents don&apos;t attack a Reyvateil, only the characters on the front line. Occasionally though an enemy will target a Reyvateil; when this happens you need to make sure other characters protect her, for though Reyvateils can craft powerful magic they are mostly defenseless to enemy attacks! When all opponents in the battle have been defeated, the battle is won and points are earned which can level up your characters. Throughout the game you will need to help Reyvateils learn more powerful song magic. To do this you will need to dive into a Reyvateils cosmosphere. The cosmosphere is the world of her mind consisting of her private thoughts and emotions; when there you can interact with the Reyvateil and help her overcome obstacles to learn new songs. However since you are viewing her private thoughts, you first need to gain the trust of the Reyvateil. This is done by interacting in the real world first by talking; talk topics can be found in various locations throughout the world and also after various events. When you have enough talk topics completed you can then dive to the next level in the Reyvateils mind. Another important skill Lyner learns early on is Grathmelding; this allows you to combine various items to form new ones. To do so, you will first need to locate a recipe so you know what to combine as well as Grathnode crystal to aid the process. The required items can sometimes be bought in shops or may be found by exploring the world. The items you create may be necessary to get past certain obstacles, or can just help you out in battle.</story>

    <story>In the world of Ar Ciel, the Reyvateil region is being threatened by an epidemic that&apos;s been killing the citizens. A knight from the Grand Bell, Croix, is sent there to deal with the epidemic. The people of Metafalss, lead by the Grand Bell, rebel against the Goddess who controls the world, in order to achieve their dream and create a utopia by singing a Song in the Hymnos language, called Metafalica - as the legend says. Melody of Metafalica is an RPG, much like its predecessor, Melody of Elemia, that takes place one and a half years later. It is the second installment in the Ar tonelico series. The turn-based battle sequences from the random enemy encounters are split up into two phases. In the first one, Attack, the different characters can perform various attacks until a time gauge runs out. When there is a Reyvateil in the party, a member of the race who can wield magic by transforming sounds into energy, players can determine which magic to use and the moment to unleash it. In the second phase, Defend, enemies have the opportunity to attack and will target the (up to two) Reyvateil who are singing at the back of the party. The other characters must then defend by timing the defensive moves. The effectiveness of attacks is also often determined by how well the attacks are synced to the requests of the Reyvateil. The game is largely centered around female heroines and it contains a dive system where Croix can dive into the mind (Cosmospheres) of certain Reyvateils to get to know their feelings and emotions. That game element plays out with text-heavy dating-style elements where the choices can alter the storyline and it is also the system through which new Song Magic is crafted. Diving can only be done to the three main characters in the game and Croix needs to commit to one, it is not possible to hop between them. New evil Reyvateil can be converted by using the Dive system and afterwards they will contribute to the party. These are equipped through an additional item slot that affects a character through offensive or defensive means.</story>

You view the action from overhead, with a camera zooming in and out depending on the intensity of the action and occasionally switching to other angles for dramatic effect. You attack enemies in real time, tapping X once for a simple attack and repeatedly for a combo. You can also guard against attack, dash at an enemy, and press a button to run about the play field faster. The game places heavy emphasis on magic use, with the magic meter recovering automatically and quickly following each spell.</story>

    <story>Arctic Thunder, the fourth installment in Midway&apos;s arcade racing series, is a fantasy snowmobile-racing game that plays like a mix of Cruis&apos;n and a kart racer on ice. The main object of the PS2 and Xbox versions is to upgrade sleds and unlock secret characters or tracks. You earn Gold Medals or lots of points to unlock most secrets, and you do this by winning races. The gameplay involves shooting down enemies with weapons, boosting yourself ahead, and pulling off tricks. Exclusive to the console versions is a Battle Mode that emphasizes the game&apos;s frantic combat.</story>

    <story>Area 51, the urban legend, is a U.S. military-controlled base in the Nevada desert, apparently containing a secret aircraft testing facility. It is also famed as the subject of many UFO conspiracy theories. Area 51, the game, is a FPS set in this particular base, now infested with rampant aliens and a mutagenic virus that changes your character. As Ethan Cole, Special Forces, specialist of HAZMAT (hazardous materials) Division, you will have to discover what&apos;s going on inside the base and blast the menace to save the world. As a First-Person Shooter, the hero will have access to more than 10 types of human and alien weapons to fight the creatures, designed by Stan Winston Studios, monster creator for such films as Aliens, Jurassic Park and Predator. Your character will have to race against time- the same virus that is mutating the facility personnel into monsters is also in your organism, slowly transforming him in a inhuman creature under the control of the alien masterminds.</story>

    <story>Armored Core- Last Raven is a mech combat game, the pilots are called Ravens, and is set about half a year after the events of Armored Core- Nexus. The three major corporations merged into the Alliance in order to rule the world - but a new faction, Vertex, challenges them. Smaller, independent gangs of Ravens called Warlords have grown more aggressive which does not help matters. 24 hours before Vertex plans to unleash full war on the Alliance - which is thought to have devastating consequences for the world - the player enters the scene in the shoes of a new Raven who eventually has to choose a side and play a major role in the conflict... The game has a branching campaign structure and the progression depends on the player&apos;s choices. This leads to different missions to play and concludes in one of six endings. The missions, which are prefaced with voice-over briefings and emails to read, are action-oriented and straightforward; the player usually has to either defeat a number of enemies in the open, visit indoor levels or survive against a single, powerful Raven. The most important part is the mech customization in which the player can tune the performance of the robot and exchange parts. For the first time in the series, the outside parts (e.g. the head or the legs) have locational damage and can be destroyed during missions - for example, when an arm is destroyed the player can&apos;t use the equipped weapon anymore. Between story missions, the player can visit an arena and fight against other Ravens for training. The PSP version has a few additional parts.</story>

    <story>Arthur and the Invisibles- The Game is an action-adventure based on the mostly animated film from director Luc Besson who also wrote the children&apos;s books it originated from. It follows the film&apos;s storyline after the live-action part where a boy must save his grandmother&apos;s house from a greedy developer by finding a treasure that his grandfather went missing in searching for it in the magical land of the tiny Minimoy. When the boy Arthur enters a portal to their land, he shrinks in size and changes his appearance so he becomes like a Minimoy also. Arthur and his two friends, princess Selenia and her brother Bétamèche, try to save the Minimoys from certain destruction. There is a tutorial which teaches you movement and combat plus how to move objects and flip switches. The action begins when a Minimoy ceremony is interrupted by enemy mosquitoes. You have to alternately play as all the three characters and use the special abilities of each to fight, solve puzzles, fly and drive. Arthur can smash spiderwebs and climb, while Selenia can cut through foliage, and Betameche can crawl through small spaces and packs an upgradable projectile-based weapon. Defeating enemies that have special keys is necessary in order to open gates to progress in the game. In one scene, they ride a mosquito through a cavern while shooting other mosquitoes from the air. There are also racing sections. Scenes from the film move the story along from one set piece to another.</story>

    <story>In a future where fossil fuels are limited, major countries and forces of the world are at war with one another over territory. Alliances are made, forming two major sides- The Axis and The Federation. The elite units in these wars are Assault Suits, man-piloted combat mechs called Assault Suits. Jake is one such pilot, drafted into the Pacific States&apos; Marine Corp under the Federation. During his training, the war has grown substantially and upon being assigned to a platoon, he is immediately thrown into combat. Cybernator is a side scrolling mech combat game and platform game. The player controls Jake as he moves his assault suit left and right on the battlefield. The assault suit can jump and use a jetpack for a short time to increase altitude. The assault suit begins with a Shot machine gun weapon that spreads out fire in front, and a Punch weapon for close melee. Additional weapons can be found during the course of the game and existing weapons improved by the gathering of P power-ups left by defeated enemies. Each level contains a variety of enemies and an end boss which must be destroyed to reach the next level. Some levels take place as horizontally scrolling shooters, in which the Assault suit can move up, down, left and right on the screen, but is constantly advancing towards new threats. The PlayStation 2 version is not a straight port or emulation of the original SNES game. It has altered visuals and balance tweaks, as well as a brief new stage at the beginning.</story>

    <story>The long and rich history of the Asterix comics continue with its newest game entry, Asterix and Obelix XXL. The story of the game involves Asterix and Obelix returning to their village in Gaul, after a day of hunting. They come to find that all their fellow village people have been captured. Along with there capture is also the theft of their magic potion, a potion which gives them super human strength. Caesar has captured the gauls and spread them out to the furthest corners of the Roman Empire. Asterix and Obelix must find and free their friends and get the potion before it reaches Caesar. The gameplay consists of the ability to switch between Asterix and Obelix at different times, using each ones skills to your advantage. Through the adventure you will unlock and gain powerful combos and attack moves to help you. This large adventure takes you through six different countries made up of 47 areas, totaling in 40 plus levels. The gameplay is varied from battling hundreds of romans at once to riding/racing sequences and puzzle solving. The graphics have vibrant colors, picturesque backgrounds, exciting special effects and humorous animations. The sound includes zany effects, a range of music from roman to egyptian, and good-humoured voice acting.</story>

    <story>Several druids are kidnapped by the Romans and it seems that Miraculix has something to do with it. Asterix &amp; Obelix travel to Rome only to find out that Caesar has built a huge amusement park called Las Vegum in which he holds the druids captive. Asterix &amp; Obelix need to fight their way through countless Roman soldiers in order to find and free the druids hidden in the different themed areas of the park. On their way they team up or fight against several game-inspired NPCs like Sam Shieffer or Larry Craft. To fight foes the characters have several attack combos and special items like the famous magic potion at their disposal. There are also some puzzles, for which you often need to switch between both characters (which you can do at any time) in order to solve them. Asterix, for instance, cannot move a heavy stone out of the way.</story>

    <story>Lovestorix is in love with Princess Irina but Brutus also wants to marry her. To solve this problem, the Princess decides that she&apos;ll marry whoever wins the Olympic Games. At the same time the evil Doctormabus has discovered a dimensional key with which he can open portals to parallel dimensions and with it threatens to destroy the balance between the worlds. But of course Asterix &amp; Obelix come to the rescue and have to not only stop Doctormabus but also help Lovestorix win the games. Like in Astérix &amp; Obélix XXL 2- Mission- Las Vegum you take control over both Asterix and Obelix and fight your way through hordes of Romans, building up combos with your punches and solving small riddles on the way. You can also change between controling Asterix or Obelix at any time. But since you are taking part in the Olympic Games, there are also several mini-games waiting which need to be beat in order to progress further in the story. These mini-games include things like Long Jump or Tug of War. These field events are played much like in Asterix and Obelix which means for example that you alternate between two buttons as fast as you can to run. Once you&apos;ve completed an event in the story mode, you can also play these events seperately in Olympic Mode in which two players (or one player against the CPU) fight for the gold medal in each discipline. During the story mode you also collect helmets by destroying scenery objects or beating up Romans. These can be used to buy health or new combos ingame or unlock small parts of the movie. You also unlock new characters for the Olympic Mode as you advance in the story. Also the game neither directly follows the storyline of the comic nor the movie, the twist with the portals to the real world is used to also include some actors of the movie in the game.</story>

    <story>In the land of Regallzine, there is a special guild of alchemists - people who possess magic powers they draw creatures called mana. The alchemists are able to manipulate elements and to fuse magical items. One of such alchemists suddenly got the idea of resurrecting an ancient god, claiming it will bring peace and happiness to humanity. To stop the madman, another alchemist, a young man named Klein, enters the scene. Klein is a particularly skillful magic user and has his way with mana, so with the help of his powers he hopes to stop the planned resurrection and to save the world. The gameplay features traditional turn-based battles against randomly encountered enemies and a role-playing system based on the spiritual mana creatures. The characters use mana to create magical items and also equip it to learn special abilities and to gain bonuses when leveling up. Some mana creatures must be given gifts in order to obey you and to become more powerful. Mana-equipping can also grant you physical abilities which you can use to solve puzzles in dungeons.</story>

    <story>The story of Atelier Iris 2- The Azoth of Destiny follows Viese and Felt, two orphans from the land of Eden. At the beginning of the story an earthquake has caused vast portions of the land to disappear! Viese and Felt have volunteered to find out what has happened and to prevent the world of Eden from being destroyed completely. With the aid of a magical sword called the Azure Azoth, Felt sets off through a gate to another world called Belkhyde to search for the answer to their trouble while Viesa remains in Eden to take care of things there. Throughout the game you control Viesa and Felt on their quest. Viesa has just become an alchemist; with the help of the Mana spirits of the world, this gives her the ability to take various items and magically form new items. In order to create a new item, Viesa will need a recipe indicating what ingredients to combine as well as those ingredients. All of these items can be found in various locations throughout the lands, some in Eden and some in Belkhyde. Many of the items Viesa can create with alchemy will be of great help to Felt as he explores Belkhyde and fights in battles; since Felt doesn&apos;t have the ability to create items, they will need the help of a share ring which provides the ability to exchange items even though they are in two different worlds. To progress through the game, Felt will often need to coordinate with Viesa to get useful items for either solving puzzles or making battles easier. As Felt explores Belkhyde, he will meet numerous other characters and will need to undergo various quests in order to save Eden. The battles in the game are turn based; there is a meter at the top of the screen showing each of the characters in the battle with the rightmost character having the next turn. On each turn players may choose one of several attack options. There are two basic types of attacks, break attacks which will send your opponents further left on the meter providing more time or an extra turn, and charge attacks which increase the skill meter. Each character also has special skills which can be used if you have enough points on the skill meter. Battles are encountered randomly; as you wander enemy infested areas, a meter on the screen begins blue in color and slowly fades to red; the closer to red the meter is, the greater your chances of encountering a random battle. As you defeat enemies, this meter will slowly drain; when the meter is empty, you have defeated all of the enemies in that area. As you win battles, experience points are earned allowing your characters to level up and become more powerful. As you progress through the game, the story will unfold. You can learn more about the land and what&apos;s going on by talking to the many people you&apos;ll find as well as through cut scenes at various points.</story>

    <story>The official game of the Games of the XXVIII Olympiad held in Athens in August 2004, Athens 2004 features 25 events spread around 8 sports, the real stadiums and arenas such as the state of the art Olympic Stadium built for the competition and the Panathinaiko, venue of the first modern Olympics, and 64 nations from all around the world. While new developers Eurocom (following two games from ATD) kept most of the gameplay still inspired by the old button-mashers of the early 80s, some events feature interesting twists. While sprinting events don&apos;t need introductions, there are two middle distance events (800m and 1500m) that require the player to control their pace in order to reach the final curve fresh enough to have a second wind and sprint towards the finish. Other innovations are on field events, such as the high jump requiring the player to alternate buttons not as fast as possible, but time them as well as possible to the athlete&apos;s steps as possible, and the discus has the player circling the analogue knobs to build up power, among others. All four swimming events are played in the same fashion as sprinting events, except the athlete must breathe as quickly as possible in intervals, or risks losing precious speed over a section of the race. On gymnastics, floor exercises change according to sex- mens&apos; is mostly based on power, with mashing sequences followed by timed button presses, while womens&apos; require the player to follow on-screen cues (similarly to games such as Dance Dance Revolution), while rings to use both analogues to match the on-screen cues, and the vault has the player mashing the buttons before following an on-screen cue to perform the routine. Some of these events require the player to choose from a predefined routine, which affects the difficulty level and the maximum score awarded by the judges. Making its first appearance in an official videogame, the equestrian individual jump competition requires the player to navigate the horse throughout the track, jumping over obstacles while keeping a steady pace, as the winner is who took the shortest time while collecting less penalties from hitting obstacles. Archery is only slightly modified from previous games in the genre, but skeet now has the player following a predefined path instead of the free aiming gameplay of Sydney 2000. Two game modes are included, the first being arcade (practice, single competitions and a special mode developed with dance mats in minds) and competition, where the player can customize their Olympics in order to play in just one final, compete in the decathlon or heptathlon, all pool or gymnastics events or become one in the Champion mode, featuring all 25 events, the winner being that with the most points.</story>

    <story>You play as the characters Aang, Katara, Haru, and Sokka (all characters from the Nickelodeon cartoon of the same name) in this action adventure title. The game follows the context of the cartoon, in which the world is split up into four nations each dedicated to an element; earth, air, water and fire. Your primary character, Aang, is the newest incarnation of the Avatar, capable of mastering all four elements. The adventure of this game takes place between the first and second seasons on the cartoon, and is a completely separate side-story. As with most games of the action adventure genre, you view the game from a top-down viewpoint and travel around areas fighting monsters and looking for specific items required for quests to progress further through the game. The game unfolds over several chapters, and once you move on from one chapter you cannot backtrack to previous areas. As your characters levels increase with experience, they will gain new bending powers. Also as you progress through the game you will find new armor and equipment for the playable characters to use.</story>

    <story>Backyard Baseball &apos;10 is a baseball game that features all 30 Major League Baseball teams as well as 11 Backyard teams (6 in the DS version). The player can pick a team, players and one of the 12 different fields to play on. The game combines traditional baseball mechanics such as pitching and batting with the ability to use power-ups. Some of the power-ups include- Screaming Liner - The ball is hit so hard it screams Orbiter - The ball cannot be hit any harder; almost a guaranteed home run when hit Popcorn Bunt - Confuse the defense by making a bunch of other balls appear on the field Slime Ball - The ball is covered in goop and no one can catch it or throw it Free Radical - The ball bounces around a few times, making it really hard to catch Teleporter - The ball teleports on the field a few times before stopping somewhere on the field Static Zing - The ball is electric and will shock the first person to touch it Meteor Ball - The ball is thrown so fast that it&apos;s hard to see! On the PlayStation 2, the game uses traditional button-based controls. On the Wii, the player can swing the Wiimote to bat and pitch. On the Nintendo DS, there are two control modes. The player can either use the control pad and the B button or tap/swing the stylus on the touchscreen to pitch/bat. </story>

    <story>Backyard Baseball 2007 is a baseball game with kids, including young versions of, at the time of release, active MLB players. The graphics are on the cartoony side and the play on the field mostly arcade oriented. The majority of time is spent with batting or pitching which rely on timing, there is also active fielding and management of the base runners. Power-ups can be activated when the power meter is filled up and give certain advantages, e.g. the split ball power-up for pitchers causes the ball to divide into two. There are various difficulty options which can be turned on or off like automatic fielding or deactivating bat aim (when activated, the player actively has to aim into the direction the ball is supposed to fly). The game modes are quick matches (also available for two players), a season mode with the ability to change the lineup and some statistics and two mini games (Home Run Derby and Fielder&apos;s Challenge which is basically fielding training). The player can either use pre-defined or customized teams and some things (e.g. the young MLB athletes or better leagues to play in) have to be unlocked by completing achievements.</story>

You will be accordingly rewarded on your successful actions and achievements on a Bad Boy rating system. You can follow all the laws and avoid unneccesary damage or take the opposite approach and be a Bad Boy. There&apos;s a good amount of different weapons from pistols and shotguns to automatic assault rifles and grenades. Environments are fully destructable. You can use a quick aiming and shooting Action mode, or search for clues and evidence using the Explore mode.</story>

Accordingly, each instrument has its own &apos;career&apos; path in game. If you are doing the vocals for your band, you have to sing along in time to the music, matching the pitch as closely as possible. Lead and bass guitar is played by holding down the fret buttons and strumming as the appropriate fret icons cross the strike line on screen. Drums are done similar to the guitars, hitting the correct drum pad&apos;s/cymbals at the correct time. The better you do, the more points you score, however if you make too many mistakes, you will fail the song. You can either play alone on any of the instrument careers, or you can play with up to three friends on one console or online to compete with other players and bands from across the world. Songs featured include Duran Duran&apos;s Rio, Don McLean&apos;s American Pie, Evanescence&apos;s Bring Me To Life and Queen&apos;s Crazy Little Thing Called Love.</story>

    <story>An dark and evil force has spread over the land of Barbaria. Rumors say that the evil wizard called Zaugg is responsible. Prophecies foretell of a savior of the land who can prove to be a champion and defeat Zaugg. Ten Barbarians, all with their own reasons to hate Zaugg, come forward, each willing to destroy the wizard and prove themselves the hero of prophecy. Barbarian is a 3D vs. fighting game in a fantasy setting, inspired in gameplay largely by the Power Stone series. The game features ten characters who battle it out in fully three-dimensional, multi-level arenas, including castles, sewers, shipwrecks, swamps and caverns. Training mode includes tutorials for all of the game&apos;s moves and a practice session against a live opponent. Versus mode allows players to set up any fight they want, including four-player battles. The game&apos;s main single player mode is Quest mode. Players select one of the ten characters, each of which has their own storyline. The story includes fights against all the other characters in the game and also features mirror matches. In some of the fights, opponents bring some lesser minions with them for support. After a fight is won, players can select which opponent to take on next, allowing for different paths trough the story. Also after a fight, players can update their characters, raising their attributes like life, strength, damage dealt or magic regeneration time and also unlock special abilities like double jumps or a berserker mode. The fighting system is based on two basic buttons, one for weak and quick, one for strong and slow attacks. Stringing button combinations together enables combos, which each character having their own set. Some combos unleash magical attacks, which require the magic bar to be filled. Landing combos successfully enables additional rune attacks. Blocking and counters are also possible. The game&apos;s levels feature many objects to pick up that can be used as throwing or melee weapons. Objects come in different weights and require a certain amount of strength to pick up.</story>

    <story>Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses is based on the 2006 direct-to-video animated movie of the same name and the story is loosely based on the fairy tale The Twelve Dancing Princesses. Barbie is cast as Genevieve, one of the twelve princesses who live with their windowed father King Randolph in a castle. They live a frivolous live, so Randolph brings over his cousin Duchess Rowena to raise them as proper princesses. She makes their lives miserable however and poisons the king, so they flee to a magical world brought to life through a story of their mother. Rowena traps them there, along with Genevieve&apos;s friend Derek, and they need to use a goblet to collect mystical water that can cure their father. The player controls Genevieve in a full 3D environment, but with a small amount of freedom and sometimes with brief branching. She can be moved in any direction and can jump while twirling, to complete platform sections or to avoid water that kills instantly. The game uses many moving platforms, elevators, gaps and platforms that disappear when she stands on them too long. There is no health system and she has an unlimited amount of lives, respawning right away at the last point. Along the way she can collect gems. She sometimes meets animals she can pet. There are many sections with short mini-games activated by walking into large, spinning coins. In one of them a cat is controlled in a game of Breakout, bouncing an apple to bring down leaves from a tree or using a water bubble. In another Genevieve needs to throw berries towards birds in a nest with a moving obstacle blocking the path. Another section offers a jigsaw puzzle that needs to be completed to open a door. Between gameplay sections there are many animated cut-scenes. After the initial section a hub is entered that leads to four different worlds where the eleven princesses can be found. They are eventually brought back to the central hub by assigning the correct gem to them. The hub levels contain more mini-games next to the main exploration. She needs to guide a water bubble to collect music notes, design a dance choreography and a water fountain show, follow dance instructions similar to the Dance Dance Revolution games, use a slingshot to get flowers on waterlilies, and create a rainbow by moving a cloud to collect colours while avoiding dark clouds. There is a falling block puzzle game where the colours of the rainbow need to be gathered by matching gems of an identical colour in a group of three, horizontally or vertically, while dark clouds appear and remove blocks. Many mini-games are often repeated multiple times for the different princesses.</story>

    <story>Barnyard is an offering from THQ based on the movie of the same name from Nickelodeon. You arrive at the farm as a newbie cow, and must complete quests and earn respect in order to win keys that allow you to advance through the barnyard map. Movement is accomplished with the WASD or arrow keys, while the mouse controls the camera angle. Other keys access your inventory and the map, allow you to aim and squirt milk at opponents (even when you play as a boy!), and confirm menu selections. The map is fairly large and there are plenty of things to do beyond the missions and quests your fellow animals assign you. There are places to explore, barrels to break, and minigames like whack-a-raccoon, bowling, and bicycle races. As you play, you need to keep up your stamina, which decreases as you run around the farm. A good sleep is important; you need to be rested to fight off marauding raccoons and coyotes. And do remember not to let the Farmer catch you standing on two feet!</story>

    <story>An updated remake of Baroque, a post-apocalyptic RPG game in which all hell has literally broke loose on earth. As the game starts, the world has been devastated by a heat wave and left nothing but demon infested ruins and a mysterious Nerve Tower which many claim that holds the answers to the apocalypse. You play as an amnesiac survivor who decides to enter the tower in search for clues to both your identity and the reasons behind the apocalypse. The game plays as an RPG dungeon-crawler, in which you control your character and attempt to clear each floor in the tower from monsters, earning experience and items and only occasionally journeying outside the tower to get weapons and equipment from a few NPCs. The PS2 remake adds additional floors, items and creatures and updates the whole game with a completely polygonal engine (the original used 2D sprites to depict characters and monsters). Furthermore, the point of view has been changed from first person to third person and the gameplay has been modified accordingly to make the game more of an action-RPG than the original.</story>

Playing as both Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego, Batman, you will need to hunt evil forces in familiar locations such as Arkham asylum, Gotham City, but also in the Himalaya. Using both stealth and brutal skills, you take on enemies in true beat-em-up style. Batman has a vast array of moves, from kicks and punches to more exotic special moves. Multiple enemies can be attacked at once, and there are tricks to break through enemies&apos; defenses. Also, certain attacks can only be used as a finishing move when opponents are weakened. Next to the melee combat, Batman carries his Bat Utility Belt with a Batgrapple to reach higher areas, the Batarang and gadgets such as smoke and flash grenades, a lockpick, camera hacker and an optical wire to peek from behind corners. Certain levels turn Batman Begins into a racing game, as you drive the shiny Batmobile at high speeds though Gotham City. During these missions, your progress is measured by a reputation meter, which increases when you take out cops and thugs, and decreases when you harm civilians. There is nitro available for even higher speeds and an armour meter shows the status of your car.</story>

    <story>Set 40 years before the Sci-Fi Channel&apos;s 2004 Battlestar Galactica miniseries, the game acts as a prequel to the events in the new series. Players control Captain William Adama as he participates in 15 missions leading up to the end of the First Cylon War. Missions are tightly scripted. Players control three varieties of Viper fighters, as well as captured Cylon raiders, depending on the needs of the mission. Players also will man the stationary defense turrets on board the Galactica. Missions have clear goals, often with time limits, and are expressed and tracked through voiced radio chatter between wingmen and Galactica&apos;s war room. Players are graded in a variety of areas after each level (including accuracy and keeping wingmen alive), and unlock upgrades and bonus material for high ratings. Players control their craft from either a first or third person view. Fighters have unlimited ammo, missiles, and auto-repair any damage taken, but only if enough recharging energy is available. Firing weapons and using afterburners drain energy, and the fighter only repairs itself when the energy level is full. Players must be aware of their energy usage to keep from running out at critical moments. Missiles on every craft can also be configured on the fly through an option in the pause menu. Pilots can program missiles to have increased power at the cost of speed, or increase maneuverability at the cost of blast radius. This system allows players to adapt their missiles to the current needs of the mission, from swatting down formations of fighters to breaking through a capital ship&apos;s defenses. Though it acts as a prequel to the new series, art and design is pulled from the original 1978 Battlestar Galactica. The intro from the original series is used. Cylons Raiders, Colonial Vipers, and the Galactica itself use the original designs, Cylons themselves look like the original chrome toasters, and the reptilian race that created them (in the original series, not the reboot) make appearances.</story>

The Alpha Section forces, who are in charge of protecting citizens, seem to be completely ineffective, not even fighting the DomZ. In the midst of this situation, the secretive organization IRIS alleges that the Alpha Section is involved in a massive government conspiracy, and seeks to expose the truth through journalism. You control the young reporter/photographer Jade, with her companions Pey&apos;j and Double H. After experiencing first-hand a DomZ attack, she is contacted by IRIS, who recruit her as an action reporter. Jade is now tasked with infiltrating the Alpha Section, exposing the government conspiracy, and ultimately finding the truth for herself.

There are several mini-games and even an online ranking system (used by entering codes online after they are assigned in-game when the game is saved).

These include a gliding cape to clear large gaps, a heavy cape to push floor buttons and a radioactive cape to activate electronics. He also has a plunger grapple to let him hit buttons that are out of reach and a squirt gun, both of which are operated from the first-person mode and the standard platformer spin attack. Enemies come in three types- grunts, throwers and seekers. Grunts are defeated with a spin attack. Throwers throw projectiles, which you must hit back at the them with the spin attack and seekers cannot be defeated directly, but must be lured to an air vent, which sucks them in. There are five levels, each themed around a particular person&apos;s temptation and a final boss fight The boss in each case is the Bad Apple and is defeated a different way each time, essentially requiring you to work out a puzzle. The levels have various items to collect to unlock things like songs and videos and also multiplayer games like tic tac toe and darts, each with a Larry twist.</story>

    <story>The Bigs 2 is an arcade-oriented baseball game. During matches, the player takes the role of the active player, e.g. the batter, and tries to make a successful move. Successful actions fill up a power meter and when it is full, the player can unleash powerful abilities- Big Blast (an automatic home run when hitting the ball as batter) or Big Heat (a power pitch). In contrast to the main console version, this version is more similar to the predecessor. The only change which has made its way into this version is the wheelhouse system which shows shows the high risk zones of each batter. Actually bringing a ball through these zones rewards a big hit to his overall effectiveness. The other additions like the Big Slam ability and new mini games are not present. The Become A Legend career mode is identical to the predecessor&apos;s Rookie Challenge.</story>

These motion controls include drumming the remote and nunchuk when trying to speed up and using the remote as a bat when hitting. Instead of a traditional season mode as in many other baseball simulations, in The BIGS there is a mode titled Rookie Challenge, where the player creates a ballplayer and tries to lead him and his team to the World Series. Another mode, Home Run Pinball, puts a hitter in the middle of Times Square, New York, with the aim to hit balls into windows and neon lights.</story>

    <story>Blitz- The League is the first football game with no NFL license in many years - because EA signed an exclusive deal with the NFL, Midway developed one without the license. The game has 17 fantasy teams all with their own look and feel - from personalities to logos. The game differentiates itself further from official games by giving the players an off-field presence, often involving sex, performance-enhancing drugs and violence. The game has input from the writer for Playmakers, the football-based soap opera the NFL forced ESPN to cancel. Blitz- The League has 8-man teams, and makes spectacular action-packed moves easier than in real life. Impressive moves boost your Clash meter, which allows you to pull off unrealistic moves, such as easier running due to Bullet Time, and some brutally tough defences tackles. If these tackles happen frequently enough the players will fight hockey-style, lunging into wild tackles. The team with the most tackles from this gains the Unleashed mode, which has even more gruesome moves, of a style the NFL would not allow to be associated with their product. Additional features include multiplayer action with head-to-head online play and complete customization options of players, teams, stadiums and more. Lawrence Taylor appears as the poster boy.</story>

    <story>Following the events of Legacy of Kain- Blood Omen, over 200 years the vampire Kain has assembled an army of vampires to take over the world of the humans. Fighting across Nosgoth, goal is to make his way to the great city of Meridian and take control of this stronghold. However upon reaching the gates of the city, the army is challenged by the Serafan Order, an organized force of vampire hunters and it&apos;s leader, the magical Serafan lord. Kain engages the Serafan Lord in single combat, and is struck down and defeated, Kain&apos;s sword, the Soul Reaver, is claimed by his enemy. Unconscious for 200 years, Kain awakes under the care of the vampire Umah to a world he barely recognizes. Having lost it&apos;s army, the vampires have been hunted down by the Serafan and only a few remain. The city of Meridian is ruled under martial law by the Serafan Order and demands great things of it&apos;s citizens. Strange Glyph magic is used to power machines and fuel industry, but at the same time is deadly to vampires and used as wards throughout the city. Kain swears vengeance on the opponent who defeated him and seeks to reclaim his place as ruler of the vampires. The Legacy of Kain- Blood Omen 2 is a 3rd person adventure game, more similar in perspective to Soul Reaver than the first Blood Omen game. The player controls from behind Kain&apos;s shoulder and can move him in different directions, attack, jump, use dark gifts and grab on to ledges. Kain&apos;s life energy steadily depletes and must be replenished constantly by drinking blood. Blood is found by consuming any living creature nearby, often requiring defeating an enemy through combat first. As Kain consumes blood, his meter is filled up. Once full, Kain gains additional health. Kain also learns new dark gifts throughout the game, by defeating boss creatures. Some gifts include- the ability to blend into mist, fire projectiles, use projectile telekinesis or make a great horizontal leap. Many of these abilities can be used to perform stealth kills which will instantly defeat a foe. Kain will fight using his bare hands, or by picking up daggers, swords, axes and other weapons. These weapons all attack differently, eventually breaking, and can also be thrown at enemies from afar. The Serafan use Glyph magic, partially because it is deadly to vampires. Kain will often encounter areas where he is barred from progress because of Glyph barriers and must find a way around them. Additionally, glyphs function similar to electricity in that they power machines and switches. Many of the puzzles featured in Blood Omen 2 involve needing to create a glyph circuit in order to deliver power to a specific point. Glyph energy glows as it travels down it&apos;s connection, allowing the player to see exactly where the energy spark is.</story>

    <story>Seduced by the power offered to him, a samurai allows harm to come to his infant son. The son, fated to destroy the 48 Fiends, has 48 body parts removed, one by each demon. The samurai sets the remains adrift along a river, where the still-living child is discovered by a kindly doctor. After raising the child, the doctor operates on him, replacing his missing parts with mechanical ones. Knowing the child&apos;s destiny, the doctor replaces his missing arms with sword arms, attaches a repeating rifle to one arm, and a cannon to one leg. The game begins with the now-adult Hyakkimaru beginning his quest to reclaim his body parts from the Fiends. Soon joined by the child-thief Dororo, the pair embark on a quest against ancient Japanese demons and the monsters they create. Blood Will Tell is an action game where the player controls Hyakkimaru, a man whose body parts were stolen by demons when he was a child. His destiny is to reclaim each of his body parts, which allow him to increase his stats such as HP and power, as well as optional special functions (for example, the eye displays the game in colour, while the vocal chords allow him to speak). Hyakkimaru wields a sword, which can be used to attack enemies - he can also swap for his two smaller swords concealed within his arms. As he uses the swords, they level up and increase in power. Hyakkimaru can also charge up a sword attack, and if released at the correct time, is given the opportunity to enter a series of button presses for combos. If the enemy is killed during this combo, the player can perform a finishing move with the Triangle button which can yield bonus items ranging from health items to swords. Hyakkimaru is also outfitted with a repeating rifle and a cannon in his leg. While these are very powerful, they both require their own ammo and cannot be used without it. The gun can be fired rapidly at foes, while the cannon must be charged and aimed for a powerful shot. Both of these weapons have the advantage of being long-range weapons, unlike his swords which must be used at close quarters. At a certain point in the game, Hyakkimaru meets the child thief, Dororo. Dororo often assists Hyakkimaru during combat, and can be issued commands, such as &apos;fight&apos;, &apos;evade&apos;, &apos;collect items&apos; or &apos;search&apos;. Sometimes the pair will split up, and Dororo will be playable on his own. These sections are more puzzle-based, with the thief pulling switches to activate puzzles, dodging traps, and stealing items. Dororo can throw rocks from a distance, and later gets smoke bombs which are more incapacitating.</story>

    <story>There are things in the world that humanity should not know about, and things it must be protected from. It is these things that the Brimstone Society hunts, and their newest agent for the cause is the half-vampire codenamed BloodRayne. Her mission will take her from clearing out the walking dead and man-sized insects in the swamps of Louisiana to hunting down members of the secretive Gegengheist Gruppe branch of the Nazi military around the world, as well as the monsters they unwittingly awakened. Rayne&apos;s primary weapons against both monsters and men are the blades attached to her arms, and as the game progresses she will gain additional attacks to string together. Rayne can also hold many weapons, such as pistols, shotguns, and sub machine guns, at once, but she is not overly attached to them and will discard any weapon that runs dry. Her enhanced vampiric strength even allows her to rip up mounted gun emplacements and fire them from the hip. Another vampiric strength is her ability to drain the blood out of any human she can grab in order to restore her health. By killing enemies Rayne&apos;s rage meter will fill, eventually allowing her to enter Blood Rage, slowing the world around her and gaining new combo attacks that can dismember or totally cut in half weaker opponents. Rayne&apos;s ability to perceive the world will grow as the game progresses as well, allowing her to see living things through walls, zoom in on distant targets, and speed up her perception that everything, herself included, appear to slow down.</story>

    <story>During the XGC (X-Genome Code) Incident one year ago, riots raged over the earth by beasts that did not show the XCG, and all over the country small earthquakes shook the land. The cause was unknown, but as the Crest Incident came to an end and the rioting and earthquakes subsided, people began to claim that all was due to the influence of the Stone Seal. Although the Stone Seal has been locked away, the rioting and earthquakes have returned. This time, the incidents are on a larger scale than those of a year ago. What could be behind it all? Bloody Roar 4 is the last title in the series, and is once again a full-3D fighting game featuring the series&apos; trademark transformation abilities. Unlike previous titles in the series, the beast gauge now acts as its own health bar; if a character&apos;s health gauge is depleted, they will automatically transform. The game features 18 playable fighters and a variety of game modes, including standard arcade, versus, time-attack, training, and survival modes. Of special mention is the career mode, in which fighting battles will earn so-called &amp;quot;DNA points,&amp;quot; which can be spent on abilities and equipment to customize a character for use in other modes.</story>

To set the dice off, you must roll the top face of the die you&apos;re standing on next to the same number of interconnected die with the same face (i.e. connect five 5&apos;s, four 4&apos;s). After a set period of time, the dice will explode, igniting any dice that the explosion touches that either match the number, or are one lower. This game is very fast-paced - you have to keep moving, because if you&apos;re on top of an exploding die, you get knocked out and you lose the game. There are several modes of play in Bombastic - Trial Mode, where you try to clear 100 levels; Story Mode, where you progress through stages trying to solve preset puzzles and fight bosses, and Battle Mode, where you fight against four opponents and try to stay alive as long as you can. In addition to the standard Bombastic mode, you can also unlock classic Devil Dice mode, where the dice sink into the ground instead of exploding.</story>

    <story>Bomberman Hardball is an action game with four different game modes- Arena, Tennis, Golf and Baseball. The three sports games tend towards the fun-sport category (relatively simple controls and physics), but are still grounded in the real rule set- there are no power-ups or special moves. The controls of all three sports follow the genre standards- in Tennis, the player walks towards the ball and hits it, Golf has the standard two-click controls and in Baseball the control switches between pitching (selecting a pitch type and aim) and batting (aiming the hit). All three modes feature either exhibition or tournament play; a few Bomberman characters with different abilities and other playing options, e.g. in Tennis the player can choose between single/double and different courts. Arena has the standard Bomberman gameplay- multiple characters walk around in overhead maps and lay bombs in order to kill the competition. Bombing away destructible blocks may reveal power-ups which have positive (e.g. laying more bombs at once or higher walking speed) or negative (e.g. negating the positive power-ups) effects when picked up. Besides the classic deathmatch, there are also a few other game modes available- star battle (collecting stars), crown battle (the winner needs to find and pick up the crown) and point battle. Each match can also be customized, e.g. handicap, number of power-ups or time limit. The Living Mode allows to create a custom character with unlockable outfits and view AI controlled matches. Except Baseball (restricted to two players), up to four players can participate in matches.</story>

The nunchuck can also be used to control the facial expressions in Strike-a-pose sequences, but is not required. For karaoke, Boogie includes a USB microphone. Each song can be played as a dance or a karaoke game. Players either match the rhythm and pitch, or match the song&apos;s beats to dance. Variation and combos are encouraged, as too many similar moves will lower the score. By performing well in the dances, a Boogie meter is filled. When full the player can execute a special move. While dancing, bonus items appear such as multipliers, tokens and meter boosts. The game features a story mode centered around an intergalactic singing and dancing competition. There are five different characters, each with a unique story. For all other modes of play, players can create custom avatars based upon the five base characters, with a chapter in the story mode for each of them. Token collected during gameplay can be traded in for new songs, stages and outfits. There is also a mode where players can manipulate the camera to record their own music videos.</story>

    <story>Bratz Rock Angelz chronicles the adventures of the 4 main Bratz franchise girls -- Jade, Sasha, Chloe, and Yasmin -- as they follow their globetrotting fashion dreams on their way to start a world famous rock band. It starts when Jade receives a dream internship at a high fashion magazine with a tyrannical editor-in-chief who also employs twin sisters who happen to be Jade&apos;s arch-nemeses. Jade does not last long at this internship. She and her friends decide to found a competing fashion magazine and the adventure rolls on from there. The game features 9 chapters and the gameplay alternates between 3D adventure and assorted minigames. In the 3D adventure mode, the player guides the current Bratz character around various rendered sets and interacts with other characters, who invariably give the Bratz goals to carry out in order to further the storyline. The minigames include a fruit smoothie mixing game, where the player controls the smoothie stand and must make fruit smoothies per the Bratz girl&apos;s real-time specifications; a magazine layout minigame; a minigame where the player must pick out the right clothes for the editor&apos;s business trip; and many others. Successful completion of a minigame unlocks more outfits that the player can dress the Bratz characters in.</story>

    <story>Bratz The Movie follows its predecessors, Bratz Rock Angelz and Bratz Forever Diamondz, however the game uses a higher defonition than previous games. Four playable characters- Yasmin, Cloe, Sasha and Jade. Blingz in this game appear orange instead of blue for the predecessors, but still act as money for buying with. The phone is also similar with the mobile phone menu, where you can read messages, and see the objective, what the player currently has to do, as well as the home feature. The player can again adopt a pet (cat or dog), and take them to pet shows, accessorize them, etc... The pet helps in certain objectives and tasks. A new feature to this game is your pet can find extra objects while not on an task, including extra treats, large amounts of money and the characters coins (which can only be found in this way). Like its predecessors, the game has an explorable roam similar to Grand Theft Auto series. New features in the game include fashion designing (design full outfits), new mini-games, new tricks in the ice rinks, as well as learning to play the guitar in the new music academy. The game also re-explores London from Bratz Rock Anglez (with an additional subway added) and New York from Bratz Forever Diamondz (without the access of exploring Central Park). Each place (London, New York, Stylesville) you visit, there is one concert or fashion show you need to accomplish. </story>

    <story>Brave is a young native American boy who lives in the forest. As he wants to become a warrior, the elderly shaman Grey Bear prepares an adventure and hides carvings that will grant him new skills. During the search, however, the village is brutally attacked by the demonic creature Wendigo. Brave is the only one who can defeat it, but in order to do that, he has to track the path of the mysterious shaman Spirit Dancer, discover his past, and find the means to defeat the evil force. Brave is a 3D third-person platformer with puzzles. Set in worlds with different themes (ice world, volcanic world, wastelands, forest...), Brave can roam freely, but certain parts are only opened up after solving quests. The boy can jump, duck, climb, and do basic attack moves. While observing, for certain actions, and when using ranged weapons, a first-person view is available as well. During the adventure, Brave acquires new abilities, which allow him to track creatures by smell or their tracks, mimic animals&apos; sounds to lure or distract them, summon creatures, or invoke shaman powers to become an animal (an eagle, a bear, a rabbit and even a skunk). Health is acquired by killing animals or destroying vegetation. Brave can also collect up to five eagle feathers, which allow him to stock up on shaman power that provides superior strength for a short time. The exploration gameplay has been mixed with action sequences, where you canoe down river rapids, or ride on a buffalo or an eagle while fighting. There is a strong emphasis on movement and platform-jumping, and there is an adjustable difficulty level, reflected in the amount of hints Grey Bear provides through a mobile stone. Next to the abilities, there are different weapons to be found, such as spears, tomahawks and bows. Additionally, Brave can search for secret totems that open up concept art in the menu.</story>

    <story>The world is called Deep Earth. The world is a huge underground complex of cities and labyrinths. The world is populated by people who have never seen the sky and the sun in their lives. The world is dark and hostile, and knows no mercy. Technology is well developed in this world, but the society is ruled by a cruel law, dividing all the citizens into classes, depending on the their D-ratio - a form of identifying people and assigning to them a social status at the same time. This is the reality of mankind somewhere in a fantasy universe, where the hero Ryu is thrown into. Ryu is a simple guard, a ranger with a low D-ratio - his job is to help to protect the citizens from genics - artificial monsters who have gone wild. During one of such routine patrols, Ryu runs into a mysterious silent girl named Nina, and saves her from a monster. Willing to protect her, Ryu discovers in himself a devastating power. He is now determined to do something for the society of Deep Earth - and perhaps to guide them to the surface of the planet... Dragon Quarter is a radical departure from the previous titles of the long-running series, and from standard console-style RPGs in general. The game is built as a huge dungeon crawler, with no overworld map. The combat is much more strategic than usually- each character has action points (AP), which can be used to move around the screen during an enemy encounter, and to perform a variety of combo attacks. There is no magic in the game, and many of the items you find in dungeons are random. All the enemies are visible on screen. Depending on who first initiated a physical contact, your party or the enemies get an extra turn in battles. The game allows (and even encourages) the player to restart the game from the beginning, keeping the items and the party experience (extra experience you get from battles and from treasure chests, which you can store and then assign to any of the characters). The game also features a special counter - Ryu can use his traditional dragon transformation abilities, but the counter raises with each such transformation, and when the counter reaches 100, the game is over. Raising your D-ratio allows you to access new areas every time when you re-play the game.</story>

    <story>No less than six years have gone by before the third installment in the Broken Sword series saw the light of day. The first two games (The Shadow of the Templars and The Smoking Mirror) delved into the Knights Templar and Mayan mythology. This time, George Stobbart and Nico Collard are after the Voynich Manuscript to unravel its mysteries. The Sleeping Dragon moves away from the 2D point-and-click concept from the earlier games and features a full 3D world, with a camera that does not rotate, but uses fixed cinematic perspectives, combined with full 5.1 sound. For the Windows version the game is no longer controlled through the mouse, but now through the keyboard, for the movement of the characters as well as all the actions. The player alternately controls George or Nico. Next to typical adventure gameplay such as exploration, conversations, and searching and combining items, there are also a few action sequences. The characters can duck, sneak, hang from ledges and move crates to reach higher areas. The locations visited throughout the game include The Congo, Paris, England, Czech Republic and Egypt.</story>

Brothers in Arms- Earned in Blood tells the story of Corporal Joe Red Hartsock as one of the thousands of paratroopers who landed in Normandy, France, on the eve of D-Day. Hartsock made an appearance in the previous game and now we get to see the events from his point of view, based on actual events and persons. Though the game engine remains largely unchanged, the A.I. has been significantly improved to offer a more challenging experience as the player tries to advance through the treacherous area known as the Bocage. The player fights in first person as Hartsock but also commands either two fireteams or a fireteam and a tank as using cover and suppression fire is critical to success. The game also offers an interesting multiplayer mode with the rare single-mission co-op option available for the PC, as well as skirmish maps and other mods such as Defense.</story>

    <story>Brunswick Pro Bowling is a bowling simulation game. In Career mode, after creating an avatar, players compete against the computer to work their way up from amateur to professional. The player character will increase in skill (e.g. strength, accuracy) and earn money while playing. This money can be used to buy clothing or a new bowling ball, which also affects skill. Quick Play mode, as the name suggests, allows for a quick round of bowling for one to four players. Making a throw is a little bit different depending on the platform the game is played on. Lining up on the alley to decide the direction of the ball stays the same, but on PlayStation 2 and PSP it&apos;s also necessary to set its spin. The next step is rolling the ball. On the Wii this is done by swinging the Wiimote and releasing the trigger button, where the speed of the release determines the spin of the ball. In the other versions a sickle-shaped meter is shown; pulling down on the analog stick sets the accuracy, and pushing it forward the strength of the release.</story>

    <story>Burnout is a arcade style racing game in the mold of the Test Drive or Need For Speed series. In this game, you are racing on realistic streets with real traffic to contend with. There are 6 courses on which to race, 3 of which are reminiscent of Europe, and 3 from the USA. There are several vehicles to choose from, ranging from compact cars to pickups. However, they are not based on real makes and models. One notable feature of Burnout is the Burn Meter. The Burn Meter is a gauge that is filled by performing reckless stunts, like racing into oncoming traffic, or power-drifting through corners. Once the Burn Meter is filled, your car gets a super speed boost.</story>

    <story>Racing a car is one thing, but racing into traffic at high speeds, where you are rewarded for the style of your crash, is another. This is the idea behind Burnout 2, which brings new modes and higher speeds compared to the original title. As usual, the aim is to speed around real life roadways, through the traffic ahead, while keeping all 4 wheels on the ground. Burnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing. Unlike many games which focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure. Designers have built an entire city and surrounding areas, and implement the race courses throughput the countie&apos;s streets. As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races. As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving. Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost burnout meter. Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to dive past buses, trucks and anything else that gets in the way. The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get! Burnout 2 contains a full campaign and custom car campaign. While you can unlock regular cars and tracks, later in the campaign you unlock more raceways like reverse tracks and one-way sprints. You can unlock over 20 cars like a Nascar, a 1920&apos;s gangster car, a Japanese muscle, and many customized vehicles with custom paint jobs and upgraded stats. Along with the same sense of speed and highly detailed crash animations as before, Point of Impact packages new modes of play. Pursuit mode has you playing the cop as you chase down the speeding motorists, and to win you must crash them out of the race. Or you can reverse that with a friend. You can flee from a friend while he attempts to chase you. Crash mode, as the name suggests, forces you to glide into crowded intersections to get the most cars involved in a pile-up as possible. The bigger the crash, the better. Up to 4 players can compete for the best score. Training and 2 player racing modes are also included.</story>

    <story>Burnout Dominator is an installment of the Burnout series for the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation Portable systems. The game is mainly focused on returned Burnouts feature - draining a complete boost meter without stopping wich was last seen in Burnout 2- Point of Impact. With return of Burnouts feature there were four new game modes added including Maniac Mode (players need to drive dangerously to get highest scores by earning drifts, air, oncoming and near misses. Chaining Burnouts in this mode increases the score multiplier), Drift Challenge (in this mode player need to obtain as many feet of drifting as possible. Chaining Burnouts also increases the score multiplier here), Near Miss Challenge (same as Drift Challenge, but player needs to score near miss bonuses), Burnout Challenge (also same as Drift Challenge, but focusing on obtaining Burnouts score). However, some options have been removed from the game - for instance Burnout Dominator doesn&apos;t feature Crash Mode, there is also no Traffic Checking Mode and Online Multiplayer. But PSP version features Burnout HQ where you can upload you score and download new track. The game consists of 12 different tracks, in 8 different real world locations. Each track has a forward and a reverse configuration.</story>

    <story>The fourth Burnout racing game puts you once again in the eye of traffic storms, where you do not only rush to be the fastest, but brutally, yet stylishly, take down your opponents. This is emphasized by impact time, which shows crashes in all their slowed-down glory, and the boost you receive after a successful wrecking. Reckless driving bumps your Revenge rank, unlocking new events. This can also be achieved by medal placings that grant new vehicles. Collectible signature takedowns, crashbreakers (detonate your vehicle, now also in some regular races) and aftertouch for precise havoc remain, but one of the major changes is the ability to check traffic. Non-racing vehicles are no longer a nuisance with the sole purpose of slowing you down. They can now be actively used to obstruct traffic or send them into your foes. The Road Rage mode (take down a set number of rivals within a time limit) and Crash mode make a return, but Traffic Attack is new - race against the clock and level the traffic at the same time. Other modes include regular races, grand prix races, Burning Lap (high-speed time attack), Eliminator (last one after each round is out) and a normal time attack mode. In the Crash mode, the multipliers and bonuses have been removed, and you cannot drive at full speed towards a crossroads. You have to time your start to receive a proper boost and then it is only about steering, crashbreakers and aftertouch. There are many new tracks and cars, a soundtrack with lots of famous artists, and a new world tour in different countries. Online multiplayer is available for up to six players. New off-line additions are the split-screen Traffic Attack and a hot-seat Crash Tour for up to six players, next to the familiar Road Rage, Crash Party and Crash Battle modes.</story>

The PlayStation 3 version features online play and allows users access to user created questions on the My Buzz! site as well as leaderboards that rank online play.

With an easy-to-use Buzzer in hand, go head-to-head against up to three of your mates or family to see if you have the skills you need to build a banana empire and be crowned King of the Jungle. Choose your monkey character with care each has a distinctly naughty personality and then take part in one of up to 40 wild and wacky mini games deep in the jungle. But the secret to success is not just having a laugh, as you find out if you have what it takes to demolish a Totem pole, beat out the craziest bongo beat with your Orang-utan drum instructor or base jump clutching an anvil! And if you survive all that not to mention being pelted with coconuts and eaten by lions - then it&apos;s &apos;farty&apos; time as you sit back in the jungle Jacuzzi and celebrate with your friends and the windy gorilla just watch out for the smelly bubbles!! Play is as simple as peeling a banana and the laughs as cheesy as a centipedes shoes. Just choose your character, select the colour of your monkey, enter your name and you are ready for tropical action. </story>

    <story>As part of the PlayStation 2’s holy trinity of casual gamer friendly franchises, which also includes EyeToy and SingStar, Buzz! is one of those rare cases where being a one trick pony is exactly what makes it so appealing. The initial games were simple interactive quiz games, whose big gimmick was that they came with a set of special game show buzzer controllers instead of relying on the traditional DualShock controller. The Buzz! Junior games though are a slightly different affair – you still use the simple five button buzzers, but to play mini-games not answer questions. As a sequel to Jungle Party this actually does pretty well, with a much more consistent range of mini-games than the original. There’s no separate single player mode any more though, with computer controlled opponents simply filling in the gaps. There’s also not much of a plot either, as you simply compete with other primary coloured robots at the Robot Academy. Thankfully this doesn’t involve a two hour maths exam, but instead mini-games like rhythm action variant Octo Beat, hammer throwing (but with robots), Whack-A-Mole with aliens, and cybernetic basketball. Few of the mini-games are genuinely original, and there are only twenty-five, but they are at least all entertaining. The only caveat to all this is that, unlike things like Mario Party, this is strictly for very young children. No one with an age in double digits is going to tolerate it for very long – but then that’s largely the point, since so few games are aimed at very young kids nowadays. Particularly if you’ve already got the buzzer controllers from a previous game (or aim to use them again) this is actually quite an effective form of interactive child quietener.

    <story>Buzz! The Schools Quiz is the sixth game in the Buzz! series, and like all other Buzz! titles it must be played using the USB ’Buzz! Buzzers’ controllers, instead of the regular controllers. The game is sold both with and without these Buzz! Buzzers and there are four buzzers per set. This means that using the PS2’s two USB connections, up to eight players can play at once. The game was developed in partnership with the Department for Education and Skills and expert educational consultancy Schoolzone for use in both classrooms and at home. As with all Buzz! Games, it’s set in a game show environment. Players answer questions on different subjects taken from the Key Stage 2 National Curriculum, aimed at children from age’s seven to eleven. There are several game play modes available, allowing players to play on just one subject or from a wide range. Team and single player modes are also available to allow different numbers of players to play at once. A Teacher feature gives the teacher control over how the game is played, allowing them to pause and involve children in the answers being given.</story>

    <story>Cabela&apos;s African Safari takes you to the wild&apos;s of Africa in search of the most valued trophies on the planet. Hunt in 5 different countries like South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, each with their own challenges and perils. You have several different firearms, rifles from the .243 (designed mostly for small antelopes) up to the .600 (for big game like Elephants and Rhinos), shotguns for bird hunting and small caliber hand guns designed to protect you against small predators. Each stage has five hunts, from tracking several small game, one big trophy game, bird hunting, herd hunting, in which you sit in the back of a jeep and try to bring down a trophy animal in the midst of a herd, and finally the Trophy Hunt in which you take down one of the Big 5 of Africa (Rhino, Leopard, Elephant, Cape Buffalo and the Lion). You also have a tracker which gives you clues on where to find your game, a porter to give you advice of which firearm to use and a guide to help you along and set up the hunts. Each hunt has a specific time limit so you won&apos;t have time to take in the beautiful surroundings in the game. The landscape is populated with all kinds of animals, most harmless and will run when they catch wind of you, but you have to watch out for predators who will attack, especially Hyenas, wild dogs and even leopards and cheetahs. Elephants and rhinos will attack to if they feel provoked. After completing a safari you can play it again in the Open Safari in the main menu if you want to go back to a favorite hunt, plus after you take down the Trophy Hunt animals you can go after them again on the main menu with the option called The Big Five and even hold tournaments to see who is the better hunter. A sure-fire winner for video game hunters.</story>

    <story>Another in the Big Game Hunting series, 2005 Adventures brings you 36 big game animals in 10 locations. Choose from many guns, bows, equipment, and clothing before heading out to take on these animals. Head out looking for whatever animal(s) you have tags for. Track your target through mountains, plains, hills, streams, and lakes. Swim across lakes and streams that are in your way and drive various vehicles to save time getting where you&apos;re going. Once you find your prey, get close enough to shoot without your target noticing you. Then take the shot! Play the game in quick hunt or career mode, or play with friends online. Go to your cabin to see the animals you have shot in career mode... you can even choose your what cabin you want out of six choices! Unlike many other hunting games that have you go out and kill what you can in a single day, you can take as many days as you need to bag your limit. Use tents to sleep away the nights, or walk around looking for possible spots to sit and wait for prey on the following day... just don&apos;t forget to eat and drink to keep up your energy. Play through rain and snow as well as clear weather conditions. Animals behave differently in different conditions, just like in real life.</story>

Keep your eyes open; there are secret stumps in each level, which if shot can unlock extra levels and other items. In most levels, you will be assisted by a native guide, who will both draw the attention of the local wildlife, and assist you in killing them. The story features you, a world famous hunter, who has just found out a old friend, Bullseye Bill, is missing. Retrace his steps around the world, helping other people along the way.</story>

    <story>Cabela&apos;s Dangerous Hunts 2009 puts the player in the shoes of Flint Abrahams, a famous hunter who travels around the world in search of hunting challenges. The player spends much time exploring the wilderness looking for traces of prey. Because they can be hard to make out, a Hunter&apos;s Sense is included to reduce the world to grayscales and make animals stand out. The game however maintains an arcade approach and lets the player shoot everything in his way, without regard for a patient approach. The game&apos;s Career mode has timed levels forcing quick gameplay, and the different stages are set all around the world. When facing larger animals such as bear or lions, a Hand-to-Claw Combat mode is often triggered automatically to fend them off through a number of quick time event key presses. Another option is the Adrenaline mode where time comes almost completely to a stop, making it easier to line up the shots and get a lot of kills. Different types of equipment become available to assist in the hunt, and in certain missions it is not required to kill animals – tranquillizing them is sufficient.</story>

    <story>This version of Call of Duty- World at War is very different from its counterparts. Aside from the graphics engine, the violence is toned down, resembling its predecessor and it features different storylines, locations and missions from the other versions. The story is divided into four campaigns. The first takes place at the beginning of the war in the South Pacific as the player takes control of Pvt. Joe Miller serving with the American 2nd Marine Division as they start out in basic training in North Carolina. This level lets the player learn the controls of the game and then fastforwards to the Guadalcanal (as though the training mission was a flashback) where the player must survive with his company. There are four more missions, two on the island of Betio and two on the island of Saipan. The second part takes place in Europe after D-Day with four missions divided by two different experiences. The first two has the player take command of Pvt. Lucas Gibson of the American 80th Infantry Division as he and his squad make their way through Luxembourg and finally through Bastone mounted on a Sherman tank, trying to break through Nazi lines. The last two missions let the player take control of Pvt. Tom Sharpe of the British 6th Airbone Division, battling through the ruins of Bastone and the town of Bure. The third part only consists of two missions that are divided between Pvt. Sharpe and Pvt. Gibson and is set in the closing days of the war in Europe. The first mission takes place in Wesel where Pvt. Sharpe and his division must find a way across the Rhine. The second has Pvt. Gibson and his division battle through the town of Braunau am Inn, the birthplace of Adolph Hitler, as they need to stop a V2 rocket from being launched. The last campaign reverts back to Pvt. Joe Miller at the end of the Pacific Theatre, this time with two missions on the island of Okinawa, with the last mission having the player take Castle Shuri in an attempt to capture Okinawa and open the gate to the Japanese mainland. The gameplay is of the first-person shooter kind and is told through in game cutscenes as well as stock footage of World War II, both black &amp; white and color. The controls are basic, with a main weapon and secondary along with two grenades (smoke and frag). Movement is done through the left analog stick with aiming through the right one. Players can fire their weapon using the R1 button and switch between using Triangle, manually reloading them using the Square button and aim down the sight using the L1 button. Jumping and hurling obstacles (when prompted) is done through the X button, a melee attack can be obtained through the R3 button and sprinting through the L3 button. The O button is used for crouching while holding the button down will let the player&apos;s character prone. Players can obtain ammo through fallen comrades and new weapons by standing over top of the weapon and holding the Square button. Likewise, fallen enemy weapons can be obtained this way. There is no number of preset lives and once a player is killed he can restart from a previous checkpoint. There is no health bar system, instead it resembles Medal of Honor- Vanguard where once the player starts to sustain an considerable amount of damage, the view will start to become red. This can be stopped by taking cover away from enemy fire which will allow the players health to replenish.</story>

    <story>In the second Call of Duty game for consoles, players again take to battle in The Second World War. As with other Call of Duty games, focus is on the characters and their drama amidst the furious, heavily scripted, first-person action. As a private new to war in America&apos;s most legendary infantry division, nicknamed the Big Red One for the distinctive patch they wore, players will fight through the game as a team in the Fighting First, and will be affected by the loss of friends on the battlefield. Players will have to re-enact the successes of World War II through a wide variety of land, sea and air missions in Africa, Sicily and Normandy, by using vehicles including tanks, jeeps, armored cars and half-tracks. Success will depend on how well players can move, shoot and complete the objectives that a commanding officer provides before each mission. The Xbox and PS2 versions offer multiplayer games with up to 16 players.</story>

    <story>The third main Call of Duty game centers around Operation Cobra in Normandy, France, the World War II operation planned by United States Army General Omar Bradley to break out from the Normandy area after the previous month&apos;s D-Day landings. You play as 4 allied sides with American, Canadian, British and Polish soldiers in 14 chronological singleplayer missions covering the 88 days leading up to the liberation of Paris. Surprisingly, you cannot play as the French 2nd Armored Division that actually liberated Paris. The battles are usually dramatic with many fights and scripted events at the same time, consisting of infantry and vehicles, with semi-destructible environments. In between, there are cinematics that explain the events. A few gameplay mechanics have been kept intact or make a return- slight auto aim, the damage system that allows you to recover if you hide for a moment, and smoke grenades. New features include the ability to toss back unexploded grenades and actions requiring a successful series of button combinations. This can occur in hand-to-hand combat where you can yank the weapon out of enemy soldiers&apos; hands. Enemies work in groups, try different tactics and search for cover. The main multiplayer modes are standard deathmatch (battle), team deathmatch (team battle), Capture the Flag (either with two flags or two sides trying to control a single, neutral flag) and Headquarters (two sides either defend or attack a structure, and players can now respawn after dying). The new mode, War, is similar to the gameplay of the Battlefield series. Two teams start with two control points each, and one neutral flag in the middle. The objective is to control all five flags. There are multiple-occupancy vehicles (Sherman Tank, Panzer IV, Jeep, Horch, BMW, Harley), and several multiplayer classes- Rifleman, Heavy Assault, Light Assault, Medic, Scout, Support and Anti-Armor. Each class has unique abilities. There are also two rankings- a normal rank system during a single game where your abilities improve if you do well, and an overall TrueSkill ranking. Also, unlike the previous games, your team stays grouped together after a match and is not booted back to the lobby right away.</story>

    <story>A beat&apos;em&apos;up with characters taken from many Capcom and SNK games. The game system is centered around grooves which are selected before any battle. These different grooves alter the character&apos;s abilities to resemble different Capcom or SNK games. There are three grooves dedicated for each company, and even the option to define a custom groove. The EO of the GameCube and Xbox titles refers to a new groove- Easy Operation. Instead of the normal inputs needed to do special and super moves, these moves are instead done automatically by tapping the right thumb-stick in specific directions. Only a small part of each character&apos;s moveset can be accessed this way, however, and if the player does not select EO then the game will play the same as the arcade and previous releases. Playable characters come from the following games- 1. Street Fighter (Ryu, Ken, Eagle, Sagat) 2. Final Fight (Rolento) Street Fighter II (Guile, Chun-Li, Blanka, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Zangeif, M. Bison, Balrog, Vega) 3. Final Fight 2 (Maki) Super Street Fighter II (Cammy) 4. Super Street Fighter II Turbo (Akuma/Gouki) 5. Street Fighter Alpha (Dan) 6. Street Fighter Alpha 2 (Sakura, Shin Akuma/Gouki, Evil Ryu) 7. Darkstalkers (Morrigan) 8. Street Fighter III (Yun) 9. Rival Schools (Kyosuke) 10. Psycho Soldier (Athena) Fatal Fury (Terry, Joe, Raiden, Geese) Art of Fighting (Ryo, Yuri, King, Todoh) Fatal Fury 2 (Kim, Mai) Samurai Shodown (Haohmaru, Nakoruru) The King of Fighters &apos;94 (Kyo, Benimaru, Chang&amp;Choi, Rugal) 11. The King of Fighters &apos;95 (Iori) Fatal Fury 3 (Yamazaki) The King of Fighters &apos;96 (Vice) The King of Fighters &apos;97 (Orochi Iori) The Last Blade 2(Hibiki) Fatal Fury- Mark of the Wolves (Rock)</story>

    <story>Cole Gannon, a rookie in the ACME detective agency finds a set of GPS coordinates on the agency&apos;s computer server, which leads him to a museum in New York. The GPS coordinates involve a case dealing with the infamous thief Carmen Sandiego, who Cole wants to capture despite being still just in training. It seems Carmen wants to put back together a set of stolen tribal drums that will unleash an unspeakable power. There are two other ACME operatives, Jules and Shadow, who are working on the case in Siberia at the moment so they can only help Cole with advice through email messages. The game consists of exploring nine different locales all over the world from New York to Thailand. Each locale is broken down into several areas. Each area has different items to collect. The main items to collect are compasses. These will help in locating Carmen Sandiego&apos;s whereabouts. Another item Cole can collect are puzzle pieces. Collecting these will unlock a jigsaw puzzle for Cole to solve. Also for Cole to make his way through areas, he has to defeat some enemy combatants who possess key codes. A few key codes are needed to unlock forcefields, which block the pathways to get further into the area. To defeat enemies, Cole is equipped with a staff he can use to whack enemies with. He also comes equipped with a dart gun, which he can use to hit switches he can&apos;t reach otherwise. Cole must also move stealthily through each area to avoid security measures and to get a drop on unsuspecting enemy units. Cole has other moves he can perform such as pole vaulting with his staff, rolling from a crouch position, pressing his body close to a wall, double jumping, tightrope walking, and hanging from ledges, pipes, and even ziplines. During the game, players can access a menu with various tabs. The atlas tab gives educational factoids about the area Cole is in. The map tab gives detailed information about the area that Cole is currently exploring. The GPS tab gives information about where Carmen Sandiego will be heading next. The transport tab let&apos;s the player go back to the areas they previously explored in their current location. The communication tab lets the player receive messages from Jules and Shadow. .</story>

    <story>In Castlevania- Curse of Darkness you play Hector, a former Dracula servant and a Devil Forgemaster, who disowns his dark gifts and aims to live a normal life. This event left Dracula vulnerable to the attacks of the Belmont clan. Now that Dracula is vanished, you must fight back the curse cast upon all Europe. There is but one problem, another Dracula servant does not approve with your plan. Being a Devil Forgemaster now gives the player an ability to forge familiars to fight by your side. As the player himself, they have levels and they can even morph to a different stage depending which weapon you use to fight with them. The game has some basic role-playing elements such as character attributes and experience. Unlike Castlevania- Lament of Innocence, you are now able to use many types of weapons- Axes, swords, spears, knuckles and even shields for example. You can also craft your own weapons either by using an existing weapon as a base, and having some additional material such as bronze, steel and aluminium or having an extra amount of materials. The battle system allows you to lock on to an enemy and hit them with multiple combos. You have some control on your Innocent Devil, and can command it to use certain skills, guard you and join the fight.</story>

    <story>Castlevania- Lament of Innocence is the prequel to all Castlevania games previously released, explaining the connection and never-ending war between the Belmont family and Dracula. It is one of the first 3-D Castlevania games (the others being on the N64). The team who created the PS1 Castlevania- Symphony of the Night completely remake the formula. You play Leon Belmont, who was once a Baron for the King. After his betrothed, Sara, was kidnapped and taken to a large castle, Leon asked the Church for permission to command his underlings to attack the castle. Because of the Crusades going on in the East, he is denied such. But because of his love for Sara, he denounces his title and leaves, going with no weapon or clue to the castle. He is stopped by an alchemist named Rinaldo, who was once a vampire-hunter himself. He gives Leon the Whip of Alchemy, offers to help him further in his quest, and sends him on his way. The gameplay mixes a style of hack-and-slash with a sense of strategy. In order to gain new abilities, you must first master the previous ones. This also includes relics and orbs, which will greatly help you in your quest to rescue Sara. Relics allow you to do special abilities necessary to solving certain puzzles, while orbs combine with power-ups you pick up and can create massive offensive or defensive power. This makes the game incredibly addictive. You&apos;ll be trying to find every Relic and Orb and unlock every Skill. The game has many hidden secrets - In fact, most gamers will only find about two Relics through the entire game. There are also five hidden bosses, each giving you something very good. A few will give you whip power-ups, while others will give you orbs and relics. Getting the game&apos;s discovery rating to 100% is quite a task, but well worth it in the end.</story>

In total there are 19 minigames, in which the player is given control of 1 of the 3 main characters from the film. In the farmyard area, the player controls Wilbur the Pig, where he must find various items throughout the farm whilst keeping out of sight of the farmer and his sheepdog. Once a task has been completed on the farmyard, the game then moves to a minigame based loosely on the events of the film. You can control Wilbur in a runaway pram rolling down a hill and must keep the pram balanced until it comes to rest. Some of the games let the player control Templeton the Rat. In one minigame he must hurl rubbish at incoming birds in a rubbish dump using a catapult hastily built from the materials lying nearby. In another he must outpace a runaway egg in some tunnels under the dirt. The last playable character is Charlotte herself. These games generally involve the barn as a backdrop (in a 2D setting) with the goal of travelling from one side to the other by swinging from webs and dodging obstacles and catching flies.</story>

    <story>The iteration of the Chessmaster series on the PlayStation 2 contains most of the features available in the corresponding PC game - which, in this case, is Chessmaster 9000. You can play training games (with all the hints and analysis tools available), rated games (your rating changes after each play), puzzles (chess ones, not the build the picture type), learn chess by browsing through the hundreds of tutorials available in the Pandolfini&apos;s Chess School or watch famous games. There are, however, some new features in the PS2 version; the most useful one is the Online mode. Other is the living world of the Chessmaster Championships, where the AI&apos;s rating changes, too, as they play each other. The last one is more spectacular - a fantasy-themed - orcs vs. humans - game mode with animated chess sets and a 3D environment. You get to play chess in a forest, inside a castle and in the desert.</story>

    <story>ChoroQ has been described by many people as a CarPG in that while you do partake in tons of arcadeish races against other super deformed cars (called ChoroQs in the game), you also drive around three different towns, talking to the ChoroQs and doing quests and mini games. There&apos;s over 200 different body styles to unlock through the story mode (very few of them actually change the way your ChoroQ handles or performs; they&apos;re largely for show) and a wide range of parts you can buy to upgrade your car (either for performance or for looks). The game supports two player split screen where you can import your ChoroQs from your own individual adventures and battle each other and also compete against each other in a wide range of minigames.</story>

    <story>The Chronicles of Narnia- Prince Caspian is based off of the novels and movie of the same name, giving the player the opportunity to play as one of 20 different characters, including the four Pevensie children, Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter, as well as Prince Caspian. The story takes place 1 Human year or 1,300 Narnian years after the first movie/game, where an evil king called King Miraz has begun to conquer the lands of Narnia and Prince Caspian has summoned the four Pevensie siblings in order to help Narnia and Aslan bring unity back to the lands. The gameplay is similar to the first, basically hack-n-slash, moving through levels, battling through each levels enemies each with the characters unique battling tactics. There are six chapters/levels in all, with puzzles scattered through the levels and special Treasure Chests as well, that require certain amount of keys to open that will unlock special features such as artwork, pictures among others associated with the film. There is also a level made exclusive to the game that wasn&apos;t in the film or in the novel. The controls are dependent of the system, while the PS2, PS3 and Xbox 360 uses the d-pad and analog and main buttons, the Wii utilizes the Wii-remote and the PC uses the mouse and keyboard. There is also two-player co-op gameplay that can have a human player drop-in during a game.</story>

Play as Susan, Edmund, Lucy and Peter from the film, and journey through the Professor&apos;s house, the forests of Narnia and escape the attack on London during World War II. Depending on which level you&apos;re playing, you&apos;ll be able to play as at least two of the four children, although some levels require you to use all four. The four children all have different special abilities. Peter is the strongest of the bunch, so you can use him for fighting off enemies or breaking through barriers. Susan is a raged fighter and she can throw arrows, tennis balls and snowballs. Edmund is a decent melee fighter who can climb trees and walk on ice without breaking it. Lucy has the ability to heal the other children, go through small spaces and stand on big snowballs and make them roll. During each level you can switch between characters at any time. Scattered throughout the levels are coins, pink and green gems, and hidden shields that will give ratings at the end of the levels, ranging from fair to outstanding.</story>

    <story>You and your father are the newest residents of Long Life Town, a strange little town with even stranger characters. It is here that you meet the girl of your dreams - Literally. But she wants nothing to do with you. Your mission is to improve your reputation amongst the many inhabitants of the town by kissing them, so the girl of your dreams will fall in love with you. Kissing people requires you to complete certain tasks, ranging from something as simple as waiting until they feel happy, to more difficult and branching puzzles like helping someone find a job. Primarily, this game is a puzzle-solving adventure, where you explore the town, trying to figure out what to do next and how to do it. The more people you end up kissing, the higher your Heart Meter goes, which allows you to progress through the story, and attempt more challenging tasks. Approaching angry townspeople or doing something they don&apos;t like will take away Hearts, as well as injuring yourself through various means. When all your hearts are gone, you must restart at your last save. Hearts can also be regained by sleeping, eating, and certain other tasks. You earn money by kissing Underground residents (who only show up at certain times of the day), or by selling items found in the garbage. You can then use this money to buy various items that may help you get further into the game, or train tickets to travel to new areas.</story>

Cid was endowed special powers by its inventor, professor Werken, and finds itself charged with the task of saving the daughter of his. Action is represented in 3D while the gameplay is bidimensional in reality, à la Super Mario Galaxy. Levels present to Cid both enemies and puzzles — or, more exactly, obstacles of intellectual nature — like eluding the sights of security cams or pressing a requested button. A basic attack, plus around ten special moves, is how Cid can strike foes it comes into- each special attack is related with a gesture to be performed with the Wii Remote, with tutorials available to make the player familiarize themselves with.</story>

You&apos;ll be in control of both the driver and your partner, the warrior, whose job is to attack the other racers to make them fall over. Chariots are controlled by whipping horses and trying to balance an on-screen meter that keeps your chariot balanced while taking turns fast. There are four different race modes available; Training, which gives you the basics on how to play, Arcade, which is your standard race, Multiplayer, which lets you face off against three friends (or foes), and Career, which tracks your progress over a period of time. There are seven different environments and 19 tracks, all set throughout the Roman Empire. Each course is littered with obstacles, power ups, weapons, and special moves, designed to give you an edge in combat.</story>

    <story>Code Lyoko- Quest for Infinity is the second game based off of the popular French animated TV series Code Lyoko and it is presented as a 3D action platformer. It continues the original premise of the four high school students who discover a computer in an abandoned factory, holding a large virtual world plagued by the virus X.A.N.A., but many of the characters&apos; backgrounds are taken from later seasons in the series. Players take the role of one of the four heroes from the show, Ulrich, Odd, Yumi or Aelita, and fight across the virtual environment of Lyoko and the internet against the dangerous virus X.A.N.A. and his army of monsters. Levels are accessed from a main hub and players can switch between any of the characters at any time, but they share health and energy. The characters&apos; various weapons and abilities can be used to take them out, like Ulrich&apos;s swords, Odd&apos;s laser arrows or the ability to climb walls, or Yumi being the only one who can balance on thin ledges. Many of these skills are unlocked during the course of the game. X.A.N.A. on the Internet can be hunted down using the digital submarine Skidbladnir.</story>

    <story>A team from the Coast Guard boards a nameless Russian Whaler lost in a storm. Little do they know that a team of CIA operatives tried to do the same shortly before, all of them ending up dead. Within minutes, the entire Coast Guard team shares their fate, except one person, veteran USCG Tom Hansen. Now it&apos;s up to him to discover which kind of creatures wiped out his mates. Are there any survivors? What happened aboard this vessel? How does its recent visit to the Russian scientific drilling platform Star of Sakhalin fit in? This game is a typical console-style action adventure, similar to games like the Silent Hill series. Most of the time players will be viewing the action from a third person point of view, following the character around as he utilizes an array of weapons to dispose of a variety of enemies. Occasionally, a puzzle has to be solved or a cutscene (rendered with the game&apos;s own engine) must be witnessed. Additional insight can be gained by reading the various notes, letters and diaries that can be picked up every now and then.</story>

    <story>In Cold Winter, you play the role of Andrew Sterling, a former member of MI6, the British secret intelligence service. Andrew is caught preparing to assassinate someone in China, and is thrown into prison. There he faces torture and imminent execution. But a former friend from his MI6 days arranges to rescue him and offers him a job, having planned in advance to manipulate him so that he is unable to refuse. The first task seems fairly ordinary- to track down a weapons dealer who has been supplying terrorists. But soon Andrew&apos;s mission becomes more important, because he must deal with a sinister conspiracy that embraces the whole world. In the story, there is a secret society called the Greywings, which slowly began to form form after World War I. The organization dedicated itself to stopping nuclear weapons proliferation by any means. Their obsessive leader, John Grey, finally decided that this effort is hopeless. He set in motion a plan calculated to cause the nuclear war he had been trying to prevent for his whole life, reasoning that it is better to have the war under controlled conditions, because it would have happened sooner or later. He set the plan in motion by developing an information warfare program called Octopus, He sold Octopus widely on the black market, so that it would proliferate rapidly and many groups would fight to control it. Octopus is designed to fool its buyers, so each will believe the program lets them take over a wide variety of nuclear weapons control networks in various countries. But this is not so. For on the prearranged test date, Octopus will give remote control of several nuclear arsenals to the remaining members of the Greywings secret society -- not to the program&apos;s buyers, who will receive all the blame. It is Andrew Stirling who must stop the plan from working. He must track them down and follow them to &apos;Winterlong,&apos; a hidden bunker in the Arctic, where they have taken shelter. In this first-person shooter, you can collect over 20 weapons to kill your enemies. You can only carry two of them simultaneously, although it is also possible to use grenades. You can make weapons by combining items you find. For example, a fuel can, a bottle, and cloth combine to make a Molotov cocktail. A business card and some poison make a business card that is poisoned. You shouldn&apos;t worry about finding healing items, though, because you carry along an unlimited health pack. You need to remember to use this at the proper time, though, or of course you will still be killed. In combat, you can use various objects to help you. For example, you can throw pots at your enemies Large objects such as chairs, desks, and even wheeled carts can be pushed to block the enemy&apos;s path or to provide limited cover for yourself. The game has replay value, because to some extent, it is possible to take the roles of two other primary characters in the story. Replay value also comes from the fact that enemies react in unscripted, sensible ways. They move cleverly, respond to alarms, change posture, take cover, divide themselves, and work in groups. Depending on how quickly you are able to react, they are likely to send someone to get reinforcements, and they yell for help. Finally, there is a sense of realism. Perceptions become confused when the character is under stress. Graphical quality is good. Also, Cold Winter uses flashbacks to explain what has already happened, so there is a sense of knowing how the characters have reached their current places in the story.</story>

    <story>Colin McRae is no longer with Ford and Nicky Grist is no longer Colin’s co-driver. Things have moved on in the rally-driving world, as they have with this, the fourth title in the series. This time the player is in the vehicle of their choice. While the game features improved graphics over the older titles in the series the biggest improvement is the handling in the game, which is now based on real-world physics. Where the previous titles&apos; handling of the cars made use of one pivot point, the new physics engine has four pivot points, each wheel interacting independently of the others. There are four championships modes- 2WD, 4WD, Group B and Expert. 2WD is for beginners. 4WD is the next step up, offering an intermediate challenge. Group B features cars from the &apos;80s that were banned in 1986, as they were unrestricted and capable of extreme acceleration. And finally, Expert is for those that finish 4WD in advanced mode, upon which they are presented with Expert mode where one drives with cockpit view only, and with the highest damage setting. There are 8 national rallies in which to race, including USA, Australia, UK, Finland, Japan and Greece. There are also over 20 cars to unlock, including the Team Ford Transit van.</story>

It sports updated offensive and defensive A.I. and features Team Unity where the chemistry of the team combined with the captain&apos;s leadership qualities can combine to help their team in their performance and morale on the court.

    <story>In Conflict Desert Storm, you control a squad of four soldiers from either the British S.A.S or American Delta Force. The game is set during the first gulf war back in the early 1990s and has ideas borrowed from the book Bravo Two Zero and other real missions from the war. You are sent behind enemy lines to command a squad of elite commandos, set to destroy key strategic sites in Iraq. On your team is Bradley, the team leader, Conners, the heavy weapons man, Jones, the explosives and anti-tank expert, and Foley, the team sniper. Each soldier has different skills which can be built up by killing enemies. As your troops gain more experience, they will gain ranks and upgrade their skills. As their skills get better, the more effective they become at doing their job. For example, Foley will have more stable aiming or Jones will plant C4 faster as their skills increase. Conflict- Desert Storm is a first person/third person shooter, and each mode can be switched by the press of a button. You and your team are sent on missions with specific objectives, whether it be to infiltrate a base, destroy a SAM site, or assassinate an opposing general. You can both control your men individually and send them orders. Your men can be ordered to attack, retreat, follow, stay, and do many more things. If the mission requires it, you must drive tanks and jeeps around while your squad mans the guns on the vehicle. There is also the ability to play up to four player co-op with friends, with each person controlling a soldier in your squad. At the end of each mission, if you performed well, your men are awarded medals for their bravery. If you work hard enough, you may even be able to earn the Medal of Honor.</story>

    <story>This installment of the Conflict series occurs in many diverse regions of the World- in Conflict- Global Terror, Red Team spends the game fighting international terrorism. Rather than gung-ho desert tank warfare, or tense jungle ambush fighting, the game explores many non-army locations such as gas factories, cocaine production facilities and hotels. The combat is often up close and very personal, although most levels seem to mix up the killzone areas giving a wide variety that support combat over many varying ranges. The Missions vary quite a bit too. Some are frenetic - fast paced where the team are fighting for their lives, others can be played at a much slower pace if desired. The level design really adds to counter-terrorism gameplay. The Team are often busting seiges using C4 to blow holes in walls and smoke grenades to flush the bad guys out. The gadgets are useful and are frequently found to be helpful- thermal goggles let the player see through smoke, and Bradley&apos;s laser designator can mark key targets for gunship air strike. Claymore mines allow the team to protect their rear or even set up ambushes. The game is very flexible - adopting all playing styles. Players are free to run and gun, or play as a super-stealthy special forces team. Players can play as one character leading the team, or switch around between characters as they see fit. Ordering the team about and switching characters is quick and simple. It is even possible to give each member advanced orders - On my signal, Connors runs to the window, Bradley opens the door and Jones throws a grenade through the window . Ready....... GO!!! Conflict- Global Terror allows this kind of planning if the player wants to play that way. The co-op allows multiple players to take control of Red Team. There are 4 difficulty modes and a skill learning curve for beginners an veterans alike. There are over 30 weapons with individual stats and behaviours. Each has their own distinct advantages and disadvantages - pistols are sometimes a better choice than a light machine gun for example, so the game aims to be more flexible to different playing styles. The story unfolds throughout the missions and also in the cutscenes in between missions. The team really is made up of 4 distinct characters, with their own personal histories, lives and personalities.</story>

    <story>Conflict- Vietnam is the third game in Pivotal Games&apos; Conflict Series this time taking you further back in time to the bloody battleground of Vietnam. The game is set during the Tet offensive in the year 1968. You take over the role of four soldiers who aren&apos;t, contrary to previous games, elite S.A.S / Delta Force soldiers. In fact, they are normal American G.I. who are separated from their unit during battle and have to fight themselves through enemy territory with hordes of hostile Vietnamese. You can issue orders to every member of your squad or directly take control over one of them. In every mission you have one or more main and several bonus aims like destroying all tanks in the area or collecting Vietcong documents. For each achieved objective, killed soldier or destroyed vehicle your soldiers get experience points. Each soldier has different abilities (Sniper, Leader, Heavy Weapons, Medic) which can be improved with these points. To defuse one of the numerous booby traps it is necessary to have skills in that ability. The levels are set around the jungle and include underground Vietcong complexes or temples. You don&apos;t only meet enemies but also friendly persons like own soldiers or citizens with which you can talk and which sometimes give you bonus objectives. Furthermore, in some missions you can use stationary weapons like machine guns and drive jeeps or tanks. The console versions of Conflict- Vietnam feature a split-screen multiplayer co-op mode with up to four players (Xbox) resp. two players (PS2). The PC version doesn&apos;t have this feature.</story>

    <story>John Constantine is the name of the main character in the Hellblazer comic by Vertigo DC. This game is based on the movie Constantine, starring Keanu Reeves. The player assumes the role of Constantine, a mage/exorcist/demonslayer of the modern age. A man who fights Evil, but remains cynical and skeptical in the face of Good. He also smokes a lot. The game is played in third person perspective, switching to first person when the hero enters narrow spaces. Constantine&apos;s goal is to discover how and why Demons have managed to physically enter Earth, although the ancient laws forbid it. He utilizes a number of holy weapons and artifacts, from twin revolvers (dubbed the Witch&apos;s Curse) that shoot stones from the Holy Lands to Holy Water Bombs and the Cross Shotgun. Constantine can also utilize various kinds of offensive magic powered by the souls of slain demons. Often he will be obliged to travel to Hell, which resembles a perpetually ablaze and decaying version of our world, in order to bypass obstacles. Each level is linear and is played sequentially, following most of the story of the movie with a few sections added in or stretched out to allow for more action. Hidden cards in levels will unlock cutscene animatics, concept art, and interviews with the stars of the film.</story>

    <story>Counter Terrorist Special Force is an action game in which you are a part of an anti-terrorist force whose sole purpose is to strike where striking is needed and put end to evil plans to destroy/take over the world. The player controls two different heroes. Night Owl is an infiltrations expert, and very good at accurate shooting and jumping from planes, which some of the missions require him to do. Raptor on the other hand, is a weapons expert. He is also more than adequate in hand-to-hand combat. These two take turns in their own levels on their way to destroy the evil NEMESIS group and retrieve the stolen scientific plans. Levels are always very action-oriented even when playing as Night Owl and there are very little sneaking to do, as the main focus is on action. The levels range from your basic submarine factories to hidden missile silos and so on, with a few outdoor levels here and there, in which one usually can drive one of the vehicles (jeeps, hovercrafts, boats, etc). There are multiple weapons to choose from. From knives to huge rocket launchers and solid turrets. The physics system is also implemented in the game and most of the time there is a nice amount of stuff and dudes flying around as you make havoc with havok.</story>

    <story>Crash- Mind over Mutant continues the storyline of its predecessor, Crash of the Titans. The Titans from the previous game has broken free from Dr. Cortex&apos; control and has settled down on various places on the Wumpa Islands. But Cortex has teamed up with Nitrus Brio to develop a device which can control both the bandicoots and the Titans. Now Crash and his friends must find out where Cortex is hiding and stop him before he can act out his devious plan. Crash can use a light-powered attack to defeat smaller enemies, but for bigger enemies, a more high-powered attack is needed. Crash can also block and dodge attacks. Just like in Crash of the Titans, Crash can take control of the Titans which he encounters. But this time he can take the Titans with him and use them when he needs it. As Crash defeats more and more enemies, he can upgrade both his own attacks and the attacks of the Titans in his possession.</story>

    <story>Crash Bandicoot- The Wrath of Cortex is the first Crash Bandicoot game for a system other than the original PlayStation. The story is set some time after Warped- Dr. Cortex wants revenge after being defeated by Crash (again). For this purpose, he creates Crunch, a super-bandicoot who can destroy everything that crosses his way. So Crash needs to defeat Crunch (and in the end, Dr. Cortex). The game is a typical jump and run, with some other action passages, like air combat and a sequence where Crash is trapped inside a giant sphere rolling around in some sort of rollercoaster. All graphics are in 3D, and the sound is typical for cartoon games like this. The whole game is pretty straightforward in design, getting stuck on a puzzle is not really possible.</story>

The gameplay has the player explore levels, picking up power-ups to use against enemies as well as for the first time, use fighting combos such as punches and kicks against enemies. Players can also hijack 15 different enemy monsters to use against the others, each with their own special abilities and powers like fire breathing and earthquakes. Players can also interact with their world, climbing trees and swinging from ropes and even surf and skate throughout the levels. There is also co-op abilities where a friend can pop into the game at any point.

Instead of simply flying and running around, the chickens feature a lot of animated motion sequences that make them seem almost alive. The surroundings are completely generated in 3D and feature a lot of crazy objects and scenes such as two hedgehogs playing cards (one is actually wearing dark sunglasses!). The chickens try to hide in every conceivable place on screen, be it an old oven or in an outdoor toilet. They hide in wheat fields and even dress up as a sunflower in order to escape the player&apos;s dreadful gun. All these features make it more difficult for the player to get all the chickens. The actual shooting controls remain the same as in previous Moorhuhn games- the player aims with the mouse, shoots by clicking the left mouse button and reloads by clicking the right mouse button.</story>

    <story>Crazy Taxi is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can&apos;t be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short. In the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks- a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly. Next to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B or A, with S for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).</story>

As well as featuring twenty-five story-based missions, Crime Life also gives the player the freedom to explore the game world and to experience mini-missions that include fighting whilst drunk and taking control of rival turf.</story>

    <story>The sequel to Crimson Sea, this game follows the story of Sho, the protagonist of the first game. In the distant future, a solar system called Theophilus is once again attacked by a mysterious alien race, called the menace. The brave bounty hunter Sho, who wields a special sword which he can also use as a gun, is determined to put an end to the invasion. During his adventure he encounters a girl named Feanay, who will help him on his journey. In this action adventure game, you control both Sho and Feanay. Some of the missions can be accessed by both characters, while some are available only to one of them. Feanay uses energy pistols and dual laser swords as weapons. Both Sho and Feanay use the so called neo-psionics, which are the magic spells of the game. There are also slight role-playing elements in the game. Defeated enemies drop special items that can be later used to upgrade your weapons. You also gain set amounts of experience points after missions.</story>

    <story>Crimson Tears is set in the near-future Tokyo, where an unknown entity has attacked and it&apos;s your job as a the main character to save the day. The game is a hack&apos;n&apos;slash affair in which three people enter the dungeon to kill monsters and loot the... loot. Gameplay is very much like Nethack or Chocobo&apos;s Mysterious Dungeon as you delve deeper into the lair, leveling up, collecting stuff and occasionally returning to town and selling the excess.

    <story>Set in Qing dynasty of 19th Century China, this adaptation of the film of the same name follows the path of the characters Jen, Yu Shu Lien and Li Mu Bai. When warrior Li decides to retire from fighting, he gives his famous jade sword, The Green Destiny, to a nobleman. The weapon is stolen shortly afterwards, and he has to hunt down the thief with his friend Yu Shu Lien, while the sassy nobleman&apos;s daughter Jen keeps crossing their path. The epic story has been split up in three parts, one for each character. The game mimics the film&apos;s famous martial arts, based on the Wudan fighting style, with a set of basic attacks, attack combos and special moves, combined with defensive actions such as basic blocking, combo blocking and evasion. While fighting, the characters learn new moves, collect items and earn rewards. Skills are improved according to your fighting style. Using specific attacks (e.g. unarmed) boosts the related skills, which can be leveled up. There are different flavours of weapons to be collected, from axes to swords, spears and sabers, and even exotic variants such as falchion, firangi or gloive. New ones can be acquired during battle, but enemies can pick them up as well.</story>

    <story>Crusty Demons is an extreme sports game based on the real-life stunt troupe of the same name. Motorized vehicles such as motorcycles and cars are used in performing tricks on ramps, half-pipes and over open areas. Large environments such as trailer parks and international cities like New York and Tokyo are available for the player to explore, do tricks and race. The story of the videogame has the Crusty Demons meeting the Devil and agreeing to sign over their souls if given immortality. However, the Crusty Demons want to renege on the deal once they find out that they can still feel pain when fatally injured. The Devil, not without mercy, agree to offer back their souls on the condition that the Crusty Demons follow his every order and fulfill his demands for whatever stunt he asks of them. Whenever a stunt goes fatally wrong, the games rag doll engine rewards the player with a graphic simulation of the collision or bail. This is also conjoined with the appropriate blood splatter on the screen as well as x-rays that show whichever bones have broken. Unlockables consist of pictures of babes.</story>

    <story>You&apos;ll have 5 bloody cases to solve as you play a rookie investigator with the Las Vegas crime lab. The first four ultimately connect together towards solving the 5th. Your co-workers are characters from the CSI television series and voice acting is done by the real actors and actresses from the show. Choose one of 3 levels of difficulty depending upon how familiar you are with the tv shows (and computer gaming in general). Those modes affect how much interactive help you receive inside the game - not from your co-workers, but by way of hotspots and evidence analysis. The game features a tutorial to help with the interface, which is point and click. Asking your partner for hints detracts points. At the end of each case, Gil Grissom (the boss) will rate your performance as either a rookie, investigator or master. Your objective is to gather enough evidence and information to arrest the culprit(s) and achieve as close to a 100% rating as possible (master). This will unlock special features at the end of each case. Unlike the previous games, the graphics are 3D allowing you a more full view of your environment. Like the earlier games, however, there is still limited exploration of the world around you. The 3D system does provide the ability to move evidence objects in different angles which helps to locate all available fingerprints and other possible evidence.</story>

When a player lands on another player&apos;s monster, he/she can challenge it to a battle in an attempt to take over the territory. If the attacker wins, he/she gets the space on the board and additional mana. There are more than sixteen different game boards, each with different rules and layouts (such as the maximum number on dice rolls, the elements on the board, etc.)</story>

For many, the creation of the Virtuaroids (VR) began a new age as the 49-foot mechanical giants gained the attention of everyone and anyone nearby. Noticing this, business makers used the opportunity to create a new form of entertainment upon the surface of Mars. Known as Limited War, the performances drew crowds the universe over. It wasn&apos;t until corporate greed appeared once more that things began to fall out of control. Those in power began to fight each other for a stake in the new events, leading to internal fighting and crime. A special investigations unit was formed, in hopes it would eliminate such crime and bring order back. They are known as &apos;MARZ&apos;, and as a member of that team you must use your new found position to your advantage. In each mission, you will control your own VR and must defend or attack a number of key locations and other VR units. Over time you will gain new additions to the machines armour and weapons which will aid you in later missions. You&apos;ll also unlock bigger and more powerful VR&apos;s as well.</story>

Because of global warming, the rise of the ocean level has made many countries disappear. Fortunately, extreme weather patterns have emerged and wind has become an endless resource with enormous speeds. Mankind has adapted and now uses the powerful wind as a source for transportation, constructing vehicles to make use of it. Additionally, The International Racing League is organized, a racing event where speed is determined by the control of wind. This is where you come in. Cyclone Circus is a racer where you can compete against 9 computer players or against another player in dual screen mode. The cars sport an exotic and futuristic design, and each car has a plasma sail that you have to use as good as you can. Turning the wind to your advantage, you can pick up numerous bonuses and even power-ups that will catapult you ahead of your opponents. Each level has a very specific setting and atmosphere, and contains a number of special jump sites and bonus areas where you can do special tricks to score more points. There are ten characters, nine courses with shortcuts, and eight trick levels based on ramps and fly routes.</story>

The PS2 version of the game has 30 tracks (around 20 of which are famous/original) by artists including Misteeq, Run D.M.C, Liberty X, Sugababes, Room 5, Sophie Ellis Bextor, Chic, The Trammps, 5ive, Junior Senior, Las Ketchup and DJ Sammy. There are initially three difficulty levels, and the player can either practise one song at a time (in Jukebox mode) or enter the Dance-UK Championship, winning which will unlock a &apos;Dance Recorder&apos; mode in which players can record their own dance routines. In multiplayer up to 8 players can compete in succession or 2 players can compete head-to-head. A karaoke mode is also provided for use with a wireless microphone (sold separately) whilst &apos;Aerobic&apos; Mode calculates the number of calories you&apos;ve burnt during play.</story>

    <story>Dance-UK- eXtra Trax follows in the wake of Dance-UK and it&apos;s gameplay is virtually identical in every respect. It too takes the standard &apos;bemani&apos; formula - arrows appear rhythmically on screen and the player must hit the corresponding button (on either a dance mat peripheral or the standard controller) in time with these arrows and the music. Points are awarded for accuracy with extras for making certain &apos;combos&apos; (mini-routines within a song which are deemed especially difficult or long). The original game PS1 version of the game had twenty tracks, this game has just twelve. It can be played in either Aerobic mode, which calculates but does not record the number of calories you&apos;ve burnt during play, or Dance mode. Dance mode can be played in head-to-head, multiplayer or jukebox modes and has four three difficulty levels, beginner, easy, medium and expert. Head to head requires two controllers while the other two require just the one. In all modes the player can either select the track they wish to dance to or let the game select a random track, jukebox mode also has a dance recorder function, which does not have to be unlocked as it did in Dance-UK, but when the player dances to the playback the score is not recorded in the high score table. Though the game is intended to be used with a dance mat it can be played using a standard controller. There is an optional karaoke feature which shows the words of the song while the player is dancing, the words do not show during the dance recording or playback features. </story>

    <story>Disney Channel Edition, only released in the United States, is another dancing game of the Dance Dance Revolution series from Konami. This time the game aims especially for all those, who are into the Disney Channel series and can’t get enough of idols like Hannah Montana, Cheetah Girls and so on. The game features music and characters from series like High School Musical, Hannah Montana, The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, Cheetah Girls and more. Included are 40 songs and a new game mode called “Magic Mode”, where the player can compete against characters from the Disney Channel to unlock additional character outfits. In this mode you can fill up a combo meter to apply a handicap to the other player, which makes it then harder to hit the steps right.</story>

    <story>As with other Dance Dance Revolution games, this is meant to be played on a dance mat or platform controller. As the song plays, arrows scroll up the screen in time with the music and you score points by stepping on the corresponding arrow on the mat as they reach the top. Freeze arrows have long trails; on these you must step and hold your foot down for the duration of the arrow, using your other foot to make other steps in the meantime. Your score depends on your timing. When you step with good timing, your dance meter rises; when you miss, it falls. If your dance meter drops to empty, you fail. Dance Master mode presents you with a series of challenges to earn points to unlock songs, courses (where you play a sequence of songs nonstop), special modes, and optional graphic textures. You can use an EyeToy USB camera to display the player(s) dancing on the screen instead of the normal backgrounds. Hands and Feet mode uses the camera to add hand waving to the gameplay. Workout mode that tracks your calories burned for players who use DDR in their exercise regimen. You can play with one or two players, or with other players in online play. A demo of Karaoke Revolution is included.</story>

    <story>Slightly varied in technology and musical content from the Japanese arcade game and home port of the same name as well as the parallel European release Dancing Stage SuperNova 2, this game delivers rhythmic play that has become well-established over the course of the series&apos; dynasty -- to gloss generally, players are rated on how effectively they deliver input in response to a continuously-scrolling list of controller direction instructions. When the screen tells players that they&apos;re about to be called upon to hit the left button as its corresponding glyph ascends up the screen, they must try to match it precisely at the moment of the glyph&apos;s overlap with a target area at the top of the screen. DDR games being what they are, this is all synchronized to player-selected electro-pop music with music video or animated dancing avatar sideshows, and of course is intended for play with the series&apos; trademark control device, a giant four-way directional pad laid on the floor to be rhythmically walked upon. (Two can be used simultaneously for two players or one who boasts some simply spectacular dance moves.) After the attainment of various in-game achievements have granted the players sufficient points to buy an initially-locked handful in the in-game store, this game offers up 72 different songs (some in a fragmentary form) in a variety of styles from Konami&apos;s J-pop stable as well as regionalised tunes from recognized Western artists. In addition to the standard pick three songs and see how high a cumulative score you can rack up, supposing you don&apos;t get prematurely booted due to low performance game mode, the game offers variant play types- hyper master mode (taking on extra tasks in order to earn achievements such as Supportive Modules to make things easier and Challenge Modules to make them tougher), workout mode (to help calculate calories burned and long-term exercise routines), advanced modes (initial options include battle -- competitive vs. the computer or a human player -- or course, running through a selected playlist... and eventually unlocking survival mode, endless mode, and the combo challenge mode), training mode (to help learn the steps to a particular song), and edit mode (for custom programming of your own choreographed dance steps!)</story>

    <story>A rhythm action game focusing on the use of a dance mat to successfully complete a dance pattern of arrows scrolling up the screen in time to music. The object of the game is to get as many arrows in the right order and at the right time to get a high score. The unique selling point of Dance Factory is that it will automatically create a dance pattern based on any music CD inserted into the PS2 console. Dance Factory contains six different single-player game modes which are all variations around the main game mechanic which is to match patterns moving up the screen with the button presses or foot taps of the user all in time with a music track. Along with the basic game mode, there is an endurance mode which plays through an entire CDs worth of songs, a fitness mode which counts calories and a record mode that lets you create your own dance. There is also a &apos;creature&apos; mode that makes a computer animated character dance along with the music on screen and an EyeToy mode that adds hand icons to the dance patterns that the player&apos;s onscreen camera image must hit in time to the music. Dance Factory also includes a multiplayer mode that allows two players to dance simultaneously in a head to head battle or cooperatively to compete for higher scores. Multiplayer also features a tournament mode where up to 16 players can compete in a series of head to head battles to pick an eventual winner.</story>

    <story>Dance Fest takes the standard &apos;bemani&apos; formula - arrows appear rhythmically on screen and the player must hit the corresponding button (on either a dance mat peripheral or the standard controller) in time with these arrows and the music. Points are awarded for accuracy with bonus multipliers awarded for making certain &apos;combos&apos; (mini-routines within a song which are deemed especially difficult or long). This is a game for one or two players with three difficulty settings, easy, hard and medium. The player selects their difficulty level and their track and then attempts to score points by hitting the correct buttons in sequence. During the song the player is treated to an distant view of an animated disco dancer on a stage and illuminated with coloured lights. Once the track is over the player can enter their name, assuming they have achieved a high score. The game holds eight scores for each of the three difficulty levels but no scores are recorded for Workout and Recorder modes. The game has a workout mode in which the player first enters their weight, in kilograms, and then selects a track. Gameplay here is basically the same as the main game but instead of points the game calculates the number of calories burned. There is no difficulty setting for this game mode and the arrows come thick and fast. The Recorder option allows the player to create and save their own dance, there is no high score for this and while the dance moves are preserved from one game to the next only one routine can be saved.

    <story>Dark Angel- Vampire Apocalypse is a 3D action-role-playing game set in the seventeenth century, where you play as Anna, a mysterious woman who must protect a village against the armies of the Shadow Lord, which are made up of vampires and other assorted creatures. Gameplay is much like the Diablo series where you are assigned a quest in one of three villages, then accomplish it in one of three dungeons or one of three battlefields battling randomly-generated groups of monsters that drop random equipment based on a drop-rate formula. You improve your character through a slow progression of leveling up from experience points and finding better equipment or purchasing it from villagers. Each mission you accomplish improves the economy, research or military stats of the village you are doing it for, which is what determines which items they have available for purchase. There are three basic monster-types- Undead, Forgotten and Mutants. There are seven basic types of melee weapons. Two each do extra damage to each type of monster and the final does extra damage to groups. There are also four kinds of guns and a variety of bombs. The object of the game is make Anna into an all-powerful warrior through battling and questing before a year is up and the Shadow Lord attacks. This takes upward of 100 hours of game time. At this point, she must defeat the Shadow Lord for good.</story>

    <story>400 Years ago, a war between the Eastern Continent and the Western Wizard Army destroyed the world as a great power was unleashed. Time has passed and in present day, the power-hungry General Flag has organized a ritual to awaken this power once more- the Dark Genie. Barely controlled by a spell, the Dark Genie once again breaks the world, beginning with the village of Norune. The only survivor of Norune is a boy named Toan, son of the great hero Ada. As Toan surveys the destruction, the Spirit King appears and tells him that all is not lost; pieces of the world, including buildings and people, have been sealed away in protective Atla spheres. Using a magic glove called the Atlamillia, Toan must resurrect the world and find the powers necessary to defeat the Dark Genie. Dark Cloud is an action-RPG title, often compared to Soul Blazer, played from the 3rd person perspective. Toan must enter randomly generated dungeons where he will battle monsters and recover Atla spheres. Toan battles with a sword, which can be slashed directly in front of him or powered up for a stronger blow. During his travels, Toan encounters other characters who will offer to aid him and can be switched to during dungeons, with individual statistics and weapons. Items are also found and shared among the party, including restorative items, attack items and general power-ups. Each character has a thirst meter, which much be replenished or health will start to drain. Should a character lose all their health, they will fall in battle and be returned to town unless Stand-In powder is used, in which case that character is unavailable and control passes to another. Toan is the only character able to collect Atla spheres which contain different items needed to restore the villages destroyed by the Dark Genie. Rebuilding is done outside the dungeon in a designated village area. Buildings can be placed down, rotated and moved as need be. They can also be upgraded with additional furniture and people (usually the owners of the building). As the dungeons are conquered and the area becomes more lifelike, treasure chests start appearing around the town and villagers often become friendlier. Some villagers have additional requests, such as being placed facing the east, for the placement of their homes. Each character in Toan&apos;s party uses a unique weapon, but several different types of weapon under each category can be collected. As weapons are used, they gain Absorption (Abs). These Abs points are used as &amp;quot;experience&amp;quot; for the weapon and can upgrade the weapon&apos;s abilities. Each weapon features a number of &amp;quot;slots&amp;quot; to which power-up items can be attached, any items attached to slots will be absorbed when the weapon is upgraded. Each weapon has certain attributes which must be improved in order to &amp;quot;build up&amp;quot; to a different type of weapon. Additionally, any weapon reaching level 5 can be broken into a Synthsphere, an item containing 60% of its abilities, which can then be attached to slots on different weapons. In this manner, weapons can always be upgraded or used in the improvement of another weapon throughout the game. The game also features certain sequences where buttons must be pressed in the correct order and correct timing in order to progress.</story>

    <story>The Darkwatch is an ancient organization hell-bent on destroying evil in the world. They have just captured the vampire lord Lazarus and are transporting him back to headquarters for questioning, when an outlaw tries to rob the train and instead of finding riches releases Lazarus from his hold, but not before the outlaw is bitten by the vampire lord. As Jericho Cross, the former outlaw and now the newest member of the Darkwatch, you must find and kill Lazarus, lest you turn into a full-blown vampire yourself. Darkwatch is a first-person shooter set in the Wild West with supernatural beings. Fight your way through reapers, undead riflemen, banshees and other creatures using Darkwatch weaponry that doubles as melee weapons, such as a revolver, two-fisted pistols, a crossbow (with dynamite attached to the bolts) and a Rail Rocket. You will also find dynamite along the way to throw at the enemy and to destroy barricades. Along with conventional weapons, Cross will acquire vampire powers of good or evil nature that you must choose in the story. If you decide to be good, then you receive powers such as Silver Bullet that increases your shots with holy fire or Vindicator that calls down chain lightning on your enemies. If you choose to be evil, you will receive Blood Frenzy that makes melee attacks supernaturally powerful and Soul Stealer, which sucks the very souls from distant enemies. Regardless of good or evil, you will always have Blood Shield (protection from losing health), Vampire Jump (for those hard to reach areas) and Blood Vision (causes enemies, weapons and other important objects to glow). With every creature killed, there will be at least one Blood Cloud and sometimes more to replenish your health and restore your Vampire Powers. In single player you can choose from story mode (follow the story of Jericho Cross one chapter at a time) or Gunslinger mode (replay any level unlocked in story mode as either evil or good). At the end of the level, you see your number of kills and accuracy percentage, which, if it is good enough, will unlock some movies and concept art. Play on-line over Xbox Live with up to 16 players or up to 4 people in split-screen mode. Multiplayer matches include Death Match, Team Death Match, Capture the Flag, Soul Hunter (fight to collect Blood Clouds and be the first to fill your Blood Bar) and Team Soul Hunter. You can adjust the settings for each match regarding the game type, map in which you wish to play, total time play, score limit and kill limit. In the main menu, you can choose Extras to view concept art unlocked from playing Gunslinger Mode, movies from Story Mode and your statistics from Story Mode and Gunslinger Mode.</story>

    <story>Endorsed by the then England and Manchester United captain and international superstar, David Beckham Soccer is the last of Rage long tradition in developing soccer games. It includes both national and club teams (from England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain), plus the ability to create custom teams, with details ranging from the usual name, strips and colours to the stadium. Other than Beckham himself, no player is licensed (likeness is preserved, but names are replaced with phonetic equivalents, such as “Owin” or “Zanetee”), but the editor also allows the player to customize each player and team. Game modes include friendly, club season, several international cups (including the defunct Home Championship), Classic Matches (some featuring the highlights of Beckham&apos;s career, others just classic matches), Beat Brazil, where the player starts with France, and tries to beat Brazil with a progressively weaker team, Survival, where the player face top international teams, with goals against carrying over, until the player loses a match, and Train With Beckham, a series of drill minigames destined to teach the basics of the game and unlock “secrets”. Gameplay is similar to previous titles developed by the company (most notably Microsoft Football 2000 and UEFA Striker), and not unlike Beckham, has its strong point during dead ball situations, where the player can choose either to use a set play to get the defense offguard, or take a direct shot or swerving pass using the traditional arrow indicator. In terms of options, the game doesn’t offer much to tweak, only bookings, offsides, injuries, match length and the decider (simple or golden goal overtime and penalty shootout)</story>

With a focus on realism the game first requires the player to go through a tutorial guided by David, where the different moves (52 in total) are explained. While fighting, it is not possible to perform each of these moves at will. The gameplay consists of fast-paced consecutive sequences where three different moves are suggested. The player has to select a move and perform it with a combination of keys or buttons. Based on the situation and the timing, it is then executed. Next to the tutorial, three games modes are available- Quick Play, Championship and Career. There are five different dojos to compete with a traditional, regional, national and international setting, and a temple. Nine judokas are available, of which David Douillet is the only real sportsman, with the character bearing his likeness.</story>

    <story>Dawn of Mana (Seiken Densetsu 4) is a game in the World of Mana / Seiken Densetsu series by Square Enix. The story takes place shortly before Sword of Mana and as an action game with exploration elements the gameplay involves traversing levels full of challenges including feats of dexterity, solving puzzles, and defeating monsters in various ways. Unlike the other games in the series, it cannot be considered an RPG. Gameplay is separated by cut-scenes that depict the plot and story using the characters and environments, voice-overs, narration, and pictures. The player controls the main character, Keldy, who wields a sword for attacking, a whip for grabbing and throwing, and pellets for ranged attacks. Unlike the other Mana games there are no shops where equipment or new items can be bought - there are only music tracks and movie clips. Keldy can only enhance his combat performance with certain ribbons and special arrows. Enhancements come through emblems, by meeting certain requirements, left behind by enemies or bought at the Challenge Arena shop. They usually boost the character&apos;s basic abilities. Magic is also available through seven different spells. The story is divided into eight chapters and the game also sports a Challenge Arena mode where players need to complete 32 separate challenges, optionally with the help of a pet, bought in shops or obtained through eggs discovered in the game. The game uses the Havok physics system, allowing Keldy to use his whip on almost any part of the environment. This is further encouraged through the game&apos;s Mono system, where objects hit in the surroundings of enemies induces panic, also making available boost medals.</story>

    <story>Dead To Rights is an action-game, straight out. You play as Jack Slate, a police officer in Grant City. On a routine call, you find a dead body; the body is your father. Later framed, Jack becomes a fugitive, on the run from the law. Your quest will take you to various places, from strip joints and hotels, to office complexes, and even prison... as an inmate. Dead To Rights is an action game in every sense of the word. When fighting, you have the opportunity to perform various moves, such as grabbing an enemy from behind and using him as a human shield, to tossing a fire extinguisher and shooting it, causing a huge explosion. When against an enemy and you have no gun drawn, you can perform &amp;quot;disarm&amp;quot; moves, which causes your character to steal the enemy&apos;s gun, then performing some sort of finishes, such as a neck breaker. Initially, only a few disarm moves are available, but more can be unlocked as your progress. A unique addition in this game allows you to control Jack&apos;s best friend, and partner, Shadow, his K-9 dog. Using Shadow, you can kill enemies from far away, and retrieve their gun in Shadow&apos;s jaws. Dead To Rights features adrenaline combat, which is similar to that of &amp;quot;Bullet-Time&amp;quot; from Max Payne. You can perform slow-motion dives and spins, giving you an advantage, as long as your adrenaline holds out.</story>

The main focus of the game is on Jack taking down crime after the kidnapping of a judge. He discovers a city full of corruption and betrayal. Included is a 360 degree fighting system. Returning to the game is the super slow motion that was originally employed in Max Payne games and The Matrix movie. You can now use Shadow to attack enemies in real-time while you beat down on other enemies. If his stamina bar is high enough, Slate&apos;s K9 will kill the enemy, and if he is tired, he&apos;ll work to keep any enemy away with vicious bites. This game includes a lot of weapons including rocket launchers, grenades, and Molotov cocktails. The minigames are not essential to the game, whereas they were in the original game.

    <story>In this Tekken spin-off, you control assassin Nina Williams as she fights to take down terrorist organization/evil corporation Kometa. She infiltrated a luxury cruise ship, Amphitrite, as a fighter in an illegal fighting tournament. The mission was to find out more about this organization, and two other CIA operatives were sent onboard the cruiser. Nina was but a support member of the team, not to take anything in her own hands unless her colleagues fail. Yet, when she is taken captive, and receives the news of mission failed, she&apos;s about to take matters into her own hands, and do what she&apos;s trained to do... sweep off the decks. Nina must make her way through a large cruise ship, finding keys and scanning prints to gain access to more areas while using stealth to avoid the guards. When stealth fails, the game&apos;s more unique aspects come into play. Although game uses 3rd-person perspective, on certain occasions it switches to 1st-person view such as when using a sniper rifle, swimming underwater, or crawling the ducts. Death by Degrees uses analog sticks to perform the attacks. The left stick moves Nina, and make her dodge when tapped instead of moved gradually, while the right stick makes her attack in whatever direction it is tapped, so attacks can be executed in any direction. Blocks are executed by holding the right stick toward the enemy at the precise moment of attack. In fights, you can disable enemies quickly with precisely-aimed bone-breaking maneuvers. When executed correctly, the game switches to an x-ray views to bone crushing a bit more enhanced then it was done in Rogue Ops. You can lock camera over your shoulder in most of the areas, which then allows you to freely rotate the camera while Nina is constantly in her running mode. Beside martial arts, she can use variety of melee weapons like knives, batons, swords, and such, as well as pistols, machine guns, and other firearms. As you defeat opponents, you gain points which serves you to upgrade already rich plethora of moves and attacks.</story>

    <story>Def Jam- Fight for NY is the sequel to the out-of-left-field Def Jam- Vendetta. The game opens with the person you beat in the previous game, D-Mobb, being arrested. As the police are driving, an SUV comes out of nowhere and smashes into the car, setting D-Mobb free. After a quick cutscene, it turns out the person who was driving the SUV was you, and you have now joined D-Mobb&apos;s crew. Fight for NY&apos;s story mode takes you through the ranks, and pits you against tougher and tougher fighters. You start off in D-Mobb&apos;s crew as a nobody, and will have to work your way up, fighting off people from other crews, including D-Mobb&apos;s rival, Crow. You&apos;ll take part mostly in one-on-one brawls, with the odd team match and free for all thrown in. To aid you in fighting, you can use the environment to hurt your enemy. You can smash people into wooden/cement walls, fences, or just whack them off of a wooden pillar. Speakers, soda machines, garbage cans... All there to harm your enemy (or you). Some objects are interactive, such as flood lights, which will change the lighting of the ring once someone&apos;s been thrown into them. You have weapons at your disposal, usually a metal pipe, pool cue and broken bottle. The crowd also gets into the action, which can be good or bad for you. You can throw an enemy into a crowd and have them push him towards you; you can knock a stunned enemy into the crowd, and they will hold him down, giving you free shots; or you can throw an opponent into a part of the crowd holding a weapon, and they&apos;ll use the weapon against him. There are five fighting styles available to you. There is Street Fighting, which focuses on punches; Kickboxing, which focuses on kick attacks; Martial Arts, which focuses on speed, running, and acrobatic attacks; Wrestling, which focuses on standard wrestling moves, like bodyslams; and Submissions, which focus on wearing down a specific part of the enemy until that limb is damaged enough to earn a submission. In addition to Story mode, you have Battle mode, which allows you to play with up to four players in different types of matches. Fight for NY has lots of unlockables. Earning reward points from Battle matches, you can purchase new fighters or venues to fight in.</story>

    <story>Defender is an updated version of the classic arcade game of the same name. The Manti bugs have invaded earth and the remaining human survivors now live in colonies throughout the solar system. As more swarms of Manti arrive, even the colonies are now in danger of being wiped out. You&apos;ve been enlisted to help save the remaining colonists and destroy the Manti bugs! There are a total of six different ships to fly, each with its own flight characteristics and special weapons. Weapon and shield power-ups can also be found throughout the various missions. As in the original version of Defender, the Manti will try to capture any humans they can find to change them into mutants to increase their attack force. To increase chances of success you will need to rescue captured humans before this happens and bring them to a safe landing zone. Saving colonists will also earn you some credits, which can later be used to buy improved weapons or shields for you ship. Also included are several video extras detailing the historical perspective of and the making of Defender.</story>

    <story>Part of the Simple 2000 series of games. Tamsoft delivers the tale of a Riho; a Bikini model who becomes a giant after being stung by some sort of alien jellyfish. You then are given the task of measuring her dimensions, chasing and then bringing her back down to size. You take on the role of a Helicopter, Jet and Tank while Riho rampages around Japan causing destruction and mayhem. Gameplay varies from measuring Riho, chasing her down a highway and protecting her sleeping form from alien squids while flying over the ocean. As this is a Simple 2000 game, Demolition Girl is short and simple. The controls for each vehicle are similar and the graphical style is more or less consistent with other Tamsoft titles in the Simple 2000 series.</story>

    <story>In feudal Japan, different clans are waging wars against each other. All of a sudden, demons spawn around the country and add to the chaos. In Demon Chaos, the player takes control of Inugami, the embodiment of the god of war, to cleanse the lands of the demons. This title is a 3rd person hack and slay action game. Inugami can use a combination of various attacks to get rid of the demon hordes, of which there are plenty in Demon Chaos. In most missions, there are friendly armies fighting along side the protagonist that have to be protected. The player can give the armies a rudimentary follow command and create various pillars, which can for example heal surrounding units. Inugami&apos;s health can be restored by getting close to Aoi Yasaka, a priestess that accompanies him throughout the player&apos;s journey. During the fight, a spirit gauge can be charged to unleash special attacks - enemies occasionally drop items to restore the spirit energy. After each mission, new weapons are unlocked with gradually improving properties.</story>

    <story>Greetings earthlings! I, Cryptosporidium 137 of the Furon Empire, happened upon your planet on the way back from destroying the martians. Due to some experiments with atomic weaponry, we lack genitalia and the quality of our clones has degraded. Since you pathetic humans all carry Furon DNA in your genetic code, I have been instructed to collect fresh samples. Survival is not an option, but you should be honoured to support the legacy of the Furon Empire! Destroy All Humans! is a humorous action game with winks to the era of the goofy fifties&apos; sci-fi movies. Crypto can hypnotize and scan people, and lift objects using psychokinesis. He can also control humans using the Hypno Blast to impose his commands. Extracted DNA can be exchanged in your mothership for new weapons and ability upgrades. Furon weaponry includes a Zap-o-Matic, disintegrator ray, abducto beam, quantum deconstructor and even the famous anal probe. Not to be overpowered, you have to disguise yourself using the Holobob. There are different alert levels, similar to the Grand Theft Auto games and if you are not careful, you will be hunted down by the police, military or the government. You are constantly in contact with the mothership, where you can purchase upgrades, save the game and apply for new missions. Crypto does not have to run all the time, he can also use his flying saucer to abduct humans or animals, cause havoc or face bigger threats. Next to the story-based missions, you will also be instructed to collect specific samples or kill a certain amount of humans in a race against time.</story>

    <story>Our hero, Crypto 137, is back. Earth is under attack again in another alien invasion. The setting is now the &apos;60s. You go around hunting Humans with your Zap-o-Matic, Ray Gun, or a new weapon. Occasionally there are probing missions where you can hypnotize a Human to do something to carry out your plans for the Furion Planet. There are also missions where you trick humans into being abducted by your ship. Crypto also has new weapons- The Dislocator, a gun that shoots purple discs and grabs anything (including tanks), and beats them up. There&apos;s also a gun that can bring down meteor strikes... and another gun is called Gastro, which is a hologram on a hover-ship that helps out Crypto. The side quests have fleshed-out stories now; in addition, there are cult missions where you convince humans to worship an Alien God. A Co-op mode has also been added. The entire game can be played through on a split-screen and the second player can join in or out of the action at any time through the pause menu.</story>

    <story>Sometime during the 2050s, the world is a dangerous place as terrorists, drug czars, and outlaw states rule, using violence and subterfuge as tools in their push for global conquest. A deadly virus dubbed gray death is running rampant throughout the world and the only known cure is a chemical known as Ambrosia manufactured by the VersaLife corporation. However Ambrosia supplies are scarce and world governments, particularly the United States, carefully monitor and control who receives this cure. As protest against these events, French terrorist organization Silhouette bombs the historic symbol of friendship between French and American people, The Statue of Liberty. In response to this attack, the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) organization is formed. Building a headquarters underground at Liberty Island, it&apos;s mission is to attack terrorism and maintain peace around the world. JC Denton is a nano-enhanced agent who has been primed for UNATCO service. While JC&apos;s brother Paul is already an active agent, JC is beginning his first day of service when the National Secessionist Forces (NSF) suddenly raid a supply of Ambrosia at UNATCO headquarters. Deus Ex is a dark cyberpunk RPG in which the player assumes the role of JC Denton, UNATCO anti-terrorist agent. Pitted against an elaborate global conspiracy, he must interact with characters, pick up weapons and complete objectives. While DC is essentially fixed within the mission-framework of the game, he can be customized with different skills in areas such as weapons, technical skills and physical prowess. The game world is somewhat expansive and fairly open to accommodate different approaches to solving the same problems, depending on he player&apos;s preferred style of play. JC can also augment himself using nanotech to enhance or add extra abilities. The game interface is typical of a first person RPG/action-adventure game. The world is rendered in first-person 3D and camera segues are sometimes interspersed to transition the gameplay or expose new story elements. Combat takes place in the same interface, mostly in the style of a first person shooter. Deus Ex blends shooter type gameplay with touches of RPG character development, stealth and multiple solutions to many puzzles.</story>

    <story>Devil Kings is in the same vein as the Dynasty Warriors series. Whereas in Dynasty Warriors, however, Koei focuses on ancient Chinese history, Devil Kings focuses more on feudal Japan, but with a fictional setting with the ability to use modern day weapons such as chain guns and shotguns as well as fighting legendary and fictional characters from the past. The story takes place as the Devil King, a king possessed by the soul of the Devil, has unleashed an unholy army on the world to bend it to his will as the player must stop him along with many of his minions including his wife Lady Butterfly, his general the Red Minotaur, as well as loyal assassins Scorpio and Venus. The gameplay is more arcade hack-and-slash style, with the ability of using magic spells to wipe out entire waves of enemies and as mentioned before, the ability to use modern day weapons along with historical weapons such as spears, swords among others. There are six playable characters to use as well, each with their own story told in CG and anime cutscenes as well as two modes of play, Conquest (the main story of the game) and Free Mode (where players can play in any unlocked stage they have completed).</story>

    <story>John McClane is back. Many years have passed since his work in New York, and he now works for the Century City Police Department (CCPD) in Los Angeles. You are in John&apos;s shoes as he must face a new threat. Piet Gruber, the son of Hans Gruber and McClane&apos;s old enemy, is up to no good at the Townsend Art Museum. He has stolen valuable art and kidnapped John&apos;s now adult daughter and fellow CCPD police officer, Lucy. This game is a First Person Shooter, but it also adds two features- Stealth Mode and Hero Time. Stealth Mode allows John to sneak around quietly, even being able to grab his foes and use them as hostages. This means it may not be best to go in guns blazing, when they could be arrested. Hero Time allows John to react far more quickly, just like Bullet Time in Max Payne. Hero Time is earned by saving hostages and performing heroic tasks in the game. There are several different weapons available in the game, ranging from a paintball gun for training to a sniper rifle. Most of the guns can also be used dual for the ultimate killing spree.</story>

    <story>Set after the events of Final Fantasy VII and the Final Fantasy VII- Advent Children movie, Dirge of Cerberus lets players take the role of the mysterious Vincent Valentine. After a new organization arises from the events known as Meteorfall, Vincent is called to the surviving town of Kalm by Reeve Tuesti, an old ally who controlled Cait Sith. Vincent has been invited to the town&apos;s celebration, but during the festivities, a group of soldiers attacks the town, killing and capturing the people. It is up to Vincent to protect the innocent once more, and find out why these soldiers are also after him. While set in the world of Final Fantasy VII, Dirge of Cerberus is an action shooter that runs through twelve chapters. The on-screen action can be controlled by the analog controller, or via the Playstation 2&apos;s mouse and keyboard accessories, making it more in line with PC-style shooters. Being a character driven shooter, the perspective can be changed from first to third person on the fly to navigate through the multi-level environments. Several items and characters from the series make their return, as well as the Chaos break limits system, which allows Vincent to take the monstrous forms he changed into from Final Fantasy VII to inflict more damage on the enemy. Taking a nod from its RPG-based parent, the game does allow Vincent to find the usual healing items, materia spells and gil from the Final Fantasy universe, in which he can buy and sell for other new items. The game also features a weapon customization system, which allows the player to mix and match weapon parts to form more powerful attack items and abilities.</story>

    <story>Keith Miyamoto is a reporter who works for an important newspaper in Los Angeles. In 2005, he travels to an island called Capital City, where he has to get a new job. But on his way from the airport to the city, a terrible earthquake occurs. The train collapses and Keith finds himself abandoned by the rescue team. Now he has to escape the island, try to save the people stranded on it, and discover the true reasons behind the chaos in the city. But that will be anything but easy. The earthquake continues, and any time Keith steps on a half-collapsed bridge, crawls over a pile of rumble, or climbs a narrow path between ruined houses, the earth can start trembling... This game, also known as Zettai Zetsumei Toshi (Japanese original title), or SOS - Final Escape (European title), is a combination of pure adventure and survival/horror genres. The controls, the inventory management, the camera, that changes angles automatically depending on your location, but mostly the necessity to survive can be linked to Alone in the Dark and its countless clones, while the complete lack of enemies to fight reminds of a classic adventure. There are many ways to preserve Keith from constant dying. You can find items and combine them into new ones (for example, finding a helmet and a lamp will allow you to build a helmet with a flashlight attached to it). Keith will also need to quench his thirst, so you&apos;ll have to find water for him. The water taps found in the game serve also as save points.</story>

    <story>In order to lift the curse placed upon the inhabitants of Veldime 15 years prior, the protagonist&apos;s mother attempts to summon the evil Overilord Zenon so that her son Adell can defeat him and lift the curse. Instead his daughter, Rozalin is summoned, and Adell commits to returning her home to her father, as well as to defeating her father when they find him. The game is a turn-based strategy RPG in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics. Classes gain abilities by gaining character levels, and can level up those abilities through use. New items and equipment can be bought or won in battle, and can be powered up up by entering and winning battles inside a given item. Characters can also gang up on enemies by performing combos that are activated by positioning other characters near an attacking character. This action only uses the attacking character&apos;s turn, leaving the others free to attack again. Clever coordination can have characters attacking quite a few times per turn. New characters can be created (or even reborn as other classes or just more powerful versions of the same class) by petitioning (or even bribing with special items) the Dark Assembly with Mana you earn by defeating enemies.</story>

His mission- defending the evil industrial magnate Saber who manipulates home appliances and uses them as weapons. Not surprisingly these are the main foes in this game. But Darwin is not even close to helpless- various guns and gadgets, e.g. a jet pack, a electronic whip or a grappling hook, are used to dispatch of them. Most of the time is spent in fights but there are also puzzles. Many of them require the usage of Mooch, a fly. It can be summoned at any time and is able to reach high grounds, to deactivate electronic devices, to fly through small holes and even to slow down time to pass through fast moving obstacles. During the course of the game the player can find computer chips and hidden disks. On one hand these can be used to refresh ammo and health or to upgrade weapons. There is also the option to switch to a infrared view and scan objects. This rewards additional information. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions have an optional playing mode for 3D glasses.</story>

    <story>Disney&apos;s Dinosaur is a puzzle-adventure game based on the movie of the same name. You control three characters- Flia the pteradon, Aladar the Iguanadon and Zini the lemur, each of whom has different abilities. Flia can fly, Aladar can wade through water and crush rocks and Zini can fit through small spaces and pick things up. The game is seen from a top-down perspective, with the player switching characters on the fly. As in the movie, they must work together to reach the sacred nesting grounds for water and food after the rest of world dries up. Throughout the game, the characters&apos; abilities are upgraded via an Intelligent Points System in an RPG-like addition. There are twelve levels divided into four acts. The game includes FMV clips from the movie and a dinosaur encyclopedia with information about real dinosaurs.</story>

    <story>You play as Donald in this 3d platform action game. Donald&apos;s girlfriend, Daisy is a reporter for a television station in Duckberg.

Along the way he will have help from his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and the inventor Gyro Gearloose. He will also have competition from Gladstone Gander, who is also trying to save Daisy. Game play alternates between side-scrolling running and jumping and 3d running and jumping. The side scrolling levels play a lot like the Super Mario Bros. games. The 3d levels play a lot like the Crash Bandicoot series of games. All in all, there are 20 levels, spread out through areas.</story>

    <story>When intercepting Drakken and Shego&apos;s latest plan to swipe a mystical monkey idol from a spooky mansion, Dr. Drakken and Ron Stoppable get their minds switched! The idol is quickly lost, and Kim Possible and her arch-rival Shego reluctantly team up to get it back and set things back to normal. Kim Possible- What&apos;s the Switch? is a side-scrolling 2D platformer with visual similarities to Klonoa 2, excluding the ability to change the paths you take. The camera follows Kim (or Shego) as you progress through various levels - while it plays like a 2D platformer, it gives the illusion of 3D. The main goal of each level is to get to the end of the level; however, there are also sub-goals of collecting all the Kimmunicator tokens within a level (which unlock concept art amongst other things), and collecting the Club Banana tokens hidden in secret spots (which unlock new outfits to wear). Shego and Kim control quite similarly, in that they can both perform kung-fu attacks, backflips and double jumps. Later on, they both gain the ability to use a grapple and EMP bomb to disable special enemies. In addition to this, Kim has super sticky gum which can be used to snag enemies and control switches remotely, while Shego gains a magnetic power to move metal objects from far away.</story>

Christopher suggests that he think of something else...something happy to forget about his hunger. Pooh decide to recall his friends&apos; birthdays - which are the happiest of times. In Winnie the Pooh&apos;s Rumbly Tumbly Adventure, join Pooh and his friends in Hundred Acre Woods on three different types of games- Birthday Scrapbook Adventure Mode- Pooh flips through his birthday scrapbook and re-live 5 different birthday adventures. Each adventure consists of tasks and problems Pooh has to help solve in order to ensure his friends have the best birthday ever. Pooh can interact with many different elements around him. For example, if there&apos;s a box blocking his way, have Pooh push it away. Gopher is always near by to pop up and give Pooh tips on what he has to to do and how to do it. Pooh will also have to talk to other characters to complete his tasks. For example, in Piglet&apos;s Birthday, you will have to find Kenga and borrow her broom for Piglet. Some tasks will require the help of Pooh&apos;s friends. For instance, you will have to help Roo collect butterflies for Piglet&apos;s birthday by climbing on Eeyore&apos;s back and running after the butterflies. Every now and then Pooh will be confronted by Heffalumps and Woozles. Avoid being touched by them because that will cause you to have to start that segment all over. The only way to get rid of them is by popping a balloon...but don&apos;t worry, there is always one near by. Junior Mode- a place for younger players to interactive with Pooh and his friends in Hundred Acre Woods. See what happens when Pooh approaches a hive or play as Tigger as he spins around. Multiplayer Mini-Game-Play as Pooh, Roo, Tigger or Piglet in 6 mini-games on your own or with a friend!- Cookie Maze - Grab as many cookies as possible while avoiding the Heffalumps and Woozles.

Locating footprints is also done via this Smellovision mode. Tricks can be learnt, and used to win treats from humans. Jake must explore vast environments and interact with 15 breeds of dog. The aim is to get them onto his side, which is usually done by either having more bones than them, or winning a subgame against them. These are also dog-based - in one you must dig up bones, while another has you &apos;marking territory&apos; to annex a full screen.</story>

    <story>In Dokapon Kingdom monsters have attacked and pillaged the kingdom of its riches. For the adventurer who returns the kingdom&apos;s wealth, his majesty offers the honor of his daughter&apos;s hand, and therefore the title of future king. This doesn&apos;t mean, however, that you aren&apos;t permitted to play as a female character. You simply receive an altered ending in this instance. Three different modes are available- Story Mode, Normal Mode, and Shopping Race. You then create your character and begin play, the mode you choose having an affect on the overall goal to be achieved. The Story Mode is the standard play through of the plot, Normal Mode lets you generate certain factors of play ahead of time, like starting level, and go from there, etc. There are 3 started classes (warrior, chief and magician) and through levelling eventually 11 become available. While having a board game scenario with a spinner that allows the player to move over a game board, this is very much a light role-playing game as it has basic jobs, a battle system, and upgrades. Landing on a spot can trigger a battle, advance the story or introduce a mini-game. It is a 2-player game at all times (with another character controlled by the computer), but up to 4 people can participate.</story>

    <story>.hack//G.U. Vol. 1- Rebirth takes place three years after .hack//QUARANTINE ended. One year after The Twilight Incident, a huge fire started in CC Corp destroying most of the original The World servers and forcing them to shut the game down soon after. A new version of the The World was created one year after the fire called The World R-2. You play as Haseo, a PKK (Player Killer Killer) searching for the player killer who Data Drained his friend into a coma, Tri-Edge. The player meets reliable friends in Gaspard, Silabus, Atoli, Kuhn and many others later in game. The battle system is still real-time but with mostly hack and slash action. Also, when the player lands a certain number of combos on an enemy and they glow blue and yellow you can perform special Rengeki moves. Rengeki moves get more powerful as you progress through the game. The player also has a morale gauge in the top right corner of your screen. When the gauge is full, the player can perform an Awakening attack with help from his/her party members. There are two types of Awakening attacks, Demon and Beast Awakening. The Demon Awakening lets you unleash powerful magic attacks without using SP (Skill Points). The Beast Awaking makes the player invulnerable to physical attacks for a set period of time while enhancing his/her physical abilities. New features added are guilds, arena battles and weapon customization. Guilds are groups people join for various reasons. The player can join at least two this game. Arena battles are basically two teams of three characters battling each other for fun or for championships. Weapon customization can be done with items the player gets on travels or buys in shops to element or status effect to your weapons.</story>

    <story>.hack//G.U. Vol. 2- Reminisce is the second game in the .hack//G.U. trilogy and picks up where Volume 1 left off. The story takes place in The World, a fictional massively multiplayer online role-playing game. You control Haseo, a player-killer killer whom along with his friends discovers they are unable to log out of The World. As is typical in the .hack series, there&apos;s a connection between events in the real world and in the online world and as the story continues Haseo will need to figure out how to save himself and his friends in both worlds. The story is told through a series of cut-scenes as well as by talking with other characters, receiving e-mails, and by finding posts in The World&apos;s online message boards. Since the game is a continuation of the previous game, many of the same locations and dungeons are utilized again. The game uses a similar battle system as the previous game; a battle is initiated by running into an enemy that&apos;s visible on screen where you will then be able to perform a variety of attacks on the enemies in real time. Once again you can perform special Rengeki moves after performing a series of combo attacks which inflict additional damage. Also available are several awakening attacks which are the most powerful. During a battle you may have up to three members in your party fighting, though you only control Haseo while the other two characters are computer controlled. Experience points are earned for a successful battle which help your characters level up and become more powerful; a variety of missions, side quests, and dungeons are available allowing for numerous monsters of varying levels to fight.</story>

    <story>.hack//G.U. Vol. 3- Redemption is the third and final game in the .hack//G.U. trilogy. Player&apos;s once again control Haseo, a player-killer killer in the fictional online role playing game The World. The game&apos;s story continues from where Volume 2 left off. AIDA, a deadly virus, continues to cause trouble in both the online world and the real world. Haseo will need to figure out the truth behind the virus and defeat it in order to save himself and his friends. As with the previous games, the story unfolds through a series of cut scenes as well as by e-mails you&apos;ll receive and by reading The World&apos;s online message boards. Since the game is a continuation of the previous installments, many of the locations, dungeons, and characters return along with several new dungeons and characters. If you have completed the previous games, data can be transferred in when you start this volume giving you an advantage. The game uses a battle system which is similar to the previous games; it is in real time and is activated after Haseo comes in contact with an enemy while exploring The World. Up to three members of your party may join a battle; the player always controls Haseo while two additional members are computer controlled. Simple orders can be given to the computer controlled characters to guide their actions. Once again several attacks are available including a regular attack, charge attack, and various skills. After performing a series of combos, Rengeki attacks are available which inflict more damage. The most powerful are awakening mode attacks which require a certain amount of points on your morale gauge. New to this game is Avatar Awakening which replaces the Divine Awakening from the previous game. Avatar Awakening allows you to use the power of your avatar to perform Data Drain on your opponents which will be particularly useful in fighting the virus. Successfully winning battles will earn experience points which allow Haseo and other characters to level up and become more powerful. Many missions, side quests, and dungeons are available with various enemies to fight and to help continue the story.</story>

Your quest starts out to find out what caused your friend to go in to a coma. This involves adventuring after sightings of the strange girl and hacking in to sealed levels. There also seems to be corrupted levels and something going on that the CC Corporation (owner of “The World) is trying to hide. .hack//INFECTION is part of Ban Dai&apos;s dot hack project that first starts with the Anime DVD series (.hack//Sign).

Some player characters in The World are mysteriously falling comatose - your main character Kite has to investigate the matter, aided by companions he meets on his trip through the virtual world. Like the first two hack games, this is an action RPG - essentially a dungeon crawler. You can pause at any time during the battle to issue commands (such as using items). In Outbreak, you and your opponents start at around level 50 and can reach level 70. You can also import a saved game from the previous game, .hack//MUTATION.</story>

    <story>Downhill Domination is a racing game where the player rides a bike and tries to win downhill races. This means that the player constantly moves downwards while avoiding obstacles and - if he is in range - hit an opponent to hinder his progress. The main objective is of course to be the first one to cross the finishing line but prize money is also rewarded for stunts - opportunities for them are plentiful on the 27 courses. An important point about them is that they are branching, meaning they feature multiple paths and shortcuts. Cash is used to improve the athlete&apos;s abilities, e.g. new combat moves, or to buy better equipment and bikes. Besides the career mode there are also multiple additional playing modes, e.g. training, multiplayer, freeride, time trials or BMX Cross with special challenges. The athletes, bikes and upgrades are licensed.</story>

The game features eight gaming modes. Besides the usual championship and quick race modes the most interesting possibilities are chase where the player races against the police and last man standing where the goal is to wreck the other cars. The 14 cars are licensed, e.g. from Audi or Peugeot.</story>

    <story>The evil Wizard/Jester Dhoulmagus came to the Kingdom of Trodain seeking a powerful magical scepter sealed beneath the Castle. Using the power of the scepter, Dhoulmagus destroyed the Castle of Trodain, placed a curse upon the Kingdom and its people, and turned King Trode and the Princess into beasts. You play as the sole surviving castle guard, who journeys with the King, Princess and a reformed bandit named Yangus in search of the evil wizard and a way to break the curse. Along the way you will gain new allies, fight monsters, delve into deep dungeons, and perform heroic deeds. Stylistically, this game is a blend of old and new. It is, at the core, a very traditional RPG; there is a lot of combat, and leveling up takes some work; you start out very weak, at 1st level, with no healing spells; there is strong differentiation between character classes; you heal at the inn, but can only save at a church; etc. On the surface there are a number of more modern refinements, however, including voice acting, 3D graphics, very complex enemies, animated menus and battle scenes, etc. This game, the eighth in the series, is the first installment of Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior available for the PS2. It features a huge, lush world with full day and night cycles. Series artist and Dragonball/Z creator Akira Toriyama designed the game’s anime style, 3D, cell-shaded characters and monsters. Music was composed by Koichi Sugiyama. The international version features several updates to the original Japanese version, including voice-acting, graphic menu, symphonic soundtracks, and flashier effects.</story>

    <story>Drakengard follows the story of a kingdomless prince named Caim who fights for the Union against the Empire. Under the Union&apos;s protection are the Hierarchs and the Goddess, currently Caim&apos;s sister Furiae, who is a human manifestation of one of the four seals that protect the world from being broken. As the game begins, Cain is fatally wounded in a battle with the Empire. Encountering a captured Red Dragon who is also near death, Caim makes a fateful choice. In exchange for both their lives, the Red Dragon and Caim will enter a pact. This pact will forever chain their lives to one another and link their souls, at the cost of something irreplaceable. Recharged with the fires of a Dragon, Caim&apos;s vengeance burns over the enemy... The player controls Caim on his quest. The game is separated into three distinct modes- Aerial combat, Ground combat and Event Combat. In Aerial Combat, Caim rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Caim, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield. These are leveled up through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. Though magic (determined by weapon choice), timed attacks and evasion, Caim breaks through enemy armies. Characters recruited as allies by Caim can also be summoned during battles, steadily losing health until control is returned to Caim. In ground combat, Caim may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. The Dragon&apos;s movements are generally the same as in aerial combat but more limited and less agile. Event combat is similar to Ground combat, but shown isometrically, restricted to a single weapon and without the aid of a dragon. It is used mainly to tell story sequences. Levels that have been visited before might become Expedition Missions which are optional and contain new objectives, enemies and weapons. Additionally, any level previously played in the storyline may be revisited at any time. Depending on Caim&apos;s choices (and prerequisites for those choices), there are five different endings to Drakengard.</story>

    <story>Because of the events of the first game the world was broken, requiring the Red Dragon, Angelus, to restore the magical seals and hold back the apocalypse. In the eighteen years since, the Union has taken rule over the land and made prisoner the former soldiers of the Empire&apos;s forces. The priestess child Mannah has grown and lives in the company of these imprisoned forces. Among the Union forces, the Knights of the Seal were formed in dedication to the protection of the magical seals. General Oror of the Knights was on a campaign in the wilds when he came across a young boy, named Nowe, who was cared for and able to talk to the Blue Dragon, Legna. Deciding to raise the boy as his son, Oror brought both Nowe and Legna back to the Union. The Hierach leader, Seere, recognized Nowe&apos;s potential and dubbed him The Savior. Over time, Nowe grew up among the knights and aspired to join their ranks. Now finally after many years and training, Nowe is ready to formally become a member of the Knights of the Seal... Drakengard 2 is a 3rd person role-playing action game like the first title. The player controls Nowe on his quest, as well as other characters who join him along the way. The game is separated into two modes- Aerial combat and Ground combat. In Aerial Combat, Nowe rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Nowe, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield. Each type of weapon can only be equipped by a specific character, and so changing to a new weapon type will also change the playable character from Nowe to another member of his party. These weapons are leveled up, gaining new combos and more powerful magic, through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. Accessories and items, such as healing and magic restorers, can also be found and used during combat. Though magic (determined by weapon choice), timed attacks and evasion, Nowe is able to defeat enemies and earn experience. Defeated enemies drop items and coins, though weapons are only found in treasure chests. In ground combat, Nowe may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. The Dragon&apos;s movements are generally the same as in aerial combat but more limited and less agile. Progress in the game is shown on the world map. Levels that have been visited before might become Expedition Missions which are optional and contain new objectives, enemies and weapons. Additionally, any level previously played in the storyline may be revisited at any time. Additionally, villages will appear which sell weapons and items in exchange for gold coins.</story>

    <story>Driver- Parallel Lines is the fourth game in the Driver series, following the story of TK. In 1978, TK (who was then an 18-year-old driver-for-hire who had just graduated from high school) was sentenced to 28 years in prison for a crime he did not commit, and is released from prison in 2006. Now, with his driving skills, he seeks revenge against the police department for having to serve time for something someone else should&apos;ve gone to prison for! Unlike Driv3r, Driver- Parallel Lines mostly takes place behind the wheel, returning back to the formula that made the first game a classic. The game still has a GTA-style open-ended design, though, and you can still exit your vehicle for some on-foot action. However, there&apos;s no reason to exit your vehicle unless it&apos;s damaged and you can no longer drive it, as almost all of the game&apos;s missions involve cop car chases. If that&apos;s the case, then you can either go to the repair shop to repair your vehicle, or just steal someone else&apos;s vehicle! Until then, you can punch the cops with your fists and steal their weapons when they&apos;re dead, so that you can use them for future on-foot combat. The game takes place in both 1978 (before TK went to prison) and in 2006. The 2006 setting has a much more modern soundtrack than the 1978 setting, which has a mostly disco soundtrack. Obviously, the 2006 setting has the architecture, technology, and cars of today.</story>

    <story>Dropship is an action game set in the year 2050. Terrorist attacks have increased severely, which is why big nations of the world decided to form the UPF, United Peace Force, replacing the UN and NATO. It is an anti-terror army, operating world-wide. But there is another globally operating group- A massively militarised drug syndicate. When an attack on a peace convoy in Columbia is linked to this cartel, the UPF starts investigation. A central base and training camp of the drug cartel is believed to be located somewhere in Libya. The UPF opens up a base in this country and starts looking for the criminals. The player is a recently recruited soldier and pilot of the UPF. During the campaign, which lasts for 20 rather long missions, he can travel and fight on foot, in tanks and various other ground vehicles, but most of the time he will be piloting a dropship, either of the attack, defender or transport class. Dropships can operate in hover and flight mode, and carry a large amount of weapons and cargo. Dropship simulates a massive, global conflict, with the player taking part in all the action. Six training missions make it easier to learn the controls of the game.</story>

    <story>Long, long ago, the real world and dream world were one and the same. But because of the dark thoughts in people&apos;s minds, the Nightmare was born and threatened to end the world. A brave sage appeared and, by using the Holy Instruments and the Dream Stone, sealed the Nightmare away into the holy land. Peace was restored but the world is now separated into the real world and dream world. Years later, people forgot what has happened, and only recalled the events as a legend. Many have also heard about the Dream Stone sealed within the Temple of Dreams. Enter our hero, Rumble, a Ruinseeker (a high ranked treasure hunter) who wish to find the Dream Stone. At the same time, in the Dreamworld, a Baku (a weird looking animal that lives in the Dreamworld) who Rumble later names Tumble accidentally drops the box which holds 7 keys to the seal of the Temple. The keys went and hid in different people&apos;s dreams. To retrieve them, one must enter the dream and seek out the keys. Tumble can enter the dreams but there are many monsters within dreams and puzzles that he may need help with. Rumble realize he must get the keys in order to find the Dream Stone. Seeing that the two can help meet each other&apos;s goals, Rumble and Tumble decides to work together. In Dual Hearts, Rumble and Tumble will travel around Sonno Island, meeting the people there and seek out those whose dreams holds one of the 7 keys. Each dream is different as each person is different. This means, the enemies and puzzles Rumble will encounter will be different in each dream he visits. For example, the first dreamer will be another treasure hunter. Within the dreamworld, everything is filled with gold and gems. Even the boss is a giant money bag! Within the dreams, Rumble will be able to use the Holy Instruments (in the form of a spear and sword) to fight enemies there. Rumble can use both weapons at the same time enabling him to do a variety of combo attacks. Tumble will help Rumble by carrying him on his back, enabling him to reach higher planes. He can also perform different attacks like the Breath Attack. In order to advance, there are a variety of puzzles for our heroes to solve. For example, in one puzzle, you will be presented with movable blocks, several switches and a closed door. You must figure out which switch will open the door and move the block on the switch. If you run into any problems, you can always talk to Tumble or the Dream Sheep for hints and help.</story>

    <story>Dynasty Warriors 3- Xtreme Legends is a stand-alone expansion to Dynasty Warriors 3. In both games, you take control of a military general in ancient China, each with their own unique abilities and weapons. The gameplay is simple- you destroy hoards of differently ranked enemies on an open battlefield. Your objective in most missions is to defeat one or more enemy generals. Each character you choose has a different storyline (this story mode is referred to as Musou Mode), with seven battles progressing the story along. Battles get harder as you move along in the story. There is also a free mode, which allows you to play any level that you have unlocked with any general that you have unlocked (you start the game with three generals from three different dynasties). The difference between Xtreme Legends and the original Dynasty Warriors 3 is that in Xtreme Legends, the Musou Mode only features seven unaligned generals that you couldn&apos;t play as in the original. There are also challenge modes in Xtreme Legends not featured in the original. And there is a more advanced bodyguard system allowing you to name them, customize their advancement, and choose from more weapons you unlock as you play through the game.</story>

    <story>About 1800 years ago in China, there were three fearless warriors battling for ultimate control over the country. One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared the same swarmed under each leader. These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way. They followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors. Dynasty Warriors 3 takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win. Each character has their own unique weapon type and magic ability, although they can share weaker variations of weapons with other characters who use the same style of weapon. Weapons and items are dropped randomly from boxes in levels as well as from defeated enemy generals, and each has a range of stats dependent on the difficulty level and the strength of the general. The most powerful weapons and items, however, can only be collected by completing hidden objectives as each character. Characters grow more powerful by collecting stat up items from defeated generals, and doing well in levels rewards points that level up the bodyguards who follow the player character. Most completed levels can be replayed with any character and any side in free mode. An encyclopedia is included as well that details every event and character from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, even those that never appear in Dynasty Warriors 3.</story>

    <story>Dynasty Warriors 4- Empires is a strategy-oriented variant of Dynasty Warriors 4, mixing it with gameplay similar to Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The heart of the game, campaign mode, begins by choosing any of 24 regions and 42 rulers (custom characters can be created). Beginning with a small kingdom, the ultimate goal is the conquering of all others. Each turn, the player is given a choice from 4 different governing options (brought to your attention by your generals) followed by a single decision of action. These actions typically include the invasion or defense of a specific province or the option to aid an allied empire with those same actions. In any battle, be it offense or defense, the player chooses up to three generals and three lieutenants and their troops to form the army. Soldiers fill the battlefield with different ranks and styles (normal, archers, guards, sorceresses and 2 types of siege weapons) as well as horses which can be riden. The player, in 3rd person perspective, may guard, parry, attack, charge, fire arrows, jump, announce or charge up to unleash a special musou attack. All generals and lieutenants are displayed on the map and may be attacked or challenged. Enemy characters who are defeated enough times in a battle can be challenged to a duel. The obvious goal of the battlefield is to control strongholds at strategic points that will make it easier to defend or reach a certain area or opponent. At any given time, these stronghold areas are under control of either of the two sides. They are won by defeating all of the opposing forces in the immediate area. Strongholds routinely generate health recovery items. The winner of a offensive action can win territory and capture enemy soldiers. Each province under control of an empire nets that empire 100 gold each turn which may be spent on various governing decisions. The game also features a 2-player mode where players compete against one another in 4 different styles- Defeat more enemies (Vanquish), Collect more treasure (Pilfer), Knock more enemies off a wall (Melee) and a test of survival (Endurance). The game also features unlockable art galleries and data that can be imported from either Dynasty Warriors 4 or Dynasty Warriors 3- Xtreme Legends.</story>

    <story>Set in ancient China, DW5- Empires brings the Empire mode to the latest DW game, while the basic hack &amp; slash, button mashing gameplay remains the same. The Empire mode adds a strategy overlay to the basic game, with a map of 25 areas to conquer. Each turn consists of two parts- empire control, and war making. Your territories bring you tax revenue each turn, which you can spend on various different actions. You can create items and tactics for your generals to use in battle. Recruit generals and troops, fortify your territories, among many other command options. You can wage war on other territories, or may be called upon to defend your own. For each battle you select which generals and lieutenants will fight. There are 4 scenarios to unlock, though they offer little to differentiate each other. There is two player split-screen co-op, in either of Empire of Free play modes. Next to the soundtrack of the base game, this edition also adds soundtracks from previous titles, including Dynasty Warriors 2, Dynasty Warriors 3 and Dynasty Warriors 4.</story>

    <story>A kind of expansion to Dynasty Warriors 5, Xtreme Legends allows the player to do a lot more with the Romance of the Three Kingdoms generals. Standard battles and co-op are still present, plus a new character creation feature and &apos;destiny&apos; mode which sees you follow a soldier from grunt to officer. Xtreme Legends can be played by itself or it can be used with an existing Dynasty Warriors 5 save file in order to unlock new content such as battlefields and dozens of characters based on the novels. In most respects the game sticks to the tried and tested Dynasty Warriors formula, and the core gameplay boils down to charging one general into the ranks of the enemy and coming out unscathed, all underscored by cheesy rock guitars.</story>

    <story>The sixth main game in the long running Dynasty Warriors series (or fifth if one goes by the original Japanese naming scheme) once again allows the player to take a legendary hero from the quasi-historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms into battle against thousands of enemy peons. The player needs to battle his way through numerous battlefields, capturing forts and succeeding in objectives in order to bring about victory for his faction. It is an action game with traces of strategy when the player is faced with how to achieve certain sub-missions during a battle. It is the first of the series to be designed specifically for Xbox 360/Playstation 3 generation of consoles and graphically makes better use of their hardware, allowing for sharper detail and more enemies on screen. New elements include a redesigned combo system, called Renbu where longer, though less varied, attack strings can be made and the ability to climb and swim. Contrary to tradition of past games in the series, Dynasty Warriors 6 offers fewer characters than before. Forty one characters are eventually unlocked, but only seventeen have story modes, each designed specifically for that character. The others can be used in the game&apos;s free mode and can be built up and obtain weapons and skills.</story>

Each Ed has their own abilities- Eddy can hurl stink bombs and form a tower to reach high objects, Ed can dig in sandpits, lift and throw objects, and charge at things to smash them, while Double Dee can use his slingshot, activate machines, and be thrown high into the air by the other two Eds.</story>

    <story>Egg Mania is a puzzle game in which the player controls an egg shaped character against either a computer opponent or another player via the link cable. The object of the main modes is to build a tower tall enough to reach a balloon at the top of the play field before the opponent does. If the player tries to take a short cut and not build complete floors, the structure will start crumbling and the water will come up faster. There are plenty of obstacles, both from the game and from competing opponents. Falling meteors can knock the player down into the water, while bombs thrown by the opponent will destroy parts of the player&apos;s structure. The main modes include Over Easy and Hard Boiled, the difference being that in the latter a different difficulty can be chosen. There are four extra modes- Survival, Solo, Time Trial and Bomb. In Survival the player must survive as many rounds as possible, while the goal in Solo is to increase the overall score by completing rows and performing combos; Time Trial challenges the player to continually beat his or her own best time; finally, in Bomb, whoever destroys the opponent&apos;s tower first wins. Compared to the GBA version, the console versions have improved graphics and sound, cutscenes at the beginning of each level, a play area that is wider by one block, two additional modes (8-player Tournament and Custom, where the rules can be customized by activating different options), but lacks the Time Trial mode. Otherwise they are completely identical, both in gameplay and level design.</story>

The main character is Jade Cornell, a foxy redhead, whose friend Tyler has gotten too close to the truth. The game starts when Jade receives a message from him telling her where to find the gun he left in her apartment. As soon as she grabs the gun, the door bursts open .. and the first gunfight begins. The game is played out in five fast-and-furious chapters, all of which are timed. Jade will trek through exotic European locales (including the Swiss Alps and the London Underground), shooting baddies and bosses. The faster you shoot each wave of enemies the better, as the time saved is added to the next chapter. The environment is totally destructible. You can shoot pictures off the walls, shoot cabinets open and have glassware crash to the floor and otherwise wreck much of your surroundings. Also, you can cause explosions that will kill all the enemies in the vicinity. Finishing the game the first time unlocks additional modes of play and mini-games.</story>

    <story>In this game, you control Mouse (that&apos;s his name!), a silent musician, who travels with his talking guitar Pattimo. One day Mouse is invited to play at a royal wedding on an island called Pandule. But soon you discover that the groom Xelpherpolis (the name sounds like a Greek town!) has put an awful time-looping spell on the island, and intends to destroy this way the entire population. You have to stop the villain! Most important, you have to recruit other people to your small army. Ephemeral Fantasia combines diverse features from earlier games for different platforms- the time-looping is a reminiscent of Zelda- Ocarina of Time for Nintendo 64; the game possesses an internal clock (hours and days), like in Quest for Glory series for PC or in Shenmue for Dreamcast; its role-playing system, turn-based combat and character design are clearly inspired by Final Fantasy games.</story>

    <story>Guybrush Threepwood has finally defeated the zombie pirate LeChuck, and married his sweetheart Elaine Marley. The happy couple is returning home from an exciting honeymoon. But as they arrive on Melee Island, they notice some very strange changes. A mysterious stranger who calls himself Charles L. Charles is organizing a campaign to become the next governor. The Australian businessman Ozzie Mandrill is turning the Caribbean into an attraction for tourists. And on top of that, Elaine&apos;s mansion is being demolished! Naturally, it&apos;s up to our hero to revert the things back to normal, even if that means traveling to exotic islands and solving puzzles on the way. Escape From Monkey Island is a direct sequel to The Curse of Monkey island, and is the fourth game in the Monkey Island series. The gameplay relies mainly on inventory-based puzzles and branching dialogues, just like in the previous installments. The interface is similar to that of Grim Fandango- mouse is not used, and the interaction is done via context-sensitive commands that appear on the screen whenever you navigate Guybrush close to an object. The game utilizes pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D character models.</story>

    <story>ESPN College Hoops is the second of Sega&apos;s college basketball games and follow-up to NCAA 2K3, to which it adds several new gameplay modes and other enhancements. It also carries over several of ESPN NBA Basketball&apos;s improvements in controls and graphics. Returning game modes include Quick Play, Exhibition, Season, Legacy, Tournament, Practice and Gym Rat. The Legacy mode has redesigned menus and adds full season recruiting via assistant coaches, scout visits of high school games and a new trophy room. New modes include Rival mode, which lets players set up quick games that feature classic school rivalries, and Slam Dunk Challenge. The Challenge offers five different dunk competitions- Beat the Clock, Style, Horse, Dunk-O-War (who can fire up the crowd the most, needs to be unlocked) and a Championship of all modes. Dunks are executed through QTE-style pressing of buttons in the correct order in quick succession. Players can create their own schools in the new Create-A-School mode, allowing for customization of mascot, fight song and even floor type. On the court, major changes include IsoMotion controls similar to those seen in ESPN NBA, which allow a variety of new offensive moves and manual stealing on defense through use of the right thumbstick. Also new are ability icons, which quickly indicate a player&apos;s special skill (speed, 3-point-shots, defense or star quality). The game features many unlockables in the Campus Store. Currency for the store is earned by completing challenges on the court, which can then be spent to unlock mascot teams, alternate uniforms, professional and fantasy courts and classic teams.</story>

Back are all of the game play modes from last years release- exhibition, playoffs, season, and franchise. Additionally, gamecast, duel, situation and GM career have been added to the game. In gamecast mode, you can manage and watch a game as it progresses, make substitutions and then jump into the action when you want to. In duel mode, you&apos;ll pick a pitcher and hitter and duke it out against the computer to see who can get the most hits and who can throw the most strikes. In situation mode, you can set the field up how you want to and change a number of settings like how many players on base to what inning it is and who is up to bat so you can figure out your ultimate &apos;what-if&apos; scenario. In GM career mode, you&apos;ll need to run a franchise while keeping your owner happy. Got an owner who is financially conscious? He&apos;ll want you to make sure you hire only moderately priced players and do reasonably well. Get a maverick, and you&apos;ll get a longer leash, a bit more money, but the added pressure of needing to take your team to the playoffs. All 30 MLB teams are included with their stadiums along with 16 different all-star teams. It also has 6 classic stadiums and a team made up of the greatest players of all time. Each team also has a number of alternate and throwback jerseys. Also, new is the ESPN authentic feel in the form of graphics and play break downs. Get a particularly nice strike out and you&apos;ll get to see the trajectory with ESPN K-Zone. Strike someone out three times in a row and Rex Hudler and Jon Miller will applaud you for a job well done. You can also use the X-box version to grab the latest roster or play against someone online in an exhibition game on either the PS2 or the X-box version.</story>

You get over one hundred new items, a respect system, the ability to play multiplayer games, and new timed mini-games. Like all of the 2K5 titles, this one has the standard ESPN presentation, which includes camera angles, follow-cams, stat overlays, and running commentary. Commentators include Michele Tafoya, who reports from the sideline, and Bill Walton, a hall of famer, as the commentator.

It also comes standard with franchise mode, which lets you lead a team of your choice to victory (or defeat) in multiple seasons. The newest and biggest mode of the game is 24/7, which starts you off as a nobody basketball player in a local gym. You must win matches to improve your stats (scoring two three pointers in a row will increase your long shot stat, etc.), and you have to take on bosses to get further. Beat a boss, and he&apos;ll give you his cell phone number, which you can then use to call him for help if you need a partner for a doubles game.

    <story>ESPN NFL 2K5 has a ton of new features for the new season. To start off, the ESPN presentation has been greatly expanded. Chris Berman, who did voiceover for the half-time show in 2K4, returns for this season. Instead of just voice, there is a virtual Chris Berman, who does an introduction to each game, a half-time report, and a post-game show. To illiustrate certain points, he uses replays from each game. Every move you pull off of every quarter of every game is saved and used in these replays (Xbox only). Suzy Kobler gives reports from the sideline. One new feature is the V.I.P. system, which keeps track of how you play the game. If you pass 80% of the time, and run 20% of the time, your V.I.P. profile will reflect this. At a later time, you can play against your V.I.P., and the AI will play as if it were you. ESPN celebrates it&apos;s 25th anniversary this year, and as such, a special 25th Anniversary Mode has been added. This mode allows you to play moments from classic football games, including The Heidi Bowl and The Immaculate Reception. The Crib has an overhaul this year. Instead of earning specific items by completing tasks, you earn points, which you can use to buy items of your choice. New to the Crib is a dart board, as well as a phone, which you will use to answer calls from celebrities. You may get a call from Steve-O, Carmen Electra, Jamie Kennedy, David Arquette or Funkmaster Flex, challenging you to a game. Franchise mode also gets an overhaul. New to 2005 is the ability to schedule weekly preps for your team. You can choose to have players work out, play practice games, watch tapes, all in an effort to gear your team up for the next game. ESPN NFL 2K5 can be played over Xbox Live, with future support for leagues. The game is also always connected, as long as you have an internet connection. This allows it to keep buddy lists up to date, see friends, receive requests, all the time, whether you&apos;re actually playing an online game or not. Roster updates will be available in the future.</story>

ESPN NFL Football has many gameplay modes that include quick game, franchise, season, tournament, practice, first-person football, and online play.

The objectives range from simple accomplishments, like looking at certain things in the game&apos;s menu, playing for one hour, and playing for five hours, to big play accomplishments, like returning a punt or kick for 99 yards or completing a game without dropping any passes. With every completed objective, you earn a trophy or item that you can use to decorate your crib. The items range from different-looking furniture, like couches and bar stools, to bobble heads and in-game cheats. You can also find hidden free agents, like Michael Irvin, and posters and soundtracks from old Sega games, like Jet Set Radio and previous NFL 2K games. Another feature added to this game is first-person football. This setup was created to give you a virtual experience of what it&apos;s like playing on the field.

    <story>ESPN NHL 2K5 is the second hockey game using Sega&apos;s partnership with the worldwide leader in sports, ESPN. As with any sports game, you get the standard game modes. 2K5 has a vastly improved Franchise mode over last year&apos;s game. In addition to the e-mail system that was introduced, you have the ability to hire several coaches. You can choose a head coach, offensive coach, defense coach, scouting coach, a goaltending coach and more. When it comes time to hire and fire players, you use actual money, and not points to negotiate contracts. There are a few special game modes as well. You have access to the skills mode, which was also found in last year&apos;s game. You can choose accuracy shooting, puck control, hardest shot, fastest skater, and a few more. There is also a Party Mode, which is set up for one to four players (you and friends or you and the computer), which pits you in fast action games. An example is a free-for-all, where you have to get the puck and score it in the net while the constantly moving cinder wall, which blocks the net, is down. Like last year&apos;s game, 2K5 features multiplayer hockey over Xbox Live (Xbox) and PlayStation 2&apos;s network service. You can jump into a game, or create or join a league of friends and foes. The Skybox is back, and it&apos;s been slightly improved. Like in ESPN NFL 2K5, you earn points by completing tasks, such as scoring five goals in a single period, winning ten faceoffs, etc. You then use these points to purchase unlockables which will adorn your Skybox or allow you to play as special teams. You can also unlock retro jerseys. Once you win a trophy, it&apos;s added to your Skybox, with the Stanley Cup being the center of attention. There are three mini-games you can play from your Skybox; air hockey, shuffleboard, and a trivia machine. For those who have an Xbox, you will have the ability to import the music on your harddrive and set songs (or bits of songs) to play for various events. You can choose to play something like Ozzy Osbourne&apos;s &amp;quot;Crazy Train&amp;quot; for the stadium intro, something uplifting for when you score or something insulting for when you get scored on. If you like doing a lot of work, you can even set different events depending on the stadium, so if you want &amp;quot;Crazy Train&amp;quot; to play in Anaheim for the stadium intro, but want &amp;quot;Dragula&amp;quot; in Detroit, you can.</story>

    <story>ESPN NHL Hockey is the latest addition in Sega&apos;s NHL 2K series of games that just happens to add an ESPN license to the graphics and title. As in the previous version (NHL 2K3), you can once again perform checks into the benches, pin opponents on the boards, and design penalty killing and power-play strategies. ESPN NHL Hockey adds a revamped franchise mode. This year&apos;s franchise mode includes an e-mail system that sends you notices about team injuries, current playoff statuses, and trade deadlines. Even simple words of encouragement are emailed from the team owner. The skybox mode acts as a hub for the game&apos;s unlockables, stat tracking, and other random features. There are two new gameplay modes in this year&apos;s game- skills and mini-games. Skills mode is a re-creation of the exhibition competitions held during the NHL All-Star weekend. You find a number of different competitions, including the hardest-shot competition, a shoot-out relay, a puck-control challenge, a fastest-skater competition, and a shooting-accuracy challenge. The roster of mini-games include pond hockey, mini-rink, shootout, and super-speed hockey. ESPN NHL Hockey has plenty of unlockables, including classic jerseys, teams, and goalie masks. There are even a couple of unlockable mini-games.</story>

Returning to his base, the player may purchase weapons, build up his army and customize his Majin or transform them to special items.

    <story>Evergrace is very basic, Japanese action RPG. As usual, player controls a young hero who eventually will save the world from the clutches of evil. The story takes two roads of two different heroes who run around fields killing monsters in real time action a bit like in Zelda games. The hook in this game, or not so much of a hook, but the thing that separates it from most of other RPG is that the characters don&apos;t level up. The power of character is measured by his equipment so when you get a better sword, you kinda level up that way. The weapons and equipment are also customizable so if you like playing with your tools, this is the game for you. This was the first RPG to appear on PS2 in Europe.</story>

You can move in all directions while progressing forward, shooting enemies and collecting power-ups and gold (which act as money you can use to buy items at a shop every time you beat a boss). You have the ability to lock-on enemies and fire powerful missiles at them, and you also have a laser (which recharges by itself after every use) you can launch by holding down the fire button. You can also send out nuclear bombs on the area which can clear all the enemies on-screen, and can also help in bosses. At the end of every level, you face a boss. Before a boss begins, a screen will show up telling you the weak-points of said boss. Successfully defeating a boss will take you to the item shop, where you can buy items to power up your robot, and then you will proceed to the next level.</story>

It can tell if a move is being performed correctly and gives personalised real-time feedback that is both encouraging and constructive. Over 200 separate Hung Gar Kung Fu moves have been motion captured using a leading martial arts expert and players need to stay within the instructors outline on screen to complete exercises and learn new techniques. As players&apos; journey through the four martial arts inspired zones they will face a number of challenges to test their new skills.

In this &apos;versus&apos; battle players will face a virtual opponent that they need to defeat to progress to the next zone. To provide a structured training schedule, Kinetic Combat has a Personal Trainer Mode that takes players through a 16 week programme. This programme ensures players benefit from an holistic approach that targets all the body&apos;s muscle groups whilst giving an comprehensive aerobic and anaerobic workout and thorough grounding in Hung Gar Kung Fu.

    <story>EyeToy- Monkey Mania is an ideal game for kids and their families. With board game style play you can spin the roulette wheel and move around the course of Bubble Island encountering penalty squares, traps, bonuses and all manner of unexpected obstacles. The game is full of cheeky monkeys who you must befriend and use as currency, but it&apos;s not always easy as you&apos;ll never know when they&apos;ll strike with their mischievous ways! Some of these squares will lead you to one of 50 fantastic and fun mini games. By using the EyeToy USB Camera you really can see yourself (and as many as three friends) on screen, games like bomb hockey enable you to smash the puck into your opponents net and knock their monkey characters off their feet! The EyeToy Camera projects the players onto the screens to physically interact with the characters and environments of the game in real-time and players can use any part of their body to control the action. The mini games can be played either on their own or from within the board game and are full of cheekiness synonymous with these monkeys, the games range from guiding a huge snowball along a mountain path, to running like the wind or jamming with your mates in a music session. You can even encourage your in-game character to eat his bananas in class and risk the wrath of the teacher! </story>

The level of detail on the visuals looks to be second to none, with each circuit boasting its own real-life structures, bumps in the track, motion-captured pit crews, animated grid girls, and planes and helicopters in the sky above. The cars in the game feature realistic driving physics and damage models that take into account the materials that the various components are made of. Fortunately, players have access to the same kind of data telemetry that real drivers and their teams do, so it should be possible to devise car setups that are appropriate for each circuit and so minimize the chances of crashing.</story>

    <story>In a post-apocalyptic future, a society known as the Brotherhood of Steel is born, wielding powerful weapons and armor from the time before the war, they seek to bring some form of order to the wastelands of what used to be the United States. As a new member(s) to the Brotherhood, you&apos;ll soon find yourself separated from your comrades and forced to contend with a variety of missions and challenges alone. Radscorpions, Super-Mutants and Deathclaws are all in the Brotherhood&apos;s way, and bringing an end to their tyranny will certainly make the wasteland a safer place. Brotherhood of Steel is an action themed shooter to the Fallout world. The Brotherhood members are well armed and carry full clips of ammo (which does run out). New weapons of various nature can be found and equipped to bring new tactics.

Additionally, your character will have to content with finding keys and other objects, protecting NPCs and jumping over bottomless pits.</story>

    <story>A simulation of the TV game show of the same name. Two families will compete against each other to choose the most common answers to questions such as Things a jockey needs, or Clothes that don&apos;t go on hangers. More than 1000 questions are included. The 2006 edition has both standard and quick games. The standard game contains 5 rounds. In rounds 1-4, two people are selected, one from each team, who compete to buzz in a common answer to the question on the board. The team that wins control then has to figure out the other common answers, earning a strike for any answers that are not common. If any common answers remain after that team&apos;s third strike, the other team has a chance to steal all the points for that round by guessing an unrevealed answer. In rounds 3 and 4, the stakes are higher. In round 5, two people from the winning team work together to find common answers to questions before time runs out. The quick game has just one family, who has to guess the common answers to a question. Finding all answers earns bonus points. The standard game can be played against the computer, another player on the same computer, or over the Internet. Answer questions by typing them out or using the on-screen keyboard; the computer will recognize word variations and some misspellings. A family editor is included, which lets you edit body type and clothing. By playing the game, new clothing options and studios will be unlocked.</story>

    <story>The Griffin family from Fox&apos;s animated TV series makes its way to video gaming for the first time. In this action-adventure, which runs like an episode from the show, players control Peter, Brian and Stewie through various goals and adventures. After being hit on the head by a satellite dish, Peter wakes up in a hospital believing that Mr. Belvedere (from the 1980&apos;s sitcom) has kidnapped his family, and everyone in town is an accomplice. Peter makes his way through town beating up anyone who gets in his path, in a side-scrolling beat-em-up fighting mode. Brian is falsely accused of impregnating Carter Pewterschmidt&apos;s prized racing dog Seabreeze. Brian must escape the police station without being seen and collect evidence proving that he is not the father. Brian&apos;s game mode relies heavily on stealth/espionage gameplay. Stewie&apos;s battle against his half-brother Bertram continues as Stewie must destroy everything in his path to infiltrate a hospital and the inside of Peter in order to find Bertram&apos;s lair and stop him from taking over the world. Stewie&apos;s adventure takes place as a platformer action game with shooting elements. Much like the show, there are segues which translate into mini-games that will yield power-ups for each mission if completed successfully.</story>

    <story>This game is a licensee of the 2005 movie Fantastic 4. Unlike many licensed titles, this third-person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay. Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka Doctor Doom as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few. The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials. To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.</story>

    <story>Miku Hinasaki is young girl with a strange sixth sense. Her brother, Mafuyu, and his mentor, Junsei Takamine, went to investigate a mansion that once was inhabited by a powerful landowner who had absolute control over the area. Unfortunately, they never returned from their investigation. Miku enters the mansion, armed with only an antique camera given to her by her deceased mother, to try to find her brother. While inside the mansion, Miku will encounter ghosts and other spiritual apparitions. In order to overcome these spirits and survive, she must use the magical camera to capture the ghosts on film, thereby trapping them forever. Ghosts range from invisible fragments hidden in scenery, to memories of the past that appear only for a moment before vanishing, to full body apparitions that will attempt to attack and kill Miku. In order to defeat an aggressive ghost the Camera Obscura&apos;s shot must first be charged by keeping the ghost centered while it is visible. If Miku snaps a shot while the ghost is attacking or is vulnerable then she will drain even more energy from it, resulting in more spirit points being earned. Points can then be spent to improve her camera&apos;s attributes or give it special abilities, like slowing a ghost or pushing it away. The Camera Obscura can also reveal clues and dispel illusions, which Miku will need to utilize to solve puzzles within the mansion. The Xbox Director&apos;s Cut rerelease contains eleven new ghosts (only one of which must be fought), new unlockable costumes, a new difficulty level, and an additional ending.</story>

Special abilities for the camera no longer require a disposable item, and are instead charged by taking good shots of attacking ghosts.

Here she is frightened by images of her dead fiancé. The game incorporates the camera mode from the previous games, used to capture ghosts. You use the camera obscura not only as a weapon to capture ghosts but as a guide by taking pictures of the ghosts and creepy objects in the house in order to solve the mystery and get rid of the curse. You walk around with a strobe light looking for clues to the mystery. Throughout the course of the game you can play as three women and switch between a dream world and real-life. All in all, it carries over the same Japanese horror theme as the first two.</story>

    <story>The 2008 edition of the long-running EA FIFA football franchise improves upon the gameplay and the features of the previous installments. It is the first game in the series to appear on the Wii and the PS3. Statistically, it includes 620 licensed teams, 30 national leagues (3 more than in FIFA Soccer 07), with the addition of the Hyundai A-League (Australia), Czech Gambrinus Liga (Czech Republic) and FAI Premier Division (Ireland). As usual, the leagues have been updated with new teams and prominent football countries (England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) have multiple divisions. There are also 23 clubs from around the world not featured in specific leagues. Gameplay changes include a revised shooting simulation, where factors such as position, defence, speed, bounce and direction weigh in. This is a continuation of the dynamic shooting meter from the previous version, where the position and a shot power meter make for powerful distance shots. There is also more attention to through-balls, more fluent animations and skill moves, revamped crowd, cheering and stadium animations, and a redesigned tackle system. Next to the known modes, Be A Pro is introduced where players take control of a single, fixed player on the field. It is not a career mode, but mainly an alternative way to play the games. Online multiplayer options allow players to form a team of independently controlled players, with 10 human-controlled players at the same time in a single match. The camera is changed for this mode, to constantly keep the specific player, but also the action in focus. FIFA Soccer 08 contains licensed music tracks from all around the world. Brazilian player Ronaldinho is the poster boy for this version, only replaced with prominent national players for specific localized versions, especially for the European countries. The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions include online interactive leagues, with full national leagues against other players on EA servers. The game also comes with the tools to set up independent multiplayer games and organize tournaments. The Wii version comes with the Footii Party mode, hosted by a Mii avatar of superstar Ronaldinho. Using the players&apos; Mii characters there are mini-games of Table Football and Shoot Off. Players can also unlock Ronaldinho to go head-to-head in a skill contest. The controls are completely different from the other versions, dubbed FreeMotion. Through 30 tutorials at the Football Academy, players learn to dribble, shoot, pass and perform tricks with a flick of the wrist. The same depth is offered as in the other versions, with crosses, through passes and distance shots.</story>

    <story>One of EAs best selling franchises sees another yearly update, just months after the release of UEFA Euro 2008. However, continuing with the improvements seen in previous games, the developers tweaked the game further, such as adding a new physics model, which brings more realism to collisions, but also increased responsiveness and goalkeeper AI and animations. Featuring thirty leagues and passing the half-thousand team mark, the game includes the usual modes seen in previous games, with enhancements to the Be a Pro mode, as well as a 10 vs 10 online mode. There&apos;s also a new paid premium mode, named Adidas Live Season, which tracked the real results of six of the biggest leagues, and changed player statistics according to their actual form.</story>

    <story>FIFA Soccer 11 is a licensed soccer game which allows the player to directly control his athletes. He has various playing modes to his disposal, e.g. single matches, multiplayer or leagues to prove his skill. The most important improvement to FIFA Soccer 10 is the so-called Personality+ feature which means that players have special attributes, e.g. poacher, which directly influences the variety of movements the player can use and their success rate on the field. The new passing system allows to set the amount of strength the athlete uses for his passing attempt. The career mode know includes the option to eventually become a manager or trainer - the player also can choose to play as goalkeeper for the first time. Other smaller changes are the possibility to incorporate own fan songs and the new penalty playing mode.</story>

    <story>FIFA Soccer 12 is a soccer game in which the player directly controls the athletes. As always, the game offers an extensive license package which allows the player to take control over a real-life team in a real-life championship. However, the career mode is the heart of the game- During up to 15 seasons the player brings his club to the top; either as manager, a single athlete or coach. Every role brings a different set of jobs and challenges to fulfill. The most notable changes in comparison to FIFA 11 (console version) include a new physics engine, a new defending system and the so-called Pro Player Intelligence which means athletes are aware of the skills of their athletes and base their decisions on that.</story>

    <story>Five game-changing innovations revolutionize artificial intelligence, dribbling, ball control and physical play to create a true battle for possession across the entire pitch, deliver freedom and creativity in attack, and capture all the drama and unpredictability of real-world football. All-new Attacking Intelligence infuses players with the most sophisticated artificial intelligence ever achieved. Players have the ability to analyse space, work harder and smarter to break down the defence, and think two plays ahead. Now every touch matters with the most comprehensive and intuitive dribbling system ever developed for the franchise. Inspired by the world’s best player, Lionel Messi, Complete Dribbling enables players to face their opponent and use precise dribble touches combined with true 360° mobility with the ball, so it’s easier to be more creative and dangerous in 1v1 opportunities. FIFA 13 1st Touch Control transforms the way players control the ball, eliminating near-perfect touch for every player on the pitch, and creating more opportunities for defenders to win back possession. The second generation of the Player Impact Engine expands physical play from just collisions to off-the-ball battles between players. Defenders can push and pull for position, and utilise their size and strength to force opponents into poor touches and decisions before the ball arrives. FIFA 13 Tactical Free Kicks provides the tools to create dangerous and unpredictable free kicks. Position up to three players over the ball and utilise dummy runs and more passing options to outwit your opponent. FIFA 13 delivers the largest and deepest set of game-changing features in the history of the franchise. Additional features and new modes will be revealed in the months ahead. </story>

    <story>Released only a few months after Euro 2004, FIFA 2005 brings several features to the franchise, such as the return of a player creation tool, where a player can be created from scratch from customizing the face (while it&apos;s not possible to define the texture like in previous EA Sports games such as NHL 2000, the player can customize the facial features such as shape of the eyes or the cheeks, in a way similar to RPGs such as Neverwinter Nights), accessories and playing abilities. It&apos;s also possible to create all kinds of competitions. The Career mode was also extended, allowing now up to 15 seasons, and giving the player the chance to turn the tide of a simulated match anytime. This mode is a light managerial mode, where the player not only plays, but also signs new players and increase the clubs abilities in trainers, medical staff and other club staff). The main gameplay change was the addition of First Touch controls. By performing one of the trick moves before the player gets possession of the ball it&apos;s possible to do a number of moves, such as touching the ball forward to gain a few yards ahead of the defenders or touch the ball to one side, and roll to the other of a rushing defender, and then pickup up the ball a bit ahead leaving the opponent stranded, and the inclusion of a fake shot move, which allows forwards to sit a goalkeeper before scoring in style or make defenders jump from their positions, opening room for a through pass or a run into goal. Other aspects of the game, such as the Off The Ball controls (allows the control of players that aren&apos;t in possession, moving them into an open position) remain unchanged. Another new feature is the FIFA Shop, where the player can trade points earned in many ways, from simple tasks like having a peek at the Jukebox to obtaining 10 victories in a row in Career mode, for several items, such as third jerseys, additional music, more balls and night stadiums. As it became the norm with the series, the game features 18 leagues and 38 national teams (some of these, due to licensing problems feature only generic kits and logos), summing up around 11&apos;000 real footballers.</story>

Fed up with consumerist American culture, a fight club is founded as a new type of therapy through bare-knuckle fighting. The game focuses on the fights and uses many characters and environments from the original story. You can create a new fighter or clone one of the generated characters. There are three general fighting styles to choose from- grappling, kung fu or brawling. The moves range from basic punches to devastating moves with broken bones, ripped clothes and real-time facial deformation. After each successful fight, you earn Character Development Points (CDP&apos;s) which can be used to upgrade or heal your character. Aside from the regular arcade, survival and training mode, there is a story mode in which you need to work your way up as a rookie to become a key player in Project Mayhem in a storyline very loosely based on the original plot. Both the PS2 and Xbox version have an online multiplayer mode as well. The game music has tracks by famous bands such as The Dust Brothers, Limp Bizkit, Korn and Queens of the Stone Age.</story>

You have the option of creating your own personalized boxer, and entering a career mode, where you start off on the lowest rung in dirty, rundown gyms, as you make your way up the ropes to become the undisputed champion. Throughout your career you will have to battle many enemies, all vying for the same title. As you play, you will be able to train, improving your boxer&apos;s stats.

Besides career mode, you have access to the standard modes. Fight Night 2004 features the Total Control system, which utilizes both sticks to give you complete percision over your boxer&apos;s moves. The right analog stick controls all the punching, and the left stick controls movement and defense/blocks. There are several unlockables available, all of which must be earned through career mode. You can buy new clothes, entrance music, even new girls to accompany you to the ring. The PlayStation 2 version of Fight Night 2004 supports online play via EA Sports&apos; online network. As with all other EA Sports titles, Fight Night 2004 utilizes the EA Sports Bio, which tracks your progress through all EA Sports games. The more games you play, the longer you play them, and the better you do translates into a higher Gamer Level. When you reach certain levels, you can unlock special rewards.</story>

    <story>Fighting Angels is a story-less 3D fighting game featuring an all-female cast. The game is a 1-on-1 fighting game with minor wrestling influences- players can freely move in all directions around the arena, the ropes surrounding the arena can be incorporated into the fighting, and there is ground-based grappling much like in wrestling. Each character has four attacks -- weak and strong punches and kicks -- which have three variations each. Besides normal attacks, there are so-called Sexy Attack, which are weaker than normal attacks but are much flashier and will build the character&apos;s Sexy Gauge. There are also Plain Attack, which are more traditional but drain the Sexy Gauge. If a character&apos;s Sexy Gauge is full, they&apos;ll have a chance to use a super-powerful Sexy Combo Attack, which is often powerful enough to completely drain the opponent&apos;s health. It is also possible to block and use a basic grab move, as well as pick up objects around the arena to use as weapons. The game includes a number of different modes. The main single-player mode is tournament mode, in which the player chooses a character and tries to defeat each computer opponent in order. There is also a standard versus mode for one or two players, a survival mode, and a practice mode. As is the standard for Tamsoft&apos;s Simple 2000 sports games, there is also a view mode where the player can dress and of the characters in any unlocked outfit and watch their animations from any angle.</story>

    <story>Tidus is a young athlete who lives in a futuristic city of Zanarkand - the city that never sleeps. He plays blitzball, a ball game where players throw the ball while flying around. Suddenly, a terrible disaster happens. A huge dark wave engulfs the city, spawning monsters. Tidus comes in contact with the mysterious creature, and as a result finds himself in a different world, 1000 years into the future. The civilization he is used to doesn&apos;t exist any more. He learns that the world he knew was destroyed by Sin, a terrible being that is believed to be indestructible. Tidus meets a young summoner named Yuna, and joins her as a guardian on her quest to put an end to Sin. Final Fantasy X is set in a world that is somewhat similar to South Asia. The game doesn&apos;t use the traditional level up system- instead, you receive sphere points after battles, and then upgrade your characters&apos; parameters while moving on a special sphere map. The ATB (active time battle) system is replaced by turn-based combat. The characters are given distinct class attributes, and you can switch between all your party members during the same battle. Summoned monsters (called aeons in the game) now behave like playable characters, have their own HP, and can fight for the party until defeated.</story>

    <story>Final Fantasy X-2 is the first direct sequel in the history of the series. The events of the game take place two years after Yuna and her guardians defeated Sin in Final Fantasy X, and peace was restored in Spira. Rikku (remember this cheerful Al-Bhed girl from the previous game?) finds a strange sphere that mysteriously shows an image resembling... Tidus, Yuna&apos;s one and only love! Rikku brings the sphere to Yuna, who now doesn&apos;t look any more like the shy, quiet girl we know from FFX, but rather like a cool action heroine in short pants and with a gun in each hand. Determined to discover the truth behind the mystery, Yuna organizes a journey of sphere-hunting, to find more spheres scattered around the world, and perhaps to find Tidus... The series underwent important changes in this game, especially gameplay-wise. The ATB (active time battle) system is back, after it had been replaced by turn-based combat in FFX. The battles develop at a quicker pace than earlier games in the Final Fantasy series, with more emphasis on quick decision and timing. You have a party of three characters- Yuna and her friends Rikku and Paine (yes, you control only girls in this game!). The job system similar to that of Final Fantasy V is back, with the possibility to learn various abilities and to freely customize your characters&apos; classes. Jumping and climbing are now possible in certain locations. Also, the gameplay is non-linear, untypically for console RPGs. Right from the beginning you have your airship, and you can explore the entire world at your pleasure.</story>

    <story>Final Fantasy XII is set in Ivalice, a fantasy world which also served as a setting for Final Fantasy Tactics. Two powerful empires, Archadia and Rozaria, are at war. All they care for is victory over the opponent. In order to achieve it more quickly, Archadia invades the small kingdom of Dalmasca. The young prince of Dalmasca falls in battle shortly after his marriage to the beautiful princess Ashe. The king is murdered under mysterious circumstances just before signing a peace treaty with Archadia. The iron rule of the empire is established in the small country... You take control of a young thief named Vaan who lives in Rabanastre, the capital city of Dalmasca. Through a series of events Vaan finds himself involved in the political struggle, hoping to avenge the death of his treacherously murdered brother. The game differs from its predecessors in many gameplay-related aspects. The traditional turn-based combat engine was replaced by free-flowing battles with real time elements, somewhat similar to western RPGs such as Baldur&apos;s Gate, or Knights of the Old Republic. You are unrestricted in your movements during battles, and there are no separate battle screens. You can issue specific commands to your party members, or assign to them combat strategies (called gambits). New magic, abilities, and items are bought from stores or found in containers in the world, but before a character can use any of it they have to buy a license for it by spending license points earned in combat. In addition to the enemies and bosses found by following the story the player can also accept Hunts posted in bars or offered to the player after they show off their prowess. These are optional encounters where the player has to track down and either trap or lure a very powerful monster before defeating it.</story>

As an earthquake shakes the very foundations of Finny&apos;s home stream, it also shakes the foundations of his fishy life. Now lead by Kappa, the protector of Finny&apos;s home, he must travel throughout the vast seas in order to meet the Masters and collect their statues. One of the most important parts of the game is the hunger meter. Finny must eat fish in order to survive, or else his hunger meter will deplete and he will gradually lose health. He is able to lock onto different fish with a targeting system. He can even eat fish that are larger than him by biting it a certain amount of time. However, he cannot eat lures. In order to escape from fishing humans, he must either break the fishing line or jump out of the water to unhook himself. He&apos;ll also need to avoid other dangers such as alligators and electric eels. The game keeps track of what fish he&apos;s eaten and what lures he&apos;s taken. Other than that, this game has many puzzles to be solved and people to help. You can collect one item at a time to bring them to people that need them. </story>

    <story>Fire ProWrestling Returns is a 2D-graphic based wrestling simulation game. The game has a north-south/east-west-axis movement system. This allows for dual-plane movement rendering it to play like a 3D wrestling game (although the moves are still done in 2D). The game features 327 wrestlers on the main roster, from over 10 major Japanese wrestling and mixed-martial arts organizations. This in-depth roster allows the player to simulate classic matches or matches that could never take place. Game modes include a standard exhibition match, tag team exhibition match with 2, 3 or 4 player teams, a round robin league tournament featuring up to 64 wrestlers, a sudden elimination tournament featuring up to 16 wrestlers, mixed martial arts matches aka Ultimate Fighting (with either Pride or K 1 Rules), battle royal matches with up to eight players in the ring at the same time, 5-man team elimination matches and for the first time ever in a Fire ProWrestling game, a North American cage match mode. The edit mode allows you to create wrestlers, referees and even entire wrestling organizations (with their own ring and logo). This mode features over 1,648 moves and holds you can assign to your wrestlers, and you can then tweak their CPU logic, so as to make them behave as you like when controlled by the computer. The new features for the Fire ProWrestling series debuting in Fire ProWrestling Returns are North American cage matches, face layering on edit mode, and ring seconds (aka managers) that accompany wrestlers to the ring. It also features over 20 brand new moves, including some reanimations of old moves.</story>

    <story>Fitness Fun is an exercise-themed rhythm game starring D3 Publisher&apos;s virtual idol Riho Futaba. Riho is putting on a special concerts for the 5th anniversary of her debut, and her manager has asked her to do dance aerobics training to perfect her rhythm. During each song, a cursor scrolls across a set of four bars with notes arranged on them in time with the music. The player must move the cursor to as many notes as possible, and press the button on the controller in time with the music to dance along. Play well, and Riho will stay with the rhythm and earn points, but play poorly and she will start to get out of breath. If too many wrong notes are played, the song will be failed and end early. Extra songs and costumes can be unlocked by beating preset scores in the Lesson mode. There are a total of 12 songs and 14 costumes to unlock. It is also possible to save replays of performances to watch later without the note bar obscuring the view of Riho. A highly popular pin-up model, has been instructed by her manager to develop a sense of rhythm in order to prepare for her 5th anniversary concert. Can she get through this tense moment of her career in one piece?! Will she be able to perfect her routine in time?! As the concert draws near, her anxiety grows. </story>

    <story>FlatOut is a driving game where crashing your car can be more fun than racing it. You drive muscle cars around dirt tracks, battle them on destruction derby arenas, and take part in Ragdoll Olympics. That last one may need some explanation. When you crash in FlatOut, your driver (the Ragdoll) is flung through the windscreen, very much like in Rekkaturvat. This feature is used in the Ragdoll sports where the task is to propel the hapless driver as far, as high, or as accurately as possible. On the demolition arena the goal is to wreck other cars before yours is. Simple as that. The bulk of the game is racing though and it can be performed in typical quick race and time trial modes in addition to the proverbial career mode. There are also two different handling modes for the cars. Normal mode gives arcade type handling, suitable for gamepads. Professional mode seems to be designed for steering wheel owners and provides very challenging simulator-type handling. Not surprisingly since Bugbear&apos;s previous racing title Rally Trophy was considered to be very challenging, even demanding, simulation. Bugbear&apos;s experience with simulation dynamics shows in FlatOut. Almost everything on the track can be run into and it behaves as it should in real life. Or at least as in a car-chase movie. Stuff that cars scatter around are there on the next lap too and cars are gradually dismantled when hit to other cars or solid objects around the track. Multiplayer modes are of course great party hits. Depending on platform, FlatOut has hotseat, split screen, LAN, and/or online multiplay modes.</story>

    <story>As in FlatOut your goal is to drive as reckless as you can and still win the race. But contrary to its predecessor, FlatOut 2 is now a complete arcade-racing game. The core of the game is the career mode which features 3 different racing-classes- Derby, Race and Street. Every class is also divided into 3 levels. You begin your career in the derby class level 1. Here you drive old, wrecked cars straight from the dump. As you progress to the race class and finally to the street class you can buy better and faster cars which you can then also tune to your needs, like installing a new engine. Inside the classes you find different kinds of events- from normal races over Destruction Derbies to stunt events. All of the events feature a fully destructible environment. This is not only eye-candy but is also required to fill up your nitro and handicap your enemies. If you get bored of that, you can play one of the 12 mini-games. Like in FlatOut your goal here is to do all kinds of crazy stuff with your driver. You can use him as a football, throw him through burning rings and more. These mini-games can also be played with up to 8 players on one PC in a hot-seat mode.</story>

    <story>In The Flintstones- Bedrock Bowling, Fred Flintstone is toiling away as usual at his thankless construction job. When it&apos;s quitting time, his boss threatens him with summary termination if he does not finish his trench-digging assignment by the next morning. The biggest dilemma for Fred is that he needs to practice for an upcoming bowling tournament. The benevolent alien named The Great Gazoo materializes and solves the problem by digging a trench and lining it with giant bowling pins. He then gives Fred a large bowling ball half shell in which to play live action bowling. The action in Bedrock Bowling takes the form of steering the bowling shell down 8 different lanes. Each lane has 10 pins that the player must try to hit. Additionally, there are many diamonds, birds, and other powerups along the way to be collected for points. The 8 lanes are Gravel Factory, Quarry, Flooded, Tar, Freeway, Crystal Mine, Lava, and Rockzilla. </story>

The sequel adds new features in the game, which most notably you will notice, apart from the original Shibito zombies, as the new Yami Bito demons. The sequel also has a new alert system which functions through the controller&apos;s vibration function and alerts you of any nearby danger. Stealth plays an important role, as well as light and darkness, as the creatures are sensitive to it in different ways. Just like in the previous game, you can sight-jack enemies and animals, to view the environment through their eyes. There are over 30 weapons to collect and there are three difficulty options.</story>

    <story>Ford Bold Moves Street Racing is the third Razorworks-developed title in the licensed Ford Racing series since they took over development in Ford Racing 2. Unlike its predecessors, this version has an urban atmosphere. The road races, off-road challenges and circuit tracks have been removed and the action has been taken entirely to the streets of Los Angeles, with 24 tracks available. As in the previous version, the 18 available cars are all Fords, ranging from the 1968 Mustang GT to the 2007 Shelby GT 500. There are 4 main modes- Quick Race, Team Racing, Solo Racing and Multiplayer. Solo Racing offers quick races, and championships where new vehicles and tracks can be unlocked. The real novelty is the Team Racing mode, split up in single races, team championships, challenges and tutorials. Team Racing has the player control two or three vehicles in a single team during a race in modes such as Race, Elimination or Duel. The team with the highest point total wins, so the player either has to switch between the vehicles to drive (the others cars then become AI-controlled) or issue orders such as Block (slow down another vehicle) or Draft (additional speed in the slipstream) to influence the driving behaviour of the team mates. This can be extended to double or even triple actions of the same effect. Blocked cars have to brake and weave across the track until they regain control. Racing or completing challenges earns credits, which can be spent to buy new vehicles in the showroom. Despite the urban theme, there are no tuning options. Cars can only be viewed, repaired and sold. The PSP version adds 6 new Ford cars (1962 Thunderbird Sports Roadster, 1971 Mustang Mach 1, 2004 Bronco Concept, 2005 Shelby GR-1 Concept, 2005 SVT Sport Trac Adrenalin Concept, 2005 Thunderbird) and 7 new tracks. In the Team Racing mode, two cars can be controlled (3 in the console versions) and solo and team multiplayer is supported over Wi-Fi. There is also an alternate Australian PS2 release Ford Street Racing (XR Edition), with 4 additional cars synonymous with the history of Ford in Australia- the 1970 Ford XY GT Falcon, the 1970 Ford XY GTHO Falcon (Phase III), the 2003 Falcon XR8 Ute and the Australian Falcon XR8. That version is also the only PSP version released in Australia.</story>

Then choose the Single Player to race with computer opponents or Multi Player for head-to-head competition with a friend. Select from different background music types (rock, funk etc.) to further customize your experience. Views can be toggled between 1st and 3rd person perspective. On screen in the first person view, the speedometer, tachometer, rear view mirror, are shown as well as a map on left side showing your current location and nearby competitors. Classic car dash panels differ from more modern cars, too. Depending upon your perspective, you&apos;ll see your lap times, overall position, rpms and speed.</story>

    <story>Freak Out- Extreme Freeride is an arcade skiing game, focused on performing tricks and stunts. The main mode is Mission, where players need to jump gaps, make tricks, grind rails and pick stars. Completing the different challenges is rewarded with money, exchanged for basic equipment (skis, boots, helmets) and style equipment (jackets, goggles, gloves) at the shop. It also opens up new slopes and mountains. In Freeride the aim is to get the highest score, opening up slopes and mountains, there are four mountains in total, and earning endurance points. Bone Ride has the player collect bones against a time limit to earn balance points and beating courses in the Slope Style mode requires the player to reach a pre-defined score to receive trick skill points. These different game modes are grouped in the main Career, Single race and Multiplayer sections. Mostly about tricks, players need to take care of their landings - touch the ground with back, front or side weight and a lower score multiplier is awarded. Next to the basic information on the screen such as time, score and stunts, the game also keeps track of your flow, by doing consecutive tricks. There are six different characters and the arsenal of tricks includes flips, rolls, carve/cross skis, grabs, rails, jumps and specials.</story>

    <story>Freekstyle is a EA Sports&apos; take on motocross racing. This game is all about going fast and doing cool tricks. There are essentially two games here- first there is a straightforward racing game, where you race three laps around a circuit and attempt to finish first. The second part of the game is a freestyle competition, where you perform tricks to score points, and attempt to rack up the biggest total. The racing game, or Freekstyle mode, combines racing and tricks. You will race around a circuit track, and attempt to perform tricks at the big jumps you encounter along the way. Performing tricks fills your boost meter, which then gives you a speed boost you can use at your discretion. If you perform enough tricks, eventually you can break into freakout mode, where you can travel at ludicrous speed. Freekstyle features the voices and likeness of several real-life motocross stars.</story>

It is structured somewhat like the Tony Hawk series with a career mode that is a succession of levels, each one containing goals like doing specific tricks, finding gaps and finding things, which could take the form of breaking windows, running people over, etc. In this case, there are also racing goals. Each goal gives you money, which can be used to unlock new riders, bikes and levels. Controls consist of an accelerator, brake and clutch along with jump, trick and trick modifier buttons. The modifier can be used to turn a superman into a nothing superman, for instance. Wheelies are controlled with the right analog stick.</story>

Once you have completed each track, you are free to jam and mix freely with all tracks of the song in bass, rhythm, vocals, etc. Each song is broken down into 8 tracks and there are dozens of progressivley more difficult dance songs by major names such as Crystal Method, BT, Juno Reactor, Paul Okenfold, Orbital, Jungle Brothers, DJ QBert, and No Doubt.</story>

    <story>In the year 2096, the Wanzer (Walking Tanks mecha) form the backbone of many military forces. The European Community is enjoying a period of relative peace when it is surprised by sudden attacks on German bases from a mysterious force. To investigate, it is decided to send the EC Armor Tactics Research Corps, also known as Durandal. Inside the Durandal, a young new recruit, Elsa soon finds herself caught in an international plot. Meanwhile, the nation of Venezuela, is attempting to secede from the Unified Continental States (U.C.S.). UCS Forces are sent in to restore order and dispose of Governor Diaz. During a routine patrol, Sgt. Darril and his patrol witness a cargo plane being shot down. Heading to investigate, they soon discover it was a plane carrying part of Diaz&apos;s gold. For demoralized UCS soldiers like Darril, this smells like opportunity... Front Mission 4 is a turn based strategy game where the plot switches between two different theaters of operation- Elsa and Darril. Controlling the wanzer forces of either character, the story progresses simultaneously. Most battles take place on an overhead map divided into a Player phase and an Enemy phase. Typically a wanzer can move once and use his remaining Action Points (AP) to fire on the enemy or use an ability. Success in battle earns Experience Points, which are traded in for new abilities, such as Rapid Fire or Evasion bonuses. Each character has a set limit of Skill slots, which are filled up differently by abilities. While each character starts with a preference in skills, there is no limitation on what any pilot can learn. Money, found during on the map (along with items) or earned after a successful battle, can be used to upgrade wanzers and purchase new weapons.</story>

    <story>Full Spectrum Warrior- Ten Hammers is the successor of Full Spectrum Warrior. Although you killed the tyrant of Zekistan in the first game, the situation hasn&apos;t improved. A civil war begins to unfold and various insurgencies fight against the Western forces. Even ethnic hostilities erupt in violence. So once again squads of US Light Infantry are send into the country to secure the Tien-Hamir (or Ten Hammers) Province. But this time they can call upon the assistance of the British elements of the Coalition Forces. Like in Full Spectrum Warrior you are the commander of two Fire Teams called Alpha and Bravo. But now you can brake down a Fire Team to a Buddy Team consisting of the Team Leader with the Automatic Rifleman and the Grenadier with the Rifleman. In some missions you also have now access to a Bradley Fighting Vehicle which you control just like you control a fire team. In some missions you&apos;ll also find tanks or APCs which your Fire Teams can enter and use. You can now also give orders to a specific teammate. So if you want to breach a door, you order the Grenadier to unpack the rocket launcher and make a nice hole. It is also possible to give orders to the Fire Team you don&apos;t control right now. Unlike the first game, Ten Hammers doesn&apos;t feature a separate tutorial but you rather learn how to play in the very first mission. The twelve missions of the campaign feature several different objectives like reaching a convoy or destroy a street barrier. Since your squads can now enter buildings you have a whole new tactical layer to use against the many foes that hide in the shadows ready to kill you. To support this new feature, you can now also deploy a sniper in a building and activate the sniper mode in which you can take out the enemies one by one. The multiplayer-mode also got updated and features now the ability to play cooperatively with four friends or do a few 2-on-2 objective based missions.</story>

    <story>In Full Spectrum Warrior, you take on the role of commander of two squads of the United States military, Alpha and Bravo, as you guide them in the fictional country of Zekistan on a mission to capture or kill the terrorist Al Afad. In the game, you don&apos;t directly control your troops. You don&apos;t take aim at a target and shoot, and you don&apos;t circle-strafe around enemies. Instead, you tell your squad what to do, and they&apos;ll do it. It&apos;s like a real-time strategy game. You can tell your two squads to do numerous things, such as hide behind a wall, take cover behind a car, lob a grenade, fire off a rocket, or attack a target. You will need to utilize both squads to be successful. For example, you can have Alpha squad hide behind a car and lay down covering fire at a target that you can&apos;t directly kill, giving Bravo squad cover so they may cross open terrain, and get into a position where they will be able to kill the enemy. The game takes place in one locations, a Middle Eastern country, that&apos;s split up into several areas. You&apos;ll have to make your way through parks, an airport, city streets, and even some buildings. Throughout the country are many terrorists, all of whom are trying to kill you. You have four members on each squad; the Team Leader, Automatic Rifleman, Grenadier and Rifleman. Each plays a unique role. Full Spectrum Warrior supports Xbox Live, where two players can play through the single player campaign. Instead of controlling both squads, one player controls Alpha while the other controls Bravo.</story>

His mission- defending the evil industrial magnate Saber who manipulates home appliances and uses them as weapons. Not surprisingly these are the main foes in this game. But Darwin is not even close to helpless- various guns and gadgets, e.g. a jet pack, a electronic whip or a grappling hook, are used to dispatch of them. Most of the time is spent in fights but there are also puzzles. Many of them require the usage of Mooch, a fly. It can be summoned at any time and is able to reach high grounds, to deactivate electronic devices, to fly through small holes and even to slow down time to pass through fast moving obstacles. During the course of the game the player can find computer chips and hidden disks. On one hand these can be used to refresh ammo and health or to upgrade weapons. There is also the option to switch to a infrared view and scan objects. This rewards additional information.

The gameplay is similar to Neo Contra with a behind the back view where the player uses a variety of weapons including machine guns and rocket launchers and the Delta 6 Accelerator Suit that makes the player invulnerable for a short period of time. Using these weapons and accessories the player must fight his way through a horde of enemies including soldiers, tanks and jet fighters, along with the standard end of level bosses. The player can choose from 12 different Joes, but only a certain set at the beginning and unlocking more for completing missions, each with their own weapon and strengths depending upon their rank (Commandos are great at close range, Heavy Weapons are good at shooting from long distances while Soldiers are a mix of both), along with using various vehicles scattered throughout the stages. The game also features a two-player drop-in/drop-out co-op option that allows a friend to join a game at any time, however during gameplay without a human ally, the computer&apos;s A.I. will take over for the second on-screen soldier.</story>

    <story>G1 Jockey a horse racing game with two game modes, a single player story mode and a one or two player trial mode in which the player(s) just compete in random races without the career progression. In story/career mode the player starts as a novice jockey alongside two other AI jockeys and joins a stable. Each week they bid to take part in races aiming to end the year with the Rookie Of The Year contest after which they progress through successive to become Leading Jockey. The game is, in a way, endless because achieving leading Jockey status is not the end of the game - the player can continue playing season after season after season ... Very early on the player acquires an agent who gives advice on tactics and career development. The player is not guaranteed races on good horses until they have experience. Initially they must bid for races on unproven horses and impress the trainers by finishing higher in the standings than predicted. All races are viewed from the traditional rear, &apos;jockey&apos;s backside&apos; point of view though the L1/R1 buttons do provide a sideways view and, when held down continually a rear view. During the race the player has to balance four things - the overall speed of the horse, the stamina, horse motivation, and the potential, which affects for how long the horse can keep the speed high after all stamina was lost. By using the whip on both left and right the horse can be raised to it&apos;s &apos;Go&apos; state - motivated for the final surge. The game boasts over two thousand unique horses, and sixty five AI opponents each season</story>

While most other racing games have the player controlling a motorized vehicle (such as a car or a powerboat), or using physics to move closer to the goal (skiing, sailing and so on), in G1 Jockey the player is controlling an animal, which makes it slightly different from other racing games in the market. The player has to balance four things - the overall speed of the horse, the stamina, horse motivation, and the potential, which affects for how long the horse can keep the speed high after all stamina was lost - crucial for the last stretch sprint. It&apos;s impossible to raise all four at once, so players must have a well defined strategy to succeed. Depending on their abilities, each horse might be better suited for a particular strategy or type of race, and each must be treated differently to achieve the best possible result. The game features a large roster of horses, and many tracks to choose from, including flat track and steeplechase races. Game modes include race training, a tutorial, two player mode, and the career mode, where the player starts as a rookie jockey, and must complete races and training sessions to attract the attention of better stables.</story>

You’ll be able to choose from a large selection of more than 50 cars, with which you’ll race against nine others on land and water. In order to make your car suitable for the game’s many hazards, a trip to the body shop is recommended. Here, players can outfit their racers with a variety of car modifications. Aspects such as tyres and steering can be altered and gearboxes, breaks and engines can be tweaked for maximum performance as well. Varying weather conditions can make races a little unpredictable, but it’s the racing skills of the player and decisions in the garage that will make the difference between victory and failure.

    <story>Gaelic Games- Hurling is the officially licensed game of the Gaelic Athletic Association. Hurling is a fast-paced Gaelic sport that is played with sticks (the hurley) and a ball (the sliotar). Gaelic Games- Hurling includes all 32 County teams, over 300 Club teams, and 12 major stadiums, including Croke Park, Casement Park, Parnell Park, St Tiernach&apos;s Park, Semple Stadium, O&apos;Moore Park, Hyde Park, Fitzgerald Stadium, Pairc U Chaoimh, and Parc Tailteann.

Use the Single Match summary screen to set your favourite team and then randomise the other settings; such as home and way teams, stadium, weather, and rules. Mission mode allows you to take up the challenge and feel the pressure with these historical matches. Each mission has a handicap that a team must overcome; from seemingly impossible score deficits, to slim leads with seconds left on the clock. Manager mode takes you from season to season, with features including a new calendar view of the fixtures, new training to guide your players’ development, season stats for all the players in the league, and leaderboards for all stats categories. The extensive team editing functions in the game allow you to edit the names of the County team players, and to edit all details of the Club teams; including the team name, uniform style and colours, and the names, appearance, and details of each of the players. The game also includes support for the Cameo EyeToy and Digimask that allows a player to put his/her head into the game on top of one of the players. Four-player multiplayer is supported using the PS2 multitap. The game comes with the Official GAA Hurling / Football skills DVD.

    <story>Galerians- Ash continues directly the story told in the first Galerians. 500 years into the future, an ultra-intelligent mother computer named Dorothy was given the responsibility of managing humans&apos; lives. However, the computer&apos;s mind told her the humans must be destroyed as weak, imperfect beings, and a race of super-humans, the Galerians, must be created. But Rion, the hero of the first game, destroyed Dorothy in a dramatic battle. Now Rion is brought back to life and learns that Dorothy was able to execute a destructive program before her death. Once again, Rion must face and defeat Dorothy&apos;s creations, the Galerians. Galerians- Ash is an action-adventure along the lines of Resident Evil and other survival horror titles. Rion can fight enemies using various psychic techniques. The more he uses a technique, and the more damage he sustains, the more addicted he becomes, and when the addiction meter reaches the limit, his hit points get gradually depleted, and he cannot walk normally anymore. Like in other survival horror games, you rely heavily on healing and restoring items. Enemies also drop items that would raise Rion&apos;s maximum hit points or make his weapons stronger, in a RPG-like fashion.</story>

    <story>Gallop Racer 2001 is the first in the series to make it&apos;s appearance on the PlayStation 2 console. The player can partake in a simulation where, as an owner of a stable, they can buy, sell, retire and breed various race horses throughout their career while training and conditioning them along the way. The player will start out with a small amount of Jockey Points that act as currency in this game, using this to start out their stable by buying a horse and entering them in races. Depending how well their horses and jockeys perform during races, they can continue to expand their empire and become the best in the business. Not only can the player act as an owner, on race day they can also become the jockey and use their horses strengths to win races in a variety of tracks. The player must play to their horse&apos;s strengths and avoid exposing their weaknesses through various weather conditions. If the player and horse does well enough, the horse&apos;s attributes can change after the match, but also be affected negatively if they do poorly. There is also a Practice mode where the player can learn how to play the game through the various modes and even have the ability to bet on horse races, however this can only be done on this mode. Players can also go head-to-head in a split-screen, either with default horses or ones from their season mode.</story>

    <story>Garfield is taking his nap, as usual, when he is awakened by the dog Odie. From the corner of his eye, he gets a glimpse of his pal Arlene, being taken away in a pound car. Despite his natural laziness, he decides to rescue his on-and-off girlfriend, along with Odie. Based on the comics and incorporation the known sense of humour, Garfield and Odie travel through a 3D world solving puzzles that involve doors, keys, but also team-based actions with your partner. Of course there are enemies to defeat, such as bad dogs and evil piranhas. Next to the regular moves, Garfield can also gain special powers based on his eating habits- big burger kicks, healing lasagna, etc. You cannot control Odie, who is invincible, directly, unless a second players hops in, but you can give him orders by whistling or kicking him. You can even travel over water by standing on his head. During gameplay, important story elements are told through comic strip-style panels to show you what Garfield cannot see (for instance to show you a switch between a well, or a hidden door). You can then take the appropriate action (it usually involves kicking Odie) to solve these problems.</story>

    <story>A port of the arcade game, Gauntlet- Dark Legacy is the follow-up to Gauntlet- Legends and another installment in the long-running Gauntlet series of hack-and-slash action games. As with all the Gauntlet games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal. This version contains the characters and levels from Gauntlet- Legends, plus the new characters and levels from the Dark Legacy arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in. There are eight characters to initially choose from- the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you&apos;ll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there are some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes. Unlike the early Gauntlet arcade games, the camera angle varies from location to location, from bird&apos;s eye to nearly ground level. The lands, creatures, and heroes are all rendered in 3D. While the graphics have been upgraded, the game play is very similar. You basically run around levels, hacking at what seems like unlimited armies of monsters, searching for gold, keys, and health-giving food...as well as a way out of the level. Bosses and other scripted events slow down the repetitious nature of the originals. While levels can be gained and characters saved, Gauntlet- Dark Legacy is an action game with some RPG trappings and should not be confused with the more true types from that genre.</story>

    <story>Gauntlet is back for yet another iteration. The Emperor has crucified his four loyal heroes to a magic tree, driven by a maniac thirst for their immortality. Hundreds of years later, as only a ghost, he came to regret all the wrong deeds he has done and frees them, asking them to defeat his six former advisors in an attempt to undo what he has done. This version of Gauntlet goes back to the roots- The warrior, valkyrie, elf, and wizard fight their way through hordes of enemies to make their way to the six bosses. The game is mostly a hack&apos;n&apos;slash affair, puzzles are limited to finding keys and pressing buttons that open doors and portals. Every character has a unique set of moves and attacks- The warrior has rather powerful attacks, the valkyrie has quick moves, the elf can shoot powerful arrows, and the wizard has several magical range attacks. Defeating enemies gives you experience points that may be used to increase your three stats; some chests in the levels contain better armor or weapons. Also, new moves can be purchased with gold. The game can be played both in single-player as well as cooperative multi-player, where up to four players fight together. The newest feature of this game (other than the much better graphics) is the online gaming feature. Played online, the game is identical to a regular multiplayer game, with each player on a different box.</story>

    <story>Genji- Dawn of the Samurai is a third-person action role-playing game (RPG) set in medieval Japan around the 12th century. At the time, a clan called the Heishi has conquered most of Japan through supernatural means. These means refer to magical stones called the Amahagane which bring supernatural powers (called the Kamui) to the wearers. The hero of this saga is a young man called Yoshitsune, a samurai who also possesses an Amahagane. The game starts when young Yoshitsune is attacked by the Heishi as they are searching for other Amahagane stones. The fate of the world depends on those who controls these magical stones and at that moment, the Heishi seem invincible as they posses most Amahagane. Later in the story, the player acquire a second hero, the giant warrior monk Benkei, who also owns an Amahagane. The story then revolves around the struggles of these two unlikely heroes against the tyranny of the Heishi clan. Gameplay is standard click-and-slash action. The player may either control Yoshitsune or Benkei in alternating turns. The unique side of this game is the use of the Amahagane, enabling the player unleash powerful blows at the enemy, particularly useful against multiple foes. The more powerful the Amahagane, the slower enemies become when the Amahagane is activated. Timing is of the essence as the player must attack at the exact moment indicated by the game or the move will fail.</story>

The player takes control over one of twelve contestants which all live in a free accessible apartment. Every twenty days they are judged by a jury and the worst one gets eliminated from the show. The judgment is based on three character stats- styling, self confidence and popularity. Popularity gets improved by talking with the other contestants. Here the player has to choose between three sentences, two mean and a nice one. Of course just the nice one improves the stat. The styling is divided into clothes, make up and hairstyle. In each one the player receives a reference and needs to shape his model after it. Then this gets judged by the game and it tells one false aspect. Every try costs one day. The last stat, self confidence, gets raised by answering trivia questions about fashion styles and successful photo shoots. These are mini games where the player needs to emulate movements with his input device.</story>

    <story>Get On Da Mic is a karaoke game based exclusively on Hip-Hop songs. Players have to sing along with the songs as a version plays sung by an amateur singer and the lyrics scroll along on the screen. The singer&apos;s voice is adapted based on the player&apos;s timing, pitch is not taken into account. The songs are not sung by the original performers, but re-recorded. Scoring is based on the overall timing of the words. The words do not have to be sung correctly. It also registers when random noises are made as long as the timing is correct. As it mostly consists of rap songs, there is a bar and spacing between the words to provide help with the lyrical flow, along with a moving color highlighting the words. Songs can be sung in three difficulty levels. When performing well, a meter is filled up until the rock the mic sequence is activated, adding snow to the location or money falling from the sky. In the main career mode the player has to make his way up to sing in better venues (starting in the bathroom) with eleven in total. Money earned along the way can be spent on items to customize the character or to buy a mansion and decorate it. Other modes are exhibition (sing any song) and practice (similar to exhibition but without scoring). In the freestyle mode players can rap freely over the beats without the regular vocals. There is also a multiplayer freestyle mode where another player uses the controller to judge the freestyle. There are different characters to choose from, each with their own poses and animations.</story>

    <story>It&apos;s going to be a day to remember for Sgt Mitchell. His first shift back on the MET&apos;s Organised Crime Squad begins with a dawn raid on a council estate that turns nasty. The next 48 hours will put him against the suspicions of his team mates, a new ruthless wave of crime and the most powerful man in London. Meanwhile on the other side of the city, amateur boxer Eddie O&apos;Conner is in severe trouble. The bank job went horribly wrong, his small-time crew has been wiped out and his only ally in this whole mess is Sam, a teenage thief more comfortable with nicking laptops than gang violence. Eddie knows he&apos;s way out of his depth, now his friends are dead and somebody is going to pay... The game is split into sections. Once you complete Sgt Mitchell&apos;s part, you get to play as Eddie. You play the same story, but view it from two different angles. Some events that look vague when played from Mitchell&apos;s side get explained when controlling Eddie. Some portions of the game are playing using Sam, providing yet another piece of the puzzle. The gameplay is divided into driving and shooting/sneaking parts. Usually you receive a mission, drive to a certain destination, and then shoot (or sometimes sneak) your way to the goal. London has been digitally recreated for this game, and you can drive through it freely. As Eddie, you&apos;ll have to avoid police and rivaling gangs chasing you. You can hijack cars and even buses. You can also leave a car at any time and run through London on foot. For the shooting parts, there is a variety of moves you can perform- sneaking, hiding, crouching, rolling to the sides, etc. You can knock your enemies down by using your gun&apos;s butt as a melee weapon or take pedestrians hostage to prevent the policemen from killing you. Eddie also has unarmed boxing moves to help you fight your way out of trouble, and Sam has the ability to get out of trouble by climbing out of the way, or sneaking under objects to hide.</story>

    <story>Ghost in the Shell- Stand Alone Complex is an action game based on the television series of the same name. The game takes place in the year 2030; you control the cyborgs Motoko Kusunagi and Batou, members of the secret government agency Section 9 with the mission of fighting terrorism and crime. Gameplay is from a 3rd person perspective; you will need to fight, jump and climb your way through twelve missions, with the story unfolding in full motion video between missions and communications received during a mission. There are many different weapons available for use, and after defeating enemies you may be able to pick up extra ammo or weapons; occasionally you will also acquire a hacking key. With this, you will be able to see the location of other enemies in the area onscreen. You will also be able to attempt to hack certain enemies; when attempting to hack, two spinning rings appear on the screen. If you successfully match up the ring patterns, you will be able to control the enemies actions. Computer terminals can also be found in many areas allowing you to hack into enemies. The game can be played on three difficulty levels, and a multiplayer mode is available where up to four players can compete.</story>

    <story>Ghost Master- The Gravenville Chronicles is the console version of the PC game Ghost Master. In this strategy game, you become the scourge of humanity by managing haunting teams consisting of various ghosts. The levels, usually inspired by famous scenes from horror movies, require you to scare mortals and complete additional objectives such as freeing trapped ghosts. Deployed ghosts need to be bound to certain objects, called fetters, that match their type. By scaring humans, you collect plasm, the main resource in the game. Plasm can be used to recruit new ghosts, or expand their abilities. Rather than deploying a massive amount of creatures, the game rewards creative use of limited resources to haunt mortals in original ways. Each human has a believe meter. An important aspect is figuring out each human&apos;s weakness. As you exploit this, they become more susceptible to various phenomena and provide more plasm. Along the way, you will meet fierce resistance as ghostbreakers, priests and witches can detect and ban your ghosts. The game is not a direct port. Instead, Spiral House was contracted to modify the original codebase by Sick Puppies to make it more user-friendly for the consoles. This includes a complete overhaul of the interface to make commands easier to access, the introduction of battle elements - next to the regular missions - to speed up the game&apos;s pace, a more linear game structure, and a redesign of the control over ghosts. They now have less AI and there is more variety in the types, requiring you to tap wisely into the plasm pool to deploy the most adequate ghost for each situation.</story>

You are Johnny Blaze, who sold his soul to a demon named Mephisto for noble reasons. Now, some rogue demons have escaped from hell and Mephisto needs to to destroy them before they cause him trouble. If you don&apos;t, he&apos;ll take your girlfriend back to hell with him. Ghost Rider attacks with his flaming hellfire chains in a manner similar to God of War. If he uses a variety of moves and avoids being hit, it fills a vengeance bar. The more this meter fills, the more souls he gets from enemies he kills. Souls are used to purchase new moves and extras like additional characters. There are some shielded enemies where you must have a minimum vengeance bar to damage them. There is also a spirit gauge, which is essentially a special meter and is also built up by attacking. It allows the uses of special moves, like your shotgun. There are also Hellcycle levels, where you must successfully avoid obstacles while destroying enemies with the bike&apos;s hellshots attacks and your chains.</story>

    <story>An official sequel to the two Ghostbusters movies, Ghostbusters- The Video Game puts the player in control of Rookie, the unnamed newest member of the Ghostbusters. Shortly after being hired a mysterious ghostly shock wave flows through New York City, prompting the Ghostbusters to begin an investigation. Over the course of the game they will return to many locations from the movies and meet returning characters as well as some new locations and characters. As the Rookie the player must explore levels to find and capture any ghosts while being assisted by fellow Ghostbusters following you. A ghost must first be weakened using any of the proton pack weapon modes it is vulnerable to, then by dragging the stunned ghost to a trap placed by the player or their teammates. Other enemy types must be defeated by first revealing a weak point and then pulling it out with the proton pack&apos;s blast stream, or by simply dealing enough damage to the enemy. If the Rookie takes too much damage themselves they will be knocked unconscious, and their allies will attempt to get to them and help them back up. The Rookie can do the same if any of their allies are knocked unconscious, and if all current members of the team are knocked down the game will return to the last checkpoint. Information about enemies and objects in the world can be obtained by scanning them, and concept art for the entries can be added by finding hidden pages in the levels. The Rookie receives upgrades to their proton pack automatically over the course of the game, and by finding enough scanner entries they can increase their health. Ghostbusters- The Video Game on the Wii and PS2 shares the same story, level settings, and most of the dialogue of the XBOX360/PS3/Windows version, but it also has several departures. Levels are condensed, redesigned, and occasionally completely removed. The art assets were changed to a cartoon-like style, and some bosses were redesigned as a result. While this version lacks an online mode, the Wii release does allow two players to play through story mode in co-op, something impossible in the high definition version. Finally the player has the option of playing a female Rookie, although this has no impact on the story (and some characters still refer to the Rookie as being male).</story>

After unwittingly unleashing hundreds of ghosts from a containment facility, including one that took a liking to Lazarus&apos; partner, it&apos;s now his job to travel to the four corners of the earth and recapture them. This is going to be one long night. Lazarus starts the game with a pistol, but bullets aren&apos;t much use against the incorporeal. Eventually he will find energy weapons that can drain away a ghost&apos;s energy, and when a ghost has been sufficiently weakened it can be captured with Lazarus&apos; homing Ghost Grenade. Not all the monsters Lazarus faces are the undead, however, and more solid foes can be dispatched the traditional way- shooting them until they stop moving. Levels are traveled through sequentially and range from flooded bayous to a sunken battleship and abandoned prison island. Sometimes Lazarus will be assisted by a mute ghost named Astral who can reach areas beyond Lazarus and open paths for him. She has to be careful however as she has no way to attack or defend herself.</story>

    <story>On a far away planet, three races fight for control of the few landmasses available- the marooned Meccs, who specialize in firearms and other things that go boom, the mystical and cold-blooded Reapers, who were the original inhabitants of the planet, but were forced to live in the sea by Kabuto, the third character; a truly gigantic monster with a ravenous appetite and a fondness for performing wrestling maneuvers on those the size of his hand. You can control any of these races (although in the single player mode, you have to progress through the storylines of the Meccs and Reapers first) in their bid to be the dominant species. Each species various in the way they play the game and have vastly different types of attacks available to them. Giants is a action/real-time-strategy game that emphasizes action. While there is base-building and resource management for most of the races, it is a done through a simple to control interface and one or two keystrokes. The majority of the game will be spent in a third person view (first person mode is available) jet-packing/warping/leaping about the well rendered 3D landscape. Single player sessions consist of missions with specific goals, such as resucing Smarties or recovering lost items. Multiplayer options include standard deathmatch, capture the Smartie (flag), the above with basebuilding as an option. Other creatures also inhabit the islands. From the meek Smarties (who are employed to build your bases or eaten as a primary source of protein, depending on your species), to the cow-like vimps to the deadly rippers, the fauna of the planet will either try to kill you or avoid being killed/eaten/captured. While not so energetic, the floral of the islands can be crushed, knocked over, or burned in careless combat (or by Kabuto not paying attention). Game controls are similar to Shiny&apos;s MDK and can best be described a simplified shooter interface. You can run, jump, turn, shoot, and strafe. Beyond that, a half-dozen keystrokes are all you need to play (and some, like Kabuto&apos;s howls, are for fun and show). Trying to break away from the dark and moody nature of many recent games, Planet Moon made this alien world bright and full of vibrant colors. A great number of graphic options are available, most of them only will work on high-end video cards. In addition, the game tries to maintain a humorous streak. The single player game has goofy dialogue and a few jokes spread along its story line and even the multiplayer is lighthearted, with Smarties cheering you on as you carry them on your back, among other little sounds and nuances.</story>

Basically in 3D arcade fashion, you control Gift who must navigate 10 levels and special rooms, picking up numerous items along the way and meeting characters from other games and films. You’ll recognize the dwarves from Snow White, a Darth Vader’s light sabre, Indiana Jones’ whip, and a machine gun from Quake, among others, as you travel through the levels.

The game is a bullet hell style shooter and there are a significant number of bullets to dodge, sometimes hundreds at a time covering the entire screen. Each of the available ships has three types of attacks. The first is the basic attack. Next is the reflect force; this acts as a temporary shield and any bullets that are encountered are gathered and then fired back at the enemy. The final attack is a bomb and is the most powerful attack affecting everything on the screen. The four ships each have different attack abilities and flight characteristics. As is typical in arcade style shooters, weapon upgrades can be acquired to increase your firepower.</story>

    <story>Go Go Golf is a player golfing game for one to four, where there&apos;s only one human player the game provides the opposition. The player(s) play as one of eight predefined golfing characters, each with their own strengths, on three golf courses which can be played in three ways- Stroke Play- here the match is played over eighteen holes and the player who completes the round in the fewest strokes wins Match Play- where it is the player who wins the most holes who takes the match, here if a player is, say, five holes ahead with just four remaining they are declared the winner Tour- Here the objective is to win more than $1.5m in one season. In order to achieve this the player must win a qualifying match in May so that they can compete in a major tournament. There are four major golfing tournaments in Japan in June and July, two nationals the All Japan Masters and the Asian Open, and two internationals the International World Classic and the World Classic. By winning the nationals the player can progress to the internationals and the big prize money. Games can only be saved during a tour The game has an unusual, one button, style of gameplay. Cross is used to initiate a stroke. As the player shapes up to take their swing a shadowy outline appears behind them and the player must press Cross again at, or near to the top of the swing, the game does not allow Cross to be used beyond the top of the swing. On the downswing the player must press Cross again at the point of impact. With each press during the back and down strokes the player sees a message ranging from Too Fast; A Bit Too Fast, Correct, Perfect; Amazing Skill, through to Too Slow and others. Club selection is automatic and the player cannot make their own shots, with most approach strokes the player has a choice of three shots to play and on the green there is only one shot option. There is no course or hole flyby in this game, no gimme&apos;s, no mulligan&apos;s, and no character creation. Neither the eight players nor the three courses are based on anyone or anywhere in real life. In-game the player can view the ground ahead before they play their shot but all camera viewpoints are automatic. All matches are played over eighteen holes, none of that &apos;front nine&apos;, &apos;back nine&apos; rubbish here. </story>

    <story>When assaulted by a gang of vicious thugs, a shady drifter named Gene gets his right arm cut off. When he comes to, he finds himself with a young girl at his side, and his right arm reattached. But this is no longer an ordinary arm- it&apos;s been replaced with the legendary &apos;God Hand&apos;, and now that he&apos;s got it, Gene&apos;s on the hunt by every demon in the county, as they all want their hands on his. And with four powerful figures planning the demise of the world, things are probably gonna get ugly. God Hand is a Western action-based game where you, well, punch enemies in the face repeatedly with an incredibly powerful fist. Trying to explain the button configuration in God Hand is tough - the player can completely customize their attacks to their liking, as well as earning new ones. You can choose to set up a combo for four presses of the square button (choosing each attack for each press), or select your more powerful special attacks and juggles. By moving the right Analog Stick, you&apos;ll also perform a dodge in that direction. Sometimes, stunning an enemy will cause a press this button icon to appear on-screen (somewhat like God of War, if you perform well at this bonus prompt, you&apos;ll deal some extra damage to the enemy. Once you&apos;ve wailed on enemies enough with your regular fists, your &apos;Tension Gauge&apos; will become full and you can press R2 to use the God Hand itself. This will make you completely invincible, more powerful and speed you up for a brief time. You also have the option to use &apos;Roulette Moves&apos;, which use a special attack depending on the one you have selected. Like all good Westerns, God Hand also features a Casino. In here, you can gamble your life away, by your choice of the slots, video poker, or blackjack. Cash earned at the Casino can be used to purchase all sorts of moves for Gene as well as other power ups.</story>

    <story>God of War is set in the age of ancient Greek myths. The hero of the game is a mortal warrior Kratos. Long time ago, Kratos was the leader of Spartans, a fearless and brutal general who waged wars for the glory of his city. Today, he is known as the Ghost of Sparta. For the past ten years, he is tormented with terrible nightmares, unable to forget the tragedy that happened in his past. He has to serve the gods of Olympus, who promised to forgive his sins if he becomes their champion. Finally, the goddess Athene tells Kratos that redemption will be granted to him if he defeats her brother, the god of war Ares, who was the very reason for the tragic event of his past... Kratos has two default swords that he will always carry with him called the Blades of Chaos. They allow you to perform combos, which will constantly climb until you can no longer fight (you&apos;ve killed everyone in the area), or you take too long to register another hit. The higher your combo total, the more red orbs you get from defeated enemies. Similar to Devil May Cry, the red orbs you collect from fallen enemies can be used to purchase upgrades. You can upgrade your default weapons, so that you can learn new moves and strike faster, or you can put the orbs into different weapons acquired throughout the game, such as Blade of Artemis. Kratos will, over time, also have access to a selection of magic spells. At specific points in the game, you will be able to generate an arc of electricity, courtesy of Zeus, or you will be able to use the decapitated head of a Gorgon to turn enemies into stone, using Meduza&apos;s Gaze. God of War features several unlockable extras, which are only acquired when you beat the game on the different difficulty modes. Most of the features are a behind-the-scenes look at various aspects of the game, such as creating the world, modeling Kratos, and a look at deleted levels that didn&apos;t make the final cut of the game.</story>

    <story>The Golden Compass is an adaptation of the 2007 movie of the same, which in turn is based on the novel Northern Lights, the first in the His Dark Materials trilogy by British novelist Philip Pullman. The game is set in a fantastical parallel universe where the soul of person resides out of the body and lives in the form of animals known as dæmons. The main character is Lyra Belacqua. Her best friend Roger is kidnapped by evil Gobblers and her uncle Lord Asriel is imprisoned when he discovers evidence that proves the existence of Dust particles, much to the dismay of the Magisterial representatives who rule the world as a dogmatic theocracy and do not allow people to contradict their doctrine. Lyra has to leave the safe haven that is Jordan College in Oxford to right the situation. In typical 3rd-person action gameplay, Lyra needs to navigate the different environments. She excels at moving around with acrobatic actions and when enemies appear she relies on her wit, hiding behind objects or searching an escape route. When she is spotted, she can use one of the four collectibles to escape from a tricky situation. Health is represented as courage and a large extent of courage helps solving the puzzles. She can also play a Deception mini-game to outwit characters and gain additional courage. Two other characters provide assistance her during her quest. The first is Pan, Lyra&apos;s dæmon and the manifestation of her spirit. Pan can transform into up to four different forms, gradually discovered during the quest. The basic Ermine form allows Pan to chew through ropes and reveals the areas where Lyra needs to solve puzzles or move around. The Sloth form introduces swinging to grab hold of branches or reach areas hard to access. The third form, Hawk, lets Lyra glide from great heights. She can also send out Pan in this form to retrieve objects at difficult locations. The final Wildcat form has Lyra slide down from special surfaces, climb nets and it provides a dash move to evade enemies. Brute strength is represented by the second support character Iorek Byrnison, an armoured bear known as panserbjørne. He has most of the physical attacks. Next to health (replenished by bloodmoss) he has an armour gauge, filled up by gathering sky armour. Collected rage orbs fill up a rage meter, which introduces a special attack when maxed out. Pan is always by Lyra&apos;s side, while Iorek joins the party later in the game and he is not always present. Lyra&apos;s journal stores her tasks, information about key locations and a section for the Alethiometer, the golden compass. It is a device that reveals the answer to any question when operated by a trained user. It contains four needles - three to construct a question and fourth for the answer. To ask questions and solve puzzles, Lyra needs to play the Divining game. It consists of three sessions where Lyra needs to match symbols to keep the focus (a circle of light) centred on the device, by pressing a key or button to spin a hand in a timely fashion. The meaning of the different symbols is revealed during the course of the game, by interacting with objects and characters. Conversations often introduce mini-games to keep the talking going. Each of the characters can pick up objects that grant new abilities such as new forms, a slow spell, double damage or more insight into the workings of the Alethiometer.</story>

    <story>Long ago, the Gradius army destroyed an evil life form that was threatening the galaxy. But somehow some of the Bacterian cells survived, and a new army has appeared ready to take over the galaxy! The Gradius forces have developed a super spatial-temporal fighter (called the Vic Viper) which you must pilot in order to destroy all of the enemies. The gameplay in Gradius V is an arcade style shooter and is very similar to the other games in the series. You need to guide the Vic Viper through a series of side scrolling screens and destroy the many enemies that appear (including several very large bosses). Although you begin the game with very limited firepower, additional weapons can be acquired. After destroying certain enemies, a power up capsule is left behind; collecting these will advance the weapon selector. When the weapon you want is selected after collecting enough capsules, you can activate it to equip the Vic Viper with that weapon. Your choices are speed up, missiles, double fire, lasers, multiples (these circle the Vic Viper providing additional firepower), and force fields. As you progress through the game, short animated cut scenes will reveal the story, and the enemies become tougher and more numerous. The game is somewhat customizable, allowing you to set the controls, difficulty level, and number of lives you begin with.</story>

    <story>Prince Pixel is in a pickle. His parents have been kidnapped by an evil demon, called...Demon! Pixel has to rely on the power of Graffiti and his pet dog Pastel to release his parents from peril. The story follows Pixel around 22 levels in which he does various tasks with the help of creatures made with his magic wand which has magical powers. The gameplay is your basic action RPG with battling the monsters, jumping some platforms and gaining stuff which helps you advance through the game. The power of Graffiti enables the Prince to animate anything. Anything at all. With Graffiti, the player can make their own monsters which are theirs to control. For example, player can make a monster with huge feet, and that monster can jump high, or if one makes a monster with huge arms (with spikes in them), that monster will probably pack quite a punch. Monster construction is very free, and that means the player can draw anything, and make them alive. Players can draw different parts of the monster, attach them to each other as they please, add a few accessories, paint the parts and define, which part is a hand, leg or an attacking device. Only the player&apos;s imagination is the limit.</story>

In reality, this game, although a full game in its own right, is really nothing more than a extended demo of what to expect in the final release of Gran Turismo 4. The game features two modes- 1. Arcade- there are five brand new tracks to sample, four tarmac, and one rally course. The player may either choose to race against opponents or the clock in this mode; School Mode- is where the game is at. This is where players can accumulate new cars by completing the task. School Mode is simply the License Mode from the previous games. This mode involves the user having to complete either a number of laps, or a segment or track within a certain time limit. The player is then graded as Gold, Silver, and Bronze of Fail.</story>

The game is part of the Grand Theft Auto universe, so there you&apos;ll occasionally encounter characters you met in previous games of the series, although the storyline is pretty independent and makes few references to previous incidents and events. All the other well-known elements of earlier games are in- You can have little side-missions as a pizza delivery boy, vigilante, cab driver, and more. The PSP version supports multiplayer gameplay. Up to six gangsters can compete in deathmatches, capture the flag, and king of the hill.</story>

    <story>Grand Theft Auto- Vice City offers the same go-anywhere style of play as its violent, M-rated predecessor but in a new setting based on Miami. The player takes the role of Tommy Vercetti (voiced by Ray Liotta), a gangster who just got off a fifteen year prison sentence for not squealing on his friends. Because he didn&apos;t rat out his family, Tommy&apos;s sent to work with Sonny Forelli, his old boss. Sonny gives him an easy drug job, but everything goes wrong, and Tommy loses everything. Upon returning to Sonny, he gets mad and wants his money back. Unfortunately, everybody in Vice City, from gangsters and Cubans to bikers and politicians are in his way, and it&apos;s up to Tommy to clear a path. Grand Theft Auto- Vice City takes everything from Grand Theft Auto III and builds upon it. There are new cars in the game, reminiscent of cars from the 80s. Some cars are earlier models of the vehicles from GTA III. New to this game is the ability to drive motorcycles. Tommy can drive a variety of two-wheeled vehicles, from huge Harley-esque bikes to dirt bikes to your standard motorcycle. Flying is also a bigger part of the game, as the player can fly small planes and helicopters, traveling from area to area, landing on helipads on top of towering skyscrapers. Weapons are, more or less, the same as in GTA III, but the addition of melee weapons spices combat up a little. Tommy can use riot batons, crowbars, and a few others. Grand Theft Auto- Vice City uses celebrity voice talent. The main character is voiced by Ray Liotta of Goodfellas, and the supporting cast is voiced by Dennis Hopper (Speed), Gary Busey (Slapshot 2), William Fitcher, Danny Trejo, Luis Guzman (Traffic), and Jenna Jameson (ex porn star). To effectively capture the mood of the 1980s, the soundtrack has been altered to fit the time period. Players will listen to an estimated nine hours of music (nearly three times the amount featured Grand Theft Auto III) across 10 radio stations. The eclectic mix features such noteworthy titles as I Ran by Flock of Seagulls, The Message by Grandmaster Flash, You&apos;ve Got Another Thing Coming by Judas Priest, and Out of Touch by Hall &amp; Oates.</story>

    <story>Vice City Stories is a prequel to Grand Theft Auto- Vice City (2 years earlier) and it is the sequel to Grand Theft Auto- Liberty City Stories. Set in 1984, players take on the role of Vic Vance, an army soldier who loves his country, family, and himself. One bad decision turns everything around and he is kicked onto the streets of a tough city. He has to build an empire to survive, or be left to die. Together with his brother Lance, a drug addict, the siblings try to take over Vice City. Just like other GTA titles, gameplay consists of third-person shooting and driving sequences in an open environment. You will meet new enemies and gangs, and old foes. The missions require you to kill with a selection of weapons, steal vehicles such as a car, a boat, or a plane, rob to make it big, or just to have fun. New features for the portable version include swimming, and side missions such as Air Rescue, Vigilante, Firefighter, and Paramedic. Similar to San Andreas&apos; gang wars, this title has an Empire mode. To make money, you have to take over businesses from other gangs. By attacking and damaging rival businesses, it will be put up for sale, for you to take over. With a new building constructed, you can then choose an activity such as prostitution, drugs, protection racket, smuggling, robbery, or work as a loan shark. These activities earn money and the location in the city influences the revenue. Multiplayer is available over Wi-Fi with ten different game modes, either focusing on fighting (Vice City Survivor), businesses (Empire Takedown), racing (Street Rage), stealing/selling (Grand Theft Auto), capture the flag game types, or games centered around a single vehicle such as a tank.</story>

During a bank heist, Claude is betrayed by Catalina and her Colombian friend Miguel, and he is shot by her just as they are leaving the scene of the crime. Claude fully recovers....in a prison cell. However, while being transported to a prison, Colombians ambush the prison van for an inmate riding with Claude. Claude and his friend, 8-Ball, escape in the process. Now it is time for revenge. Claude slowly rises through the ranks of the local gangs, gaining trust from local mob bosses and turning on others. Claude gains influence, trust, and most importantly, money along the way. It is time for Claude to rise from the dead and get revenge for what Catalina has done. The concept that makes GTA what it is, is now in 3D in this release. The game puts you in the shoes of a vicious, albeit novice, criminal. Traditionally, your missions center on the gangs inhabiting the city - each one always has jobs for you to perform, and your prosperity as a criminal depends on your ability to manipulate each gang. Ice a few members of one gang, and you&apos;ll gain its rival&apos;s favor. Jobs range anywhere from running dope and taking out rivals to sabotage and kidnapping. Strictly for the matured.</story>

Controlling Ryudo, the player will explore various locations, locating townspeople and objects within an area to interact with. Towns and dungeons are displayed in the same manner, though dungeons tend to be mazes filled with monsters and towns tend to be friendly areas filled instead with conversation and shops. Any monsters present in these areas will be shown walking around. Walking over to and touching the monster in any way will activate a battle. If the monster notices the player approaching it is considered a normal battle, if Ryudo is able to approach undetected the player&apos;s party will gain the initiative in battle, if any party member besides Ryudo is approached by the enemy then the party loses initiative. In battle, each character is able to choose from a list of actions that include attack combos (standard attack command), Special Abilities/Magic, Critical Strike, Guard, Evade and Escape. Critical Strikes are weaker versions of attack combos with the advantage that they can block an enemy&apos;s action. This partly depends on the positions of the character on the action bar, displayed at the bottom of the screen, which shows each character (and enemy&apos;s) time to act within the battle. Some magic spells and special abilities are also able to block enemy actions, though they take longer to perform than normal attacks. Both combo attacks and critical attacks require the attacker to run up to the enemy in order to perform the action. This depends heavily on the character&apos;s individual movement as well as other characters acting as obstacles on the screen. Successfully defeating enemies in battle awards experience points, power points, magic points, gold and items.</story>

Running around wildly, they created monsters who disturbed the peace in the world and provoked two mighty nations to start an all-destroying war. After years of battles and pain, the two nations finally decided to sign a peace agreement. Now they wish concentrate together on hunting down and eliminating the insane Spirits. You control a young boy named Evan, who wants to become a Ranger (a fighter who possesses unique abilities), like his father. But before he can be initiated as a Ranger, he has to fulfill an important mission and help to save his world from the Spirits. Grandia Xtreme is the first Grandia game to be originally released for Playstation 2. Its combat system is virtually the same as in the previous two games, a mixture of strategic planning and real-time fighting. Your party members can run around, avoid enemy attacks, and their attack power depends on their distance from the enemies. Grandia Xtreme is heavily based on combat, with more dungeons, more fighting, and less story than the two previous installments of the series.</story>

The people who wished to end the warring revived a powerful weapon called the Admonisher and threatened the participants of the war with it. Thus all of the wars were ended by force. The people behind this called themselves the Peace Maintenance Brigade. 20 years later the old men of the Brigade are no longer able to maintain the peace. Now war has once again broken out among the inhabitants of the continent. A mysterious famine has appeared, leaving the citizens to fight over what little fertile land is left, while the cities are constantly attacked by fierce amphibious monsters known as Screapers Battles take place in real-time, and there is no transition to a separate battle map (which is usually found in traditional Japanese RPGs). As such the game forces players to come up with strategies and tactics immediately as the situation calls for it.</story>

    <story>When the humans created artificial beings named gears in 22th century, they didn&apos;t expect that their creation will eventually turn against them. Because gears had no will of their own and could only obey humans. Only one gear, named Justice, was able to transfer his will onto other gears and to rebel against the humans. In year 2180, Justice was killed as a result of a bloody tournament organized by the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. Yet recently, a new gear was discovered. He showed no signs of hostility, yet he had no master and was roaming about free. It was impossible to capture or to kill him because he was immensely strong. Fearing a new Justice will grow out of this gear, the Order organized yet another tournament, this time with a solid prize- five hundred thousand world dollars for the winner. Guilty Gear X is a follow up to Guilty Gear, and is also a 2D fighting game. There are now 16 characters available for you to choose. The battle system became more complicated, thanks to the variety of moves you can perform. Beside special attacks which you can execute if you build up your Tension Gauge by attacking or advancing towards your opponent, there is also a variety of defensing moves to perform. The instant kill moves are back from the previous game.</story>

The prominent game segment is the career mode where players go through the band&apos;s history, from the earlier seventies to 2001. Times of internal issues are not touched upon. Players initially start as Joe Perry but can later also unlock the other band members Brad Whitford and Tom Hamilton. The career has been divided into six tiers with five tracks, each based on a period in the band&apos;s history. There are also encores when a tier has been completed, and two opening acts playing as another band. After each tier, bonus material is shown such as trivia or video sequences and interviews. Songs are unlocked gradually and become available in the other modes, identical to Guitar Hero III (Quickplay, Cooperative, Competitive + Battle modes). Only the cooperative career mode is absent. The menus have been redesigned and there are new venues, based on historical performances. There are 41 songs in total, of which 31 can be unlocked in the career mode and an additional 10 in the vault. The game is available in a bundle with a custom guitar or as a single game release. For the PS2 version there are two bundles, one with a single, wireless guitar and another with two, wired guitars.</story>

    <story>Guitar Hero- Metallica is the second game in the Guitar Hero series to focus on specific band, following the release of Guitar Hero- Aerosmith. This title largely borrows from the novelties introduced in Guitar Hero- World Tour, with band career modes for single or multiple players with a storyline drawn as a cartoon, competitive modes online, and the possibility to play with different instruments such as a regular guitar, a bass guitar, drums, and doing the vocals. The storyline describes how a band wants to follow in the footsteps of the Metallica and become a leading act on their tour. This edition adds an Expert+ difficulty mode where players need to drum using a second bass pedal to mimic the playing style of Lars Ulrich, the drummer of the band. The members also did motion capture sessions for the avatars in the game. The music selection consists of 28 master recordings and 21 additional songs by others selected by the band. Bonus features include various videos and trivia about the songs. Progress is made by completing sets of songs, rather than a series of gigs as in Guitar Hero- World Tour, set in venues that were in important in the band&apos;s career. Performances are rated with stars and a certain amount is needed to progress and unlock a new set. The game also includes the GHTunes from World Tour where new songs can be created and shared. A new Drum Mode offers the possibility to play the drums without an existing drum track to create new rhythms, and the Battle mode (from Guitar Hero III- Legends of Rock), has been updated with Metallica influences for the power-ups, with names like Fade To Black, Under The Ice and Ride The Lightning. Although released in Europe packaged with a guitar controller and Metallica faceplate, other regions were not so fortunate and only received a solus edition. Custom drumsticks and a second bass pedal were offered as pre-order bonuses in certain stores. The Metallica tracklist includes- 1. All Nightmare Long 2. Battery 3. Broken, Beat &amp; Scarred 4. Creeping Death 5. Cyanide 6. Disposable Heroes 7. Dyers Eve 8. Enter Sandman 9. Fade to Black 10. Fight Fire with Fire 11. For Whom the Bell Tolls 12. Frantic 13. Fuel 14. Hit the Lights 15.

    <story>Guitar Hero 5 is the fifth main game in the musical rhythm series. Similar to the previous title, Guitar Hero- World Tour, the focus is on a band-experience, with a lead and bass guitar, drums and vocals. The title is available standalone or bundled with the instruments. Next to a new soundtrack with 85 songs, many animated lead singers are now modelled after famous musicians such as Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Kurt Cobain, and Matthew Bellamy. Players can still compose their own songs in the included studio and the game relies heavily on downloadable content, through tracks and full albums. A portion of the songs of Guitar Hero- World Tour, Guitar Hero Smash Hits and Band Hero can be imported in exchange for a small fee per song. In the Band Lobby players can assemble a party of local and remore players to form a band, play the Career mode or opt for Quickplay. Most of the competitive multiplayer modes are carried over from former versions, along with two new ones- Party Play (random song selection with the option to join and leave at will using any instrument) and RockFest, a band mode for up to four (local) or up to eight (online) players with a variety of submodes. The songs are divided in smaller portions and for each section the players are rewarded based on a variety of conditions. General new features introduced to the gameplay include drop-in/drop-out play, where it is possible to join in the middle of a song or stop playing without interrupting gameplay. There is also a new Challenges section in the Career mode. The different game versions are identical, except for the PS2 version that lacks online game modes and downloadable content, drop-in/drop-out play and song challenges. It is also limited to two instruments and the multitap is not supported. The Wii version is very similar to the major console versions, including downloadable content on SD cards, multiplayer through the global Wii address book, and the Mii Freestyle mode from the previous game. It also supports interaction with the Nintendo DS to edit videos and provides access to the Roadie Battle mode, similar to the main battle mode of Guitar Hero III, where players complete mini-games on the Nintendo DS to sabotage the players on the console.</story>

    <story>Guitar Hero Encore- Rocks the 80s is an incremental title in the Guitar Hero series, using the features and gameplay from Guitar Hero II but with a completely new batch of songs. The game&apos;s theme is the eighties, reflected by the characters and their clothing, the venues and of course the songs themselves. It is the last title in the series developed by the original creators Harmonix Music Systems, Inc. As in the previous games, in the single-player mode the player works his way through a setlist unlocking increasingly difficult songs, divided over 4 main difficulties. By performing well, new songs and venues become available, but there are less unlockables compared to the previous titles. Notable bands in this edition include A Flock of Seagulls, The Police, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Asia, Dio and Anthrax. Unlike the previous games, there are no bonus tracks. The game is played through the guitar controller introduced for this series. The multi-player modes include Co-op, Face-off and Pro Face-off, identical to the previous game.</story>

    <story>Guitar Hero II, the follow-up to the PS2-only game Guitar Hero, expands upon the gameplay and features of the original game. As a wannabe rockstar, you need to play songs by pressing combinations of five fret buttons on a guitar-shaped controller, while working the strum bar, along with an optional whammy bar for distortion. The sequel contains 64 songs, of which 40 have been licensed. One of the tracks was discovered through a contest at beaguitarhero.com, where unlicensed bands could send in a demo to be included in the game. Most of the tracks have been covered in-studio, but a few use original recordings. The career mode has been revamped as a high school battle where you need to make your way to the top. Every venue is now represented by a different city. There are also encore performances, and unlockables can still be bought in the shop. A completely new addition is the practice mode (Shred School). When you keep getting stumped by a single track, you can train in this mode. The background music is dropped, you can choose a certain section to practice, and there four types of speeds available, to slowly get the hang of difficult passages. In the multiplayer mode, you can still play the traditional mode from the first game, where sections are traded off between players. The co-op mode is new- both players play the same song at the same time, but one is given the lead guitar, while the other handles the bass or rhythm guitar. Unlike the traditional mode, you can fail and both player share the score, rock meter and multiplier. To activate star power (a short power-up mode where the score multiplier is doubled, built up in a meter by playing a number of star-shaped notes without flaws and best saved for difficult sections) both players need to raise the guitar at the same time. You cannot practice together in this mode, but the different sections are available in the singleplayer practice mode. The final mode is called Face-Off. Here, both players play every single note at the same time. In the multiplayer mode, each player can now choose an individual difficulty level. Upon completing Face-Off, Pro Face-Off becomes available, where both players need to use the same difficulty level. Other additions are the introduction of three-button chords, the use of hammer-ons and pull-offs (holding one note while playing another and vice versa) is smoother, and the screen now shakes if you break a note streak (only of the side of the player who makes the mistake in the multiplayer mode).</story>

    <story>Guitar Hero III- Legends of Rock is the third full game in the Guitar Hero series and fourth game overall. The gameplay remains similar to the previous games- using a guitar-shaped controller, you need to coordinate pressing the five fret buttons and strumming to the scrolling notes on screen. Missing notes will cause your performance meter to drop; if the meter drops too low then the performance is a failure and you will need to try again. This edition of the game features 71 new songs to play from various artists including Cream, The Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath, Aerosmith, Guns N&apos; Roses, Santana, Sonic Youth, Weezer, and many more. In addition to the available songs the game also features &amp;quot;boss battles&amp;quot; against famous guitarists such as Slash, Tom Morello and Lou the Devil. Several game modes are available including career mode, co-op mode, and multiplayer mode. In addition to the main game modes, training and practice modes are available to aid in learning the game or figuring out a tricky passage in a song. In career mode you play the part of a wanna-be rock star. Beginning with easier songs in small venues, you need to successfully complete tracks to make your way up to a superstar. Each venue you play requires a certain number of songs to be performed before you can move on to the next larger venue. Successful completion of songs also earns money which can be used to unlock characters, outfits, new guitars, and other bonuses. The co-op career mode is similar to the single player variation, except two players work together (one on lead guitar, the other on bass or rhythm guitar) to complete songs. The multiplayer game modes allow two players to compete against each other. In the Face-Off variation, two players take turns performing a song. The Pro Face-Off variation allows two players to compete at the same time playing the exact same note chart. Finally, in the battle mode each player can earn power ups by performing well which can be used to disrupt the other player.</story>

    <story>Guitar Hero- World Tour is the fourth main game in the series and brings a major change to the concept. Following the release of Rock Band that built on the Guitar Hero concept but added additional instruments, World Tour introduces these as well to allow players to play together simultaneously as a real band. Next to the guitar that was the main peripheral for the previous titles, the bundled edition of the game adds a microphone for the vocal parts and drums for percussion. Just like the previous game, the guitar tracks are split up for the lead and bass. The lyrics and the vocal pitch is shown near the top of the screen, while the bottom part is split up for bass guitar, lead guitar and drums, each with a separate set of notes that need to be hit to correctly play the part. While playing, a rock meter keeps track of successive notes hit (one for each player), which leads to score multipliers. When the meter becomes too low, other players can make up for this on a shared, general performance meter. In the same vein players share a star power meter, built up by playing through certain sections successfully, that any player can access. There are four difficulty levels and a new beginner mode where notes are made as easy as possible to introduce the concept to new players. Most of the game content is centered around a Career mode (both Solo and Band) where players start a new band, choose an avatar an instrument, and then play different gigs unlocking new songs along the way. Completing tracks earns money that can be spent on outfits or instruments. There are once again encore songs and boss challenges where the lead guitar enters a duel. This is similar to the battles in Guitar Hero III, but without the power-ups. Instead it returns to a call-and-response mechanic similar to the Face-Off mode. Bands consists of offline players but online members can join as well. Complete bands can take on others online through the Battle of the Bands mode. Through the Music Studio editor new songs can be composed and shared using the GHTunes service (not for the PS2). In this edition avatars can be customized with more detail using the Create-a-Rocker mode. Major artists have licensed their appearance in the game. The Wii version contains a Mii Freestyle mode where players can use their Mii characters in-game and compose songs through motions of the Wii remote and the Nunchuk controller. There are several bundles for the game, based on the amount of instruments included, but also a stand-alone version as most of the versions are compatible with the controllers of previous games and even some of Rock Band.</story>

    <story>The Wild Wild West meets Grand Theft Auto in this free-roaming action game. Set in 1870, you are Colton White, a young gunslinger whose father is killed by an Indian tribe led by Reverend Reed. Just before passing away, your father hands you a token and reveals you are not his son. Sworn to avenge his death, you pursue the killers and unravel the secrets surrounding the item. Although you are on your own, temporary alliances can be formed with townspeople, Apaches and posse members, but watch your back as they can turn against you. The main storyline, written by Hollywood screenwriter Randall Jahnson (The Mask of Zorro, 1998,) is linear. You will have to fight duels, defend towns against bandits, help build railway tracks, intervene in various conflicts and kill heavily-armed bossed. There are also many side missions or alternative ways to earn money. You can play poker in the casino, help out farmers with their livestock, assist the local sheriff or deliver items with the pony express. Other possibilities include bounty hunting, regular hunting for rare animals, mining for gold and various rescue missions. The RPG elements involve acquiring and improving skills, such as QuickDraw (shown in Bullet Time,) Zoom Firing, Melee Combat, improved accuracy, the ability to throw axes and strategically equipping and upgrading different weapons. There are hand weapons (knives, tomahawks, bayonets), archery arms, explosive throwable items and regular guns, such as sharpshooter rifles, colts and winchesters. Some are earned during the missions, others can be bought and sold for cash in the towns. The GTA reference is reflected in the main means of transportation- horses. There are different animals to find with extensive movement options. Go on wild chases, spurt, gallop, do skid attacks, or trample your enemies. Give them some rest from time to time, or you will wear them down to death. In the melee combat, you can do roll maneuvers, use objects to provide cover, grab your opponents and even scalp them. You are free to steer away from the main storyline and explore the giant landscape, with towns, deserts, mountains, wilderness and caves.</story>

    <story>On July 29, 2010, the city of Saronica comes under attack by an army of monsters called the SMO as they lay siege to the city, capturing it and ruling the populace under an iron fist. During this, The Resistance is formed in an attempt to stop the SMO, lead by a woman by the name of Lily who is kidnapped when she attempts to help a man by the name of Kou. After she is captured, it is learned the man has come into possession of two ancient pistols by the name of Crimson that can destroy the monsters and their vicious leader. Kou sets out with Lily&apos;s daughter, Yuri, to bring her back and stop the evil forces within the city. Death Crimson is a light-gun game similar in style to House of the Dead where the player shoots at enemies that pop up on screen and save innocents from the monsters. The player can also power-up the Crimson pistols by shooting death flowers that will turn their firepower into machine guns to decimate hordes of enemies. There is also a health meter that will increase in size by successfully shooting enemies, gaining experience points. Once enough points are obtained, the health bar will increase, however missing enemies or shooting civilians will take away points.</story>

    <story>Three years after the events that took place in the original Gungrave, the Corsione family has unleashed the deadly drug SEED upon the populace. Now it&apos;s up to Grave, Spike and Mika to follow the trail of SEED back to its source and eradicate it once and for all. Much like its predecessor, Gungrave- Overdose offers up several action-packed levels that simply don&apos;t allow the player to let up on the fire button. This sequel ups the ante with even larger hordes of enemies to blast through along with a slew of destructible environments to wreak havoc in. Along the way, Grave will team up with newcomers Juji and Billy. Juji fights using a unique combination of close-range guns and swordplay, while Billy defeats his enemies with the sheer power of his electric guitar. Gungrave- Overdose features character designs by Yasuhiro Nightow (creator of the anime/manga Trigun) and Kosuke Fujishima (known for his work on Sakura Wars, Ah My Goddess, and the Tales series), and soundtrack composition by Tsuneo Imahori (composer for Trigun, Hajime no Ippo and the Gungrave anime series). This game was released by Mastiff as a budget-priced title.</story>

Their naughty bits are obscured by Guy Game logos, but depending on how much bonus score you get, you can remove the censoring from the clips and unlock them for uhm... further analysis.

    <story>The PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life is a port of the Windows game, but with a significant overhaul for the weapons and character models, as well as the overall map geometry and some extended levels. It also includes an expansion pack that is referred to as Half-Life- Decay, which was never officially available as an expansion for the Windows game until it was eventually recreated as a modification. The third expansion for the original game, it features two-player cooperative gameplay (in split-screen) with the two female scientists Gina Cross and Colette Green as the protagonists. It is meant to be played with two players at the same time as it is more puzzle-oriented than the original game and the first two expansions. Singleplayer is also possible, but then switching between the two characters is necessary to advance. When not active, the other character is AI controlled for basic actions. It is set at the same time of the events in the original Half-Life, but from the perspective of other characters. All enemies and weapons are based on the original game and many of the missions have a more friendly approach about working together or rescuing NPCs. Unique to the series as a whole is the lack of a single narrative; instead the add-on consists of fixed, separate missions. At the end of each mission, statistics are shown and the player is graded. When the nine levels are completed with an A grade, a bonus mission is unlocked where players control and work together as two Vortigaunts. As an additional bonus, the entire singleplayer can then also be completed as a Vortigaunt. The game supports an USB mouse and keyboard for more precise control.</story>

He learns about the exploits of Hanuman &amp; never realizes that everyone is talking about his exploits till the moment of truth when that realization dawns on him. So the key theme here is the emergence of a hero &amp; the message that one can become a hero through bravery &amp; justness of their actions. There are a number of defining moments in the story. Bal Hanuman&apos;s discovery that he is actually Hanuman, the regaining of his powers one by one; and the final Wow moment where Hanuman is standing on a hilltop with a bright sun in the sky. Lastly the fact that Hanuman never kills his adversaries only frees them (Soul) of their bad Karma is a defining moment in the story. </story>

    <story>Quidditch, the broomstick and ball “sport” of the Harry Potter world comes to life in this simulation. For those unfamiliar with the game, two seven player teams of flying wizards attempt to score goals with one ball while dodging more flying balls and each other. For those who are familiar with the game, you will be happy to know that the players, positions, and “strategies” of Quidditch are faithfully recreated. The game starts with a player selecting which of the four Hogwarts school teams he or she wishes to play for. Following some tutorial events, they are launched into the competition for the Hogwarts Cup against the other three teams. As the player wins games and completes specific challenges (such as “score 120 points in one game”) they collect Quidditch cards which unlock special combo moves. Once a player has won the school championship, they can go on to play as one of nine international teams competing for the Quidditch World Cup each with it’s own style and special combo moves. After winning the cup once, there are still more cards to be collected by playing and winning as different teams. People familiar with actual sports know that the rules of Quidditch (as described in Rowlings&apos; books) are fundamentally flawed and that the only meaningful part of the game is the 1 on 1 competition between the two seekers trying to catch the golden snitch. Quidditch World Cup alleviates this problem with the “golden snitch bar”. As the game progresses, completing action combos and performing special moves adds to a team progress bar. Eventually, when the snitch appears, the team with better positioning on the bar will start with an advantage in the chase. Ironically, this system rewards things other than actual scoring so in-game goals still remain mostly meaningless (except on lower difficulty levels where it is very easy to build a 160+ point lead and make the snitch inconsequential). Because it is designed for younger audiences, Quidditch World Cup lacks most of the advanced features you would expect in an EA sports game (league play, team management, etc…). It also lacks any multiplayer options other than two player (same machine) exhibition matches</story>

    <story>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is based on the movie of the same name. The player takes the role of Harry Potter who has to fight against Lord Voldemort and his minions. The game is not completely linear - between the chapters Harry can explore the school at his own leisure. If the player does not want to walk and search around, they have two ways to cut a corner- portraits, which are unlocked during the course of the game, can be used to teleport instantly to another place. Harry can also call a ghost which shows him the fastest way to the next mission. Exploration has mostly one goal- finding the 150 (more or less) hidden crests which unlock achievements and trophies. Because Harry lost his ability to jump and climb, he has to use spells to reach them. Mini Games The player will spend most of his time in three mini games- magic duels, brewing potions, and quidditch. The duels are used to learn new spells respectively improve the already known. Harry basically faces other magicians and uses his spells to defeat them, e.g. by paralyzing them or by parrying their spells. To perform a spell the player has to use his input device to recreate a certain movement. Quidditch is a reaction test. Harry&apos;s broom flies automatically and the player can only slightly move it to fly through rings or avoid obstacles. While brewing potions Harry faces a bowl, ingredients and a time limit. Now he simply needs to recreate the receipt by using the ingredients in the correct on the bowl. Sometimes he needs to heat up the bowl or stir the brew up with his input device. If he makes a mistake there is smoke which costs time.</story>

    <story>Two years after versions on other platforms, the then-current consoles got their own adaptation of the first Harry Potter book and film. Like in the computer and PlayStation versions, Harry Potter&apos;s first year at school of magic Hogwarts is presented as a 3D action adventure title. After a tutorial at Ollivander&apos;s Wand Shop and an introductory first night at Hogwarts, the game is organized into distinct days and nights. Days mostly consist of lessons, where usually Harry will learn new spells. The more interesting stuff happens at night, of course, when Harry sneaks around the castle to do things like meeting Draco Malfoy for a duel, fighting a troll in the dungeons, and other important scenes from the film and book. Most tasks involve platform sections, where Harry has to jump over chasms and balance along edges. Often, creatures will be in the way that have to be fought using the correct spells, and magic must also be used to solve the occasional puzzle. At night, Harry must watch out for prefects patrolling the floors of the castle to avoid getting sent back to the common room. There&apos;s also broomstick flying in the game, including a Quidditch match against Slytherin. After classes, Hogwarts can be freely explored. At any time, it is possible to revisit school lessons to get better grades, often only possible after some more advanced spells have been learned. Also, lots of collectibles can be found both in the open and hidden areas- collecting 20 wizard cards increases Harry&apos;s health and Every Flavour Beans can be traded in Fred and George&apos;s shop for more cards and some other useful items.</story>

    <story>Harvest Moon- A Wonderful Life is the second game in the Harvest Moon series to appear on the PS2. It is almost identical to the original GameCube version, but carries some new features, granting it the Special Edition title, as there is no regular release for this platform. The game simulates the everyday chores of farm life. When the player&apos;s character arrives in the Forget-Me-Not-Valley, he is given a tour on his new farm and starts with some seeds and a single cow. The game is divided in different chapters that end when certain requirements are met. Tasks include raising cattle and taking care of them, fishing, cooking, sowing seeds, and trading your goods with the local merchants. The player can also explore the valley and meet its inhabitants. New features for the PS2 version include up to four wives to marry, to have a son or a daughter with a mini career path, new farming equipment such as the fertilizer machine, and a free play mode to continue playing when all the chapters have been completed.</story>

    <story>The first Harvest Moon game for the PS2 takes a little deviance from all the other games in the series. The goal this time around is to save your town from being turned into a resort next year. The game focuses more on relationships than making money - which is the goal in all other Harvest Moon games to date. You still are running a farm and must succeed in the life of a farmer, but the actual gameplay rewards those who interact with the townspeople over those who just work the fields.</story>

However, the castle inhabitants are, for various reasons, not very happy to see Fiona as the new owner.

Haunting Ground is a horror game that centers around avoiding combat and escaping from your enemies. Fiona can fight, but usually she is too weak to defeat her foes in combat, so she will have to run away, to hide, and to use items as distraction until the enemy loses sight of her ans she is able to continue exploring. The most important gameplay tool is your dog. You can issue commands to the dog, telling him to scout a room for you, to warn you of upcoming enemies, to defend you in battle, to pick up items, etc. The dog will obey or disobey you depending on how you develop your relationship with him. If you are nice to the dog, pet him and give him food, he will follow your commands more efficiently.</story>

    <story>The King Athellion has left his homeworld to fight in an intergalactic crusade. He left behind a huge bell - The Golden Voice - for his people to call him should they ever be in danger. During his absence however, the evil Lord Vetch invades the planet and enslaves Athellion&apos;s people by infecting them with a deadly virus. A virus, that requires a constant treatment with an antidote called catana. As the only one controlling the catana-support, Lord Vetch was easily able to force everyone to work for him. In order to prevent Athelion&apos;s return he has hidden The Golden Voice and soon it was forgotten along with the king&apos;s promise. Forgotten until Haven, one of the slaves, starts having dreams about a hill and a bell; dreams whose meaning he does not understand. When the news of the Haven&apos;s dreams reach Lord Vetch, he orders to murder him. Haven manages to escape and eventually learns about the real meaning of his dreams and is determined to find The Golden Voice and put an end to Lord Vetch&apos; reign. Haven is a fast-paced, action-packed platformer but it also incorporates elements of several other genres. Haven can pick up many different weapons and parts of the game play more like a Shoot&apos;Em Up than a platformer. There are also several vehicles to control, ranging from speedboats and jetcars to gliders ,spaceships and jetpacks. Despite all these action elements, there are also some slower paced levels, which put more emphasize on puzzle-solving and exploration. Haven&apos;s conceptual artwork was done by Rodney Matthews, a fairly well-known English sci-fi/fantasy artist, which is evident in Haven&apos;s surrealistic, bizarre design.</story>

    <story>In the 21st century, a dreadful virus wiped out millions. The vaccine was found, but at the time the world was engulfed into chaos. A new world order emerged, splitting the world into two distinct yet dependent worlds- Above and Below. The world Above reflects a chrome city, a high-rise, high-tech metropolis served by elevators and elevated freeways. A place for hardworkers and law-abiding people. On the contrary to Above, the world Below, which is the product of earthquake damages, is a subterranean network of labour colonies. Those who are not wanted Above for one reason or another are sent Below. One day, now veteran Headhunter, Jack Wade, took a call to investigate an intrusion to the upper levels. Facing the trespasser, Jack saw a potential in the girl and instead of turning her in, he gave her a second chance... to become his apprentice. Jack is back, but this time, he&apos;s not alone but accompanied by his sidekick Leeza X. Together, they will face whatever threat lurks from the world Below. The gameplay is set in 3rd-person view with ability to rotate camera or set it behind your back at the single click. Headhunter&apos;s main accessory is IRIS (Intelligent Realtime Information Scanner). Once you get the IRIS, you&apos;ll be able to scan every item just by pointing the gun at it, or use the scanner in 1st-person view which will let you examine the surroundings in more detail. Also, IRIS will provide you with a full 3D map info even displaying the enemies so you can avoid them or use stealth if necessary. Enemies will hear you running and shooting, so if you decide to take an action, be aware that they will surround you and launch a team strike at you from all the sides. You only effective aid against them, beside your weapon, of course, is the ability to perform a roll or lean against the walls and fire from the corners, although aiming itself may not be easy as your hand will not be steady while on the move or panicking.</story>

    <story>Welcome to the future. In the early 21st century, gang warfare and crime have lead to the creation of privatised law enforcement. The Anti-Crime Network (ACN) employs bounty hunters known as ‘Headhunters’ to track down the most wanted criminals, using combat skills and high-tech weaponry. You are Jack Wade, an ex-cop turned Headhunter. At the beginning of the game you find yourself strapped to an operating table and manage to escape. After passing out in an alley, you awake in hospital from a coma. With your license revoked and few memories, you are hired by Angela Stern, to find her fathers murderer. Maybe you’ll even find out what happened to yourself if you can stay alive long enough… Headhunter is an action adventure viewed from over the shoulder. In the top right of the screen you have a radar which will track your movements and those of the enemy. Jack has a few moves at his disposal. He can duck and roll, push, pull and climb objects as well as flatten himself up against a wall. Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection. Between levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination. Certain parts of the city are unavailable until you have gained the appropriate Headhunter license. As you have no recollection of your past, you have to take a series of licenses that will grant you access to greater parts of the city, weaponry and gadgets. These are taken in a VR simulator known as the Law Enforcement Intelligence and Licence Approval (LEILA). At various times in the game you will need to go to the LEILA building and upgrade your licence by practising your combat, stealth and driving skills. Jack will need to pass LEILA tests in order to grant him access to the equipment dispensers. He starts the game with a standard issue Stimulator Automatic, but can acquire grenades, proximity mines, neurostunners, decoy shells, shotguns and automatic weapons as he progresses. The weapons in the game fire Electric Neural Projectiles (ENP’s) instead of bullets. These cause brain death so as to preserve the internal organs of the person being shot. Jack also uses a CASIO Visual Manager to keep in touch with Angela and his former chief at the ACN. This is a wristwatch with video capabilities and a direct link to the LEILA database.</story>

    <story>Heroes of Might and Magic- Quest for the DragonBone Staff is really the old classic King&apos;s Bounty from New World Computing for the PC with revamped graphics. Very little else has changed, in fact even the text was the exact same with the original. For those who are not familiar with the history of the series, King&apos;s Bounty was a spin-off of the Might &amp; Magic RPG series which was then still in its early chapters and was inspired by board games. The gameplay resembles a simplified Heroes of Might &amp; Magic game with only one Hero and no city improvements. Combat is turn-based using a set grid and stacked units. The goal of the game is to discover an ancient artifact by collecting pieces of a map and identifying its location before time runs out. Of course the player must have amassed a strong army by then because he will have to face the evil Dragon overlord before the end.</story>

    <story>Heroes of the Pacific is an arcade flying game set in the Pacific theatre of World War II. Heroes has six game modes including Campaign Mode, Mission Mode, Instant Action, Training, Historical Missions and Multiplayer. In the Campaign mode, the player is William Crowe, a young pilot who survives the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, but loses his brother.

The game features over thirty famous planes including- F6F Hellcat, P-38 Lightning, TBF Avenger, F4U Corsair, B25 Mitchell, P-51 Mustang, Seafire, A6M Zero &amp;quot;Zeke&amp;quot;, J2M Raiden &amp;quot;Jack&amp;quot;, Ki-84 Hayate &amp;quot;Frank&amp;quot;, ME262 and FW190. The war in the Pacific and William Crowe&apos;s personal quest for revenge both come together in the final assault on Iwo Jima, the volcanic fortress-island under Japanese control.</story>

    <story>The perfect hitman, Agent 47, tries to distance himself from his violent past and becomes a humble church gardener. But he is tricked into returning to his trade when his friend, a priest, gets kidnapped by an Italian mafioso. Hitman 2- Silent Assassin is a third-person stealth game. As a titular hitman, you have to complete a number of missions all over the world. Each mission generally involves assassinating someone, and possibly fulfilling a couple of other objectives. Typically, your target will be protected by numerous guards. While there&apos;s a large arsenal of weapons available to you - ranging from stealthy weapons such as a garrote or a silenced pistol, up to machine guns and sniper rifles - your main weapon will be stealth. Agent 47 can sneak around to remain undetected, and he can disguise himself in clothes from killed or stunned guards. The guards aren&apos;t completely stupid, however, as they will investigate suspicious noises, and they&apos;ll react if they see you waving around a gun. They&apos;ll get suspicious if they see you running around, raise alarm upon finding a corpse, and if you hang in a disguise around them too long, they&apos;ll eventually realize you&apos;re not one of their buddies. Hitman 2- Silent Assassin brings something new to the series- depending on your stealthiness, you are given a rating upon completing a mission. Going trigger-happy on everyone will result in being called a Mass Murderer, while only the most patient and skilled players will manage to receive the Silent Assassin rating, which generally involves stealthily eliminating the target without raising any suspicion.</story>

    <story>An evil fallen angel steals the Divine Crystal, one of Heaven&apos;s untouchable treasures. With this crystal he gains the power to control the thoughts of Shogun Ieyasu Tokugawa, and forces him to occupy Osaka castle and put himself in power using his newfound powers. In Heaven, the leaders of the individual heavenly families form a council with one aim... to regain the Divine Crystal. But they can&apos;t do this alone, so they decide to use the prisoner Homura to aid them. While they don&apos;t want to release him, he is the only one who&apos;s blood is half that of an angel and half human making him immune against the Crystal&apos;s powers. Homura refuses at first, but when he finds out that his mother was one of the victims at Osaka he picks up his sword and is ready to fight once again... Homura is a top-down shoot&apos;em up of the bullet-hell persuasion. The player takes on the role of Homura as he fights his way through 4 levels filled with demons. Each stage has a branching path where Homura can pick which route to take. The paths will meet up at the end of the stage however, so the boss fight will always be the same. There are several ways to dispose of the enemies in the game, where the common one is a projectile attack (as it the norm of the genre). What sets this game apart is Homura&apos;s sword slash technique; When used it makes the enemies&apos; bullets bounce back towards them. The more bullets are slashed at once, the higher the score multiplier will be. The sword slash has to be recharged for a few seconds each time after use. There are also powerful special attacks which will clear the screen of all enemies or do massive damage to bosses. Killed enemies drop money, which is used to fill up a meter. When the meter is full, an option helper is added to Homura&apos;s side adding additional fire power. The aspect ratio can be changed in the options menu in a multitude of ways, one of which means placing the screen sideways (for standing the TV on its side) to make it more similar to the original arcade cabinet&apos;s setup. There is also an unlockable art gallery which will have more pictures added to it the further the player makes it through the game.</story>

The overall look and feel of the game is pretty much the same as it&apos;s predecessors, taking the PS2&apos;s extra power into account. The same &apos;tap-tap-tap&apos; system for hitting the ball is back. There are a number of different courses, characters, clubs, and ball types to choose from. New equipment can be purchased with experience points, which your characters earn by winning matches. Better equipment will ease up the games difficulty a bit by providing greater accuracy, distance, and control. As an addition feature, the game has an international ranking system of sorts. With a password from the game you can post your scores on a website, where you can see how you measure up against everyone else out there.</story>

During the course of the game the player takes control over six characters - most of them vary notably regarding gameplay. But of course most of the time is spent in a 3rd person platformer where the player controls his character while jumping over gaps, avoiding enemies and collecting items. Depending on the character the player has different attacks to his disposal. There are also numerous levels with are basically mini games, e.g. a classic 2D platforming section, a side-scrolling shooter, balancing on a snowball or dogfights while riding a pterodactyl.</story>

    <story>Ice Age 2- The Meltdown is loosely based on the movie of the same name. The game takes place in prehistory - you play as Scrat, the hapless (but not totally helpless!) proto-squirrel, helping your friends escape the coming of a huge flood. The WASD keys move you forward and back, left and right, and the mouse controls camera movement and some actions. Scrat has a few special moves as well, such as sniff, his spin attack, a double jump, a ground stomp (useful for breaking ice) and a roll attack. Much of the game consists of hunting down acorns and other special nuts for health renewal or for unlocking bonuses. There are a few mini-games within the game - you can play as Sid, zipping along an ice slide while avoiding obstacles; there&apos;s also penguin-bowling and a mini-game where you &amp;quot;shoot&amp;quot; at monkeys to regain a walnut that was whisked out from under your nose.</story>

Entombed in a crumbling ancient castle Ico only manages to begin his escape when a freak earthquake shakes loose the vessel he has been locked in. Ico shortly meets a Princess named Yorda who has also been imprisoned by the evil Queen. Ico must negotiate the puzzles of the ruined castle and escort the Princess to safety. She, as well as Ico, cannot climb or jump, so Ico has to clear or create a path where there is none. Yorda is the only one capable of opening the many magical doors necessary to escape. Ico needs her as much as she needs him, so he must protect her from the many evil spirits that will try to take her away. Shown through a third-person perspective, mixing action-based exploration gameplay with puzzles, the game has no HUD. Other striking features are the soft lightning visual style, later adapted by many other games, low-key use of in-game music, and conversations through a fictional language, leaving much to the player&apos;s imagination. The game takes place in the same universe as Shadow of the Colossus (2005), to which it is a sequel.</story>

    <story>In six hours the evil Professor Elvin Atombender&apos;s nuclear missiles will launch and destroy strategic locations on the earth. Only one agent can infiltrate his secret base and undertake this Impossible Mission. The goal of Impossible Mission is to acquire nine passwords and bring these to Atombender&apos;s Control Room in time to shut down the rockets. Unfortunately these passcodes (contained on punch cards) have been broken into four pieces each, and each piece hidden in computers, furniture, and waste bins throughout the base. On top of that Atombender has an entire army of robots patrolling the base. If a robot touches or shocks the agent then ten minutes are removed from the clock and the room is reset. The agent can jump over robots, but the only way to stop them is to expend a specific item on a room&apos;s computer terminal, and even that only disables them for a few seconds. The 2007 release of the game has a few improvements over the original version, mostly to improve the graphics and make the game easier. The player can select one of three agents, although all of them possess the same abilities. Robots are now color coded according to what they are capable of doing (yellow only patrol, red patrol and shock, blue can follow and shock), but some aspects of each robot&apos;s personality can still only be figured out by watching or approaching them. Finally an easy mode has been added that adds an extra two hours to the clock and marks rooms which you have cleared out of items. The original mode with the original graphics can also be played, as well as a mixed mode that uses the old avatar graphics, makes all robots the same color, but keeps any other graphical upgrades.</story>

    <story>This is the last installment to the discontinued Konami&apos;s ISS series, the arcade-oriented brother of the PES/WE saga. In ISS 3 you can choose from Friendly mode, International Cup, Custom League, World League or Training mode, where you will take part with the best national teams. You will also count with a points system, where for every match you win you will accumulate points that later can be given away in exchange for extra moves, extra modes or stadiums. There&apos;s also a Mission mode, which is quite similar to the Scenario mode previously seen in the earlier ISS games. The game itself has many arcade components, as the possibility to execute spectacular dribblings adorned with flashes and lights or the fact that you can&apos;t usually make poor directed shots. The players will also look like their counterparts in real life.</story>

    <story>The game is based on an animé series of the same name. You can play either as a teenager boy or a teenager girl, named by the player. The two scenarios are very similar and basically follow the same story- you live in modern-day Tokyo and one day discover a strange symbol in an old storehouse. As a result, you are transported to medieval Japan. You encounter the half-demon Inuyasha, who introduces you to Kagome Higurashi, the heroine of the animé series. Together you embark on a journey to retrieve scattered pieces of the Sacred Jewel and to find a way to get back home. This is a fairly traditional console-style RPG with random encounters and turn-based combat viewed from over-the-shoulder perspective. You can attack physically, use special techniques, and power up to combo attacks with multiple characters.</story>

    <story>Iridium Runners is a futuristic running game that pits competitors against each other on hazard-riddled race tracks in foot races. Players can choose one of 20 characters that have unique running skills and techniques. Some of the characters and tracks can only be unlocked as the game progresses. All of the runners will do just about anything to win, so the action can become down and dirty. Almost anything goes during the races including knocking opponents completely off the track with a well-placed kick, fist or weapon. Power-ups and booster items are scattered around the course for increasing performance, speed or providing a new method of attack. Strategy comes into play by knowing which character and which pod sidekick to choose. There are three modes of play- Single Race, Cup and Championship. Each offers unique environments, different obstacles and challenges. The Single Player game will put the player up against 5 CPU opponents. Multiplayer is offline and includes Deathmatch and Team modes (2 players on 2 teams) and up to 4 players in split screen.</story>

    <story>Mostly based on the 2008 movie Iron Man, this videogame of the one-man-army hero has been released for seven different platforms. The game of Iron Man puts you under the skin of Tony Stark. He is a billionaire weapon-industrialist and genius inventor who, after being kidnapped by terrorists who want to force him to build weapons for them, builds an armor instead to escape. Since then, he decided to stop producing weapons and keeps on working on the suit to fight them back. The games take the story further, giving the player the chance to go through more than 12 different missions and even fight villains that do not appear on the movie, like Whiplash and Titanium Man. All this is shown through cinematics between every mission and use the voices of actors of the movie like Robert Downey Jr. and Terrence Howard. By foot or by air, with the first armor at the beginning and in the characteristic red and gold suit later, using range weapons or melee attacks, the game features Stark fighting with armies of soldiers, tanks, helicopters, canons, etc. with the help of an array of upgradeable weapons like missiles, micro-grenades, repulsive shots, EMP blasts, a flame thrower and the powerful Unibeam. Both the weapons and the suit (propulsion and armor systems) are upgradeable, and there are many special armors from the comics to unlock in most of the versions. Differences in this version from the Xbox360/PS3 version consist of altered visuals and altered upgrade system (rather than spending money on them, the player&apos;s gear is upgraded based on how much it has been used).</story>

    <story>Island Xtreme Stunts is a mixture of different genres in a single game. The player explores a LEGO-based environment in an open world format- ride a skateboard, drive, fly and pilot a range of vehicles all whilst performing stunts and tricks while taking on the bad guy, Brickster. The player is cast as Pepper Roni, a lead stuntman in a big movie production set on LEGO Island. Even though the player is free to go wherever he wants, there is a story behind the game divided over 25 missions. All the missions are stunt-based. Running around the world in 3rd-person view, the controls are pretty basic and do not offer the trick combinations of other stunt/trick-based games. It is easy to pick up and play, even for the younger players, without worrying too much about what button combination will do what trick. Instead the player can focus on the missions by only having to complete basic tricks with a few button presses. During the quests players can collect trading cards to unlock mini-games. Other features include bricks to create Brickimals and the ability to change LEGO Island objects.</story>

    <story>In his second adventure James Pond must retrieve the toys Dr Maybe has stolen. Pond has been armed with an Inspector Gadget-style stretch device, which he can use to view higher areas or claw onto ceilings so as to slide across them. The gameplay takes place across worlds themed around particular types of toys, such as sporting goods, candy and aircraft. The levels scroll sideways, although a small amount of vertical movement is included. On each level Pond must collect 2 penguins and reach the exit, although there are usually multiple exits and lots of secret areas to explore. After completing each pair of two worlds (each of which has three sub levels), a boss must be faced.</story>

    <story>The classic TV game show, now interactive. The game is played by picking a dollar amount under a category (Let&apos;s say Video Games), getting presented with an answer (This user-contributed database contains information about thousands of games.), to which the player who buzzes in first attempts to provide the correct question (What is MobyGames?). If the question is correct, the player earns that amount of money; otherwise they lose it. If they happen to select one of the rare Daily Doubles, the player instead wagers as much of their current earnings as they wish. In the second round, Double Jeopardy!, dollar values on the board are doubled. In the third round, Final Jeopardy!, there is only one answer. After learning the category each player wagers as much of their earnings as they desire. The player who ends the game with the most money wins. This version of the game has more than 5,200 answers. In this version, players can keep a saved profile which keeps track of their name (written by analog stick) as well as statistics on such things as how many answers they&apos;ve correctly and incorrectly responded to, and the most money they&apos;ve earned in a game. As in most console versions of Jeopardy!, players enter their questions by selecting letters with the analog stick or control pad. After several letters have been picked, it will start presenting options for you to pick to save time. For instance, typing in KEL may present options such as KELLOG&apos;S or KELSEY GRAMMER.</story>

    <story>Juiced is a racing game, set in the fictive Angel City, that embraces the lifestyle and culture of street racing and tuning, similar to Need for Speed Underground, with slick, fully customizable cars, fast races, gaining respect and betting. The arcade mode offers quick races and in the custom mode you can set up events with unlocked cars and tracks. There are 52 vehicles from known manufacturers to acquire, and the game boasts a total of 7.5 trillion car customization possibilities. To make available all cars, tracks and parts, you need to progress in the career mode, where you build cars and participate in racing events to earn cash and respect. Aside from the traditional circuit and point-to-point races, there are also drag races (sprints) and show-offs with difficult maneuvers requiring advanced driving techniques. When you achieve acclaim in the career mode, some of the eight racing crews in Angel City will offer a position on their team. Each crew has specific challenges and crew racing introduces additional gameplay elements. You have to organize events by phone, gamble, and race opponents for their cars (pink slip races). The team leader&apos;s respect is controlled by the amount of damage given and sustained (distress, which also affects the car&apos;s performance) and your personal car collection. In team races, there is a strategic element as you can control your team members&apos; aggressiveness in-game. Up to six player can race in the multiplayer mode, in which pink slip races, based on the car collection from the offline career mode, are also available. Statistics are organized on a world ranking server, with record times from singleplayer games and a rating based on your online performance. Ratings can be improved by beating higher-ranked players or multiple drivers in a single race.</story>

In 1983 an expedition to the Bermuda Triangle disappeared, but almost 30 years later the daughter of Dr. Sayrus, one of the original members, receives the S.O.S. transmission of the long lost team. Dylan is a part of the team hired to investigate, but their plane is struck by a storm and all members need to parachute down, where they are sucked into mysterious energy portals. Craig Dylan suddenly finds himself on an island filled with dinosaurs. The environment is filled with dense jungle, fortifications and volcano areas. Players need to fight thirteen different types of dinosaurs such as the velociraptor, pterosaur, triceratops, tyrannosaurus and many more. Aside from the straightforward shoot-em-up gameplay, Dylan also has access to an Adrenaline Burst that slows down all the action for more accurate shots. It also lights up the dinosaurs&apos; weak spots in a bright color. The thirteen weapons at his disposal range from a civil war rifle, to crossbows with explosive arrows and even a futuristic plasma rifle. There are also a number of stationary turrets to ward off large hordes. Next to the regular story mode with twelve levels in total, there is a survivor mode where the player can go against an endless wave of dinosaurs. During the regular mode scattered pieces of a new weapons can be found and when it is fully assembled it becomes available in the survivor mode.</story>

Similar to the first movie, you can lay down electric fences. Some fences have a higher electric discharge than others, and are meant for the bigger dinosaurs. While a 100 volt fence might keep a raptor safe, it might take a 500 volt fence to keep a T-Rex from escaping. You have various buildings at your disposal, from the standard restaurant and bathroom to gift stalls and photo booths. You can opt to construct a safari tour, like what took place in the first movie. You even have the ability to take the tour yourself, and see your park as your visitors see it. One of the most important objects is the Ranger Station. With this building, you can have helicopters patrol your park to watch for any disasters. If a dino should escape, you have the option of entering the helicopter in a first person view to try to shoot the dino with a tranquilizer dart. If you want to stick to building only, you can let the AI capture the dino. In order to breed a dinosaur, you must hire a team to locate fossils, then you must have the fossils analyzed. The whole process takes a while, but the longer you let your teams work, the longer your dino will live, and the happier your visitors will be. Force the team to give you the results early, and your dino might only live for ten days. The different dino&apos;s require different resources. Herbivores require lots of trees and grass, while carnivores require goats and cows. Your carnivores may get tired of being fed, so you might have to send in a smaller sized dino (a raptor in a T-Rex pen, for example), for the larger dino to hunt. The game includes multiple camera angles. You can rotate 360 degrees, zoom in and out, enter visitor cam, ride on the safari, take a scenic tour in a hot air balloon, or look out the helicopter. Also included is a comphrensive guide to dinosaurs, geared to help you figure out what each dino likes and dislikes, and how to make them happy, as well as a brief history of each specific dino.</story>

    <story>You are Rico Rodriguez, a CIA-agent who is sent to the small Island of San Esperito to start a revolution and bring down the current regime under the rule of General Salvador Mendoza. After you jumped out of the airplane and helped your local contact survive an attack by gang members, you have - much like GTA- San Andreas - the freedom to do what you want. The complete island is accessible from the beginning and you can either follow the main storyline, engage in side-missions, or collect items all over the place. To help the revolution you can also drive the government out of the individual sectors on the island. This is accomplished by a three-stages fight in which you have to go up against a huge army of government forces. As a fully trained agent, Rico can also perform many stunts. He has always an parachute equipped which he can open whenever he has enough speed. So he often uses cars or bikes as a jump-pad and then sails smoothly into the sunset. But of course he cannot impress the evil regime with that, so he also has access to a wide range of weapons from pistols with unlimited ammo to rocket launchers and machine guns. Rico is also trained to drive everything that has an engine, from a normal bike to a fully-armed military helicopter.</story>

    <story>Military robots cause havoc in a high tech Metropolis research facility. In Finland, genetically-engineered creatures take over the top secret Deep Space Communications Array. A team of super powered criminals, having never worked together before, seize a Nevada missile base. And deep beneath the surface of Mars, dozens of alien warriors are released from their long imprisonment… These seemingly unrelated events prove to be pieces of a sinister plan, and it will take Earth’s greatest superheroes to stop it- The Justice League! Justice League Heroes is an action game, also for two players cooperatively, based on the popular DC Comics series. Control DC’s most popular heroes- Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, The Flash, Zatanna and a handful of unlockable characters like Aquaman, Green Arrow, Hawkgirl, Huntress, Hal Jordan, and Kyle Rayner. In addition, the PSP version features exclusive unlockable heroes- Supergirl and Black Canary. Players battle through famous locations such as Metropolis, S.T.A.R. labs, and for the first time, the Justice League&apos;s Watchtower. Many of DC’s greatest villains face against our heroes including Braniac, Killer Frost, Darkseid, and Doomsday. Boss battles are furious and unique, with no two defeated the same way. Superpowers are developed through experience orbs collected from a wide range of enemies such as The White Martians, Brainiac’s assassin droids, and alternate-dimensional creatures. Some special orbs known as “boosts” can enhance superpowers. The boosts range from enhanced damage, efficiency, attack range, luck, speed, and super power duration. Multiple boosts can combine into a single, more powerful boost. Players can allocate their orbs and boosts to customize heroes to best suit their playing style. Special shield icons placed throughout the game can be collected and spent to unlock characters and alternate costumes which affect the heroes&apos; abilities as well their appearances.</story>

    <story>Kaido Racer is a fast-paced racing title that faithfully recreates highly dangerous courses from some of Japan&apos;s most famous mountain regions. Each race is fought against a number of computer-controlled drivers (or a friend in two-player mode), and mixes official daytime tournaments with more lucrative night-time events. Kaido features four &apos;Battle&apos; events that you must master in order to earn enough cash to upgrade your vehicle. In &apos;SP Battle&apos;, you must keep a special gauge as full as possible by staying in the lead and driving aggressively; &apos;CA Battle&apos; rewards masterful drifting; &apos;FL/LF Battle&apos; challenges you to either stay in first place, or claw your way to the front from last place; and &apos;TAC Battle&apos; adds a strict time limit to SP Battle rules. Kaido Racer also features a story mode where you&apos;ll meet rival drivers such as Slasher, Tricker and Lovers, all of whom have driving styles to reflect their personalities. You&apos;ll communicate with them via a simple simulated mail system, picking up tips and sending out challenges using the message boards. </story>

In order to bribe the guard and get aboard Hunter&apos;s ship, Kao must collect lots of coins scattered throughout the game. The main character can fight with his boxing gloves and can throw lethal boomerangs. The game consists of 25 levels in 5 different worlds. Playing through the levels, the player must jump over platforms, make difficult leaps, and fight about 30 different types of enemies, free captured friends and solve many puzzles. Occasionally Kao will get to ride a vehicle like a barrel or a snowmobile. Kao can also find purple crystals, which can be spent to buy minigames to play. There are also stars - collecting 50 of them will upgrade one of Kao&apos;s abilities, e.g. giving him the ability to stomp on the ground to defeat enemies around him. A rarely encountered item is a winged helmet, which, when grabbed, allows Kao to fly for a short while.</story>

It&apos;s like Dance Dance Revolution, but with singing instead of dancing. Players sing using the Logitech PS2 Headset (or other approved Playstation 2 USB microphone devices).

A visual indicator shows the player&apos;s current pitch in real-time and also the pitch of vocals of the original song. If the original notes of the song are too high for the player&apos;s vocal range, the game allows the player to sing at higher or lower octaves to hit the correct notes. If the player sings well, the crowd gets into the performance by clapping, cheering and dancing. If the performance is bad, the audience becomes bored and the user can get booed off the stage. Single Player Game Modes include- - Arcade Mode- where users sing 3-5 songs are try to score big points - Showtime Mode- Players start at a Living Room Party and work to a huge concert at the Enormobowl.

In addition to the standard Karaoke Revolution trapping, three judges have been added who comment on your performance. Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson appear from American Idol, though Paula Abdul is replaced by original character Laura. Venues are also recreated from the show such as the audition room and Hollywood theater. The forty-song line-up is a combination of popular songs that have been used on American Idol and songs from previous American Idol winners. Performing well unlocks video clips from the show and clothes for your avatar. You can use EyeToy to give your character your own face. Modes include the standard Karaoke Revolution modes like scoreless karaoke, duets and head-to-head elimination as well as an American Idol mode, which is essentially a career mode based on the structure of the show where you must make it through the audition and several rounds of elimination to get into the contest, then make your way to the top to be the next American Idol.</story>

Each version has the ability to customize their character with an assortment of clothing, however the PS3 and PS2 has the ability to use the Eyetoy device to put a 3-D model of the players head into the game or the PS3 can use the Playstation Eye to directly put the player into the game. Likewise the PS3 and 360 version has online capabilities to download over 140 songs using their respective online providers.</story>

    <story>The King of All Cosmos accidentally destroyed the stars and—having recovered—wants the prince to rebuild them. Unfortunately the prince stands a little less than half a foot tall, so recreating the stars will require some effort. Enter the Katamari, a sphere the prince can push around our world to “roll up” items increasing the Katamari’s size until it’s suitable for the King. Taking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items. Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamari’s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions. The world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack. Players can find presents hidden in the levels that contain accessories for the prince. Two players can also battle head-to-head in a Katamari competition.</story>

    <story>Do you like to surf? Have you ever imagined surfing at different remote locations around the world? Well, Kelly Slater takes you around the world on his boat to surf some of the more famous beaches. With a control scheme similar to all the other Activision O2 brand games, it&apos;s easy to jump into the game and surf. PS2, XB, and GC description, further below is the GBA description. Game Play Modes- Infinite Time - With no clock, no objectives, and nobody around, this gives you the best opportunity to just enjoy the surf. High Score - With 3 minutes, how high of a score can you get? Icon Challenge - See how many icons you can collect and how high of a score you can get before time runs out. Career Mode - Select a surfer and journey around the world to surf the best waves on the best beaches. As you progress you will unlock new beaches, new surf boards, and new tricks which will be usable in all the other modes of play. Multiplayer Modes- Push - Two players surf simultaneously in an attempt to push the split screen towards their opponent&apos;s half of the screen. As you score points the screen gets pushed more. The winner is decided once one player is pushed from the screen. Head to Head - Similar to Push but the screen is stationary and the winner is the person with the highest points when the time runs out. Time Attack - Players take turns to achieve the most points possible. The more points you get the less time is alloted to your opponent. The Pros in the game- Kelly Slater, Lisa Andersen, Tom Carroll, Tom Curren, Nathan Fletcher, Donavon Frankenreiter, Bruce Irons, Rob Machado, Kalani Robb, and some other secret characters. The beaches in the game- Sebastian, Trestles, Mavericks, Antarctica, Jaws, Pipeline, Teahupoo, Bells, Curren&apos;s Point, Kirra, G-Land, J-Bay, Mundaka, Cortez Bank, and perhaps some other tucked-away hide-aways. The PS2 version of the game also includes a playable demo of Tony Hawk&apos;s Pro Skater 4 GBA description Surf Modes- Championship - Compete against 8 other surfers. You progress by surfing in 12 stages, 3 heats per stage. Your surf score is tallied from each heat and the top 3 surfers of the stage get to move on.

    <story>A strategy game that tells the story of the events that brought feudal Japan out of a century of civil war and installed the Tokugawa Shogunate as the dominant political entity for the next two hundred years. As either Tokugawa Ieyasu or his opponents, you&apos;ll engage in real time battles, including Sekigahara, one of the largest and most famous battles in Japanese history. Victory or defeat will stear you down a campaign trail, taking you either through the historical events of the time or down fictional &apos;what if?&apos; scenarios. Battles take place in real time, with you instructing your various generals on where to lead their troops, who to engage, and what special actions to perform. These special actions, such as firing your cannons, charging your opponent, or unleashing a flight of arrows, are depicted in close-up, cinema-like cut-scenes. Before, after, and sometimes even during battles you&apos;ll be shown cut-scenes that depict the personal struggles of your various subordinates. This supplies the battles with story and drama. Koh Shibusawa, the head designer and producer of this project, even states in the opening screen that his goal was to try to create an interactive war movie.</story>

    <story>The player takes control of Nobunaga Oda, and unlike in previous two games, you cannot choose side to play on, and Nobunaga has one goal only... to unify the lands and rid his world of misery and suffering. Following the prequels, this game comes with lots of cinematics and stays true to strategic as well as action gameplay, adding a few new things along the road, like collecting items during battles. Two main aspects of this game are planning and engaging in the battle. Planning lets you select your officers and strategically place them on the field of battle, assign commands and issue orders. When on the battle, each of your officers, including Nobunaga, will have his/her army at disposal of which you can take control at any point during the battle. Depending on your troop skills, you can perform special attacks, and your officers level up after each battle and have special abilities of their own to use in battle.</story>

In a strange turn of events, an underground kingpin unleashes a wave of violence with a invisible suicide army called Heaven&apos;s Smile. The unlikely hero to face this threat is the crippled 65 year-old wheelchair-bound Harman Smith. Smith is schizophrenic and you assume one of his seven different personalities throughout the game. Each character has unique abilities. Dan, for example, is a true marksman, while Coyote is an experienced thief with exceptional movement. The unusual cast also includes the blind Con who moves very fast, Kaede with ranged skills, Mask who has the deadliest arsenal and the albino Kevin who can turn invisible. Garcian is the leader of the pack and the only one who can communicate with Harman and revive the bodies of slain personalities. During the game, you can change characters at any time and any place. Depending of the persona you play with, Killer7 mixes stealth and adventure with pure action. It carries a surreal atmosphere with eclectic music, but a politically charged and thought-provoking story with some goofy humour as well.</story>

Each environment theme has its own resident ‘Course Pro’ resplendent in suitably themed fancy dress costume. There are 4 single player modes (Career, Tournament, Speed Golf, Practice). As you progress through the game, you’ll unlock special balls and clubs which enable you to play different types of shots (e.g. chip clubs, swerve clubs, rubber balls, speed balls). Combinations of these balls and clubs then allow you to approach holes in different ways and attempt various trick shots to try and get a hole in one (which is possible on every hole). In multi-player, you can play against up to 3 friends. The multi-player game features specific pickups which can help you &amp; hinder your opponents as well as a ‘distraction’ feature which allows non-active players to trigger sound effects &amp; rumble the pad of the player currently taking a shot. The game also features a ‘Pro-Shop’ where buy various gadgets to customise various elements of the game such as the colour of your ball, its trail and even the sound effects it makes when you hit it.</story>

    <story>The final King of Fighters game released by SNK in its original state, The King of Fighters 2000 expands on the story and gameplay presented in The King of Fighters &apos;99. This year&apos;s tournament is sponsored by the Ikari Warriors in an attempt to discover more about the NESTS organization, and to derail the plans of potential NESTS agents K&apos; and Maxima. Not everything is as straight-forward as it usually is, however, and even the Ikari Warriors themselves are at risk of being betrayed from within by the end of the tournament. The King of Fighters 2000 features a roster of 34 fighters plus 2 unlockable boss characters. The four-man teams and the striker system introduced during the previous year return in this year&apos;s tournament, with the striker system itself receiving significant improvement. One change in particular is the alternate striker system, where every fighter in the game now has another character linked to him or her that may be chosen instead of the normal character for striking purposes. For example, one may elect to use Iori Yagami&apos;s alternate striker instead of using Iori himself; in his case, the player could elect to choose and use his old teammates Mature and Vice for striker duty instead. Some characters also have hidden maniac striker with strange (but potentially useful) abilities.</story>

    <story>In this eighth installment of the King of Fighters series, ten different teams once again battle it out in several countries to decide which team will be this year&apos;s King of Fighters. However, the NESTS organization is once again standing in the participant&apos;s way; they have deployed their own team of four fighters, lead by two individuals of high-rank within NESTS- a man claiming to be the original Zero and Igniz, the CEO of NESTS. The character roster has been updated yet again for this release in the series. Counting the new characters (May Lee, Angel, K9999, Original Zero, Igniz) and returning fighters (such as Heidern and Goro Daimon), The King of Fighters 2001 has 40 normal characters and 2 boss characters to choose from. In terms of gameplay, the system used in The King of Fighters 2000 remains more or less unchanged with the exception of the striker system, which has been redeveloped since that last KOF release. The number of strikers you may have is now fully customizable; you can have as many as 3 characters assigned as strikers and one as a fighter, or assign all 4 of your characters as active fighters. The number of strikers and fighters can be changed after each battle. In addition, the amount of power you can store for special maneuvers and Desperation Moves increases with each character assigned as a striker. A fully active fighting team has only one Power Stock to play with, while a team that is striker-dedicated (save for the single fighter) can access up to four Power Stocks.</story>

    <story>The tenth installment in SNK&apos;s long running King of Fighters series, and the last KOF to appear on the Neo Geo system. This game&apos;s storyline focuses on the unexpected return of the Orochi power, who was thought to have been permenantly sealed away back in 1997 by Kyo Kusanagi, Iori Yagami and Chizuru Kagura. It appears that someone has been tampering with the seal, however... This year there are 30 characters, 2 edit characters (Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami) and 2 hidden characters (Kusanagi from KOF &apos;02 and Chizuru Kagura) to choose from. There are several returning characters (Jhun Hoon, King, Shingo Yabuki, Hinako Shijou, Billy Kane and Ryuji Yamazaki) and few new fighters as well (Ash Crimson, Shen Woo, Duo Lon, Malin, Adelheid Bernstein and Mukai). Like The King of Fighters 2002, this game reverts back to the old 3-on-3 format used from KOF &apos;94 to KOF &apos;98. A new feature to this game that old-school KOF fans might have trouble getting used to is the new interchangeable team system. You still pick three characters and decide your character order before a match, but now you have the option to change to another character during a match. For example, if your character is low on power during a match, you can have either one of the other two characters at your disposal step in and take their place. It also works if you do not like the character that you have selected, or if you are having trouble using that character. You can change at any time during a match, but you cannot when two of your teammates have been taken out, and only one character is left in reserve.</story>

    <story>The eleventh installment in SNK Playmore&apos;s long-running King of Fighters series and the ninth event in the official storyline, The King of Fighters XI is the first game in the series to forego the traditional numbering convention used by the series, and the first game in the series to move beyond the hardware capabilities of the Neo-Geo system. After the controversial resurgence of the Orochi power in the 2003 King of Fighters tournament, the tournament and the fighters return after a two year break in the action. Some are motivated to investigate the new Orochi situation and the antagonistic fighter Ash Crimson, while others enter the tourney to settle old scores... The King of Fighters XI features a roster of 33 team characters, 7 PS2 exclusive characters, 5 mid-boss characters and 2 boss characters. In total, this allows a player to choose between +40 characters. Many of the characters are returning fighters from the other games in the KOF series, though notable new faces exist in the effective forms of Oswald, Duck King, Bonne Jenet, Elisabeth Blanctorche and Gai Tendo. The tag system used in The King of Fighters 2003 is still employed in KOF XI. However, the change in the arcade hardware has brought about many gameplay changes since the 2003 release. A new power stock system - specifically called Skill Stocks - has been added for use with a few extra special maneuvers called Shifts. A character can use a Quick Shift to tag in another fighter while in the middle of a combo, while that character may also use a Saving Shift to tag out if they are on the verge of defeat. Another maneuver, called the Dream Cancel, has also been added to the system. Dream Cancels can be used to interrupt a special move with another one, even allowing a fighter to interrupt a Desperation Move to initiate a Leader Desperation Move. The Time Out system has be revamped as well - the system now takes into account the number of fighters defeated on a team and the number and power of attacks made by a team to reach its verdict.</story>

    <story>This is the third game in the King&apos;s Field series released outside of Japan (fourth in Japan). The story begins when the hero gets a visit from a mysterious stranger. The stranger gives the hero an idol and then vanishes. At once the hero recognizes the idol as the Idol of Sorrow and goes to the land of despair to learn more about it. Shortly before the hero arrives in this land though, a small force led by the prince attempted to reclaim the land again, but most of the men have disappeared. Seek out the forest folk, as legend says they were the creators of the idol and will hopefully know how to remove the curse that is on it. King&apos;s Field is a first-person role-playing game that utilizes both melee and ranged weapons, as well as different magic spells. During gameplay expect to run into many monsters, puzzles, NPCs, and traps. You&apos;ll use the items you collect throughout the game in various places later on. A new and different keystone system is used in this iteration of the series where you can only teleport to designated key stones when near a teleportation circle. Search the runes and discover the story behind the idol.</story>

    <story>Sora&apos;s world is shattered when a violent storm hits his home, and he is separated from his two closest friends. The storm scatters the three to unknown worlds. At the same time, there is turmoil in the Disney Castle. King Mickey is missing, and Court Wizard Donald and Captain Goofy are out to find him. On their travels they meet Sora, on his own search for his lost friends. The three are told of ominous creatures called Heartless, being without hearts derived from an unknown dimension and are the ones responsible for the devastating storm. The Disney villains, enticed by the power of darkness, manipulate the Darkness to help them gather the princesses of heart, who are needed to open a mysterious final door. Upon discovering the link between the Heartless, the storm, and the disappearance of King Mickey, Sora, Donald, and Goofy join forces and help familiar Disney heroes to save their worlds from the Heartless. In Kingdom Hearts players step into the very large shoes of Sora, wielder of the keyblade. Sora can attack with the blade, and as he levels up he will gain more attacks that are automatically chained together. Sora can learn magic and put healing items into a quick menu, and both can only be used in real time. Donald and Goofy (as well as an additional character exclusive to each world/disney movie) will follow Sora. Their equipment and AI can be adjusted, but they can not be directly controlled. Defeated enemies will drop many kinds of items including synthesis materials. Sora can take these to the Synthesis shop in Twilight Town to turn them into usable items, accessories, and weapons. Traveling between each world requires Sora&apos;s party to fly through space in a Gummi Ship. The Gummi Ship can be completely customized, from speed and armor to weapons and shape, out of parts picked up from destroyed Gummi Ships, found in worlds, or bought from a store. Larger, more complex ships can be built as the game progresses, and plans can be found from destroyed enemies or from an NPC that will automatically build a Gummi Ship of specific specifications.</story>

    <story>Sora, Donald, and Goofy are back in the third installment (second for PS2) of the Kingdom Hearts series, continuing where Kingdom Hearts- Chain of Memories left off. The trio awakens from their sleep and goes to Twilight Town. When the game begins, you will first have control over a boy name Roxas who wields a dual-Keyblade. He is trying to enjoy the remainder of his summer vacation with his friends but he keeps having flash-backs of someone else&apos;s memories. When he meets up with Sora, the two learns they have a special connection with one another. Afterwards, the group will continue their search for King Mickey and Riku. This time, they will travel to new worlds and work with various characters from the Disney and Final Fantasy universes. This includes worlds from not only Disney&apos;s animated movies but other movies as well like Pirates of the Caribbean and TRON. In Kingdom Hearts II, Sora and his friends will battle various enemies including the Heartless from Kingdom Hearts, but also a group of enemies called Nobodies. Nobodies are nonexistent beings who are under the control of Organization XIII - a group of 13 members in black coats that Sora and his friends have reduced down to just half. Gameplay is very similar to Kingdom Hearts- the player controls Sora with Donald and Goofy helping with their magic and attacks. Sora can use various magic powers as well as use Summon which will call upon the aid of special Disney characters that will temporarily fight alongside him. A new feature of combat are Reaction Commands. Some enemies will leave themselves open during attacks, and if the player presses the Reaction Command button when prompted Sora will take advantage of the situation, either turning an enemy&apos;s attack against them, striking from a defenseless side for extra damage, or avoiding an otherwise unavoidable attack. As the trio levels up and progresses in the game they will gain new abilities that they can equip. Also, after Mickey meets the party, if Sora is KO&apos;d the player will have the option of controlling Mickey and defending Sora until he can recover. Another new feature is the Drive gauge. When filled and activated Sora absorbs the strength of his allies and gains new powers, like long range magical bullets in Magician form or the ability to use two keyblades in Strength form. Using Drive forms will power them up, unlocking new abilities and allowing them to be used for longer periods of time. The Gummi Ship returns, but the speed of combat during Gummi Ship level has been greatly increased. While the path of the Gummi Ship is still out of the player&apos;s control, the ship can now attack enemies to the front, sides, and behind. Gummi Ship levels can be re-challenged at different difficulty levels, with different levels offering greater challenge and new enemy patterns. Achieving high scores in these levels rewards new Gummi Ship parts and plans.</story>

    <story>Kingdom Heart Re-Chain of Memories is the PS2 remake of the GBA game Kingdom Hearts- Chain of Memories. It was initially released as a part of Kingdom Hearts II- Final Mix+ and only later made available as a standalone game. The most important change is that the world and battles are now in full 3d, including voice acting and a full soundtrack. Basic gameplay elements such as the battle system based on cards remain identical, but with additions such as the Reaction Command from Kingdom Hearts II. There are also a number of new cutscenes and entirely new battles, such as the fight with Zexion in Reverse/Rebirth. Upon completing the game, all cutscenes can be viewed in chronological order in the Theater Mode.</story>

    <story>Klonoa, our floppy-eared hero, along with his two newly found buddies, Lolo and Popka, have to foil a sinister force which is causing a mire of gloom to plague the land of Lunatea. By ringing the four bells across the land, Klonoa can restore harmony, but the Sky Pirate Leorina is in hot pursuit, after Klonoa&apos;s magic ring... Klonoa 2- Lunatea&apos;s Veil is a 3D side-scrolling platformer. The main goal of the game is to get to the end of each level (or &apos;Vision&apos;), but there are also special goals to achieve. Firstly, each Vision contains six Momett Dolls hidden in each level. Secondly, there are Dream Stones scattered throughout each level - green ones are worth one, while blue ones are worth five. Certain puzzles also contain tricky use of the Dream Spirit, which doubles the value of all collected Dream Stones. New to Klonoa 2 are hoverboard sections, which play at a faster, more action-oriented pace. But what makes Klonoa unique is his abilities. Klonoa can shoot a &apos;wind bullet&apos; into foes, which puffs them up and allows Klonoa to carry them. Klonoa can then launch them straight at foes, or jump with them, giving him an extra boost. If he needs extra length to his jump, holding the jump button will allow him to hover for a little longer, too. Different enemies have different effects - for example, certain foes have propellers on their heads and will rocket you into the sky, while others will act like time bombs and explode after a short while.</story>

The player can also use various original functions of the car, like Turbo Boost, Super Pursuit Mode, Ski Mode or the famous Scanner, whose sound everyone should recognise. The game can only be played in campaign mode, where KITT and Michael have to solve a mysterious case, starting out as a simple bank robbery.</story>

    <story>In the sequel to Knight Rider- The Game, Michael and KITT are targeted by a missile attack while driving back to the foundation. They barely survive and set up a meeting with the base. On their way home however, they notice unusual black marks in demolished villages, and decide to investigate. All missions have the player control KITT, who has now been equipped with three weapons- a lock-on laser, a plasma gun, and missiles. There is also turbo boost to jump over obstacles, micro jam to scan items and recharge, the ski mode to drive on two wheels through narrow passages, super pursuit mode for faster speed, and a shield to block incoming attacks. When damaged or running low on energy, certain functions are disabled. The different missions are linked by sequences where the story is further explained using the in-game engine. Many familiar characters from the tv series make an appearance, such as Bonnie, Devon, Garth and KARR. Missions either focus on racing or exploration. In the first type, the player mainly evades attacks while racing on a highway. The latter has the player drive inside closed areas, maneuvering through passages and fighting robots. There are also a few puzzle elements where the player has to locate terminals, shoot an object in the environment, or find enemies&apos; weaknesses. When a stunt is performed, the action slows down and the camera switches to a spectacular angle. Next to the main story mode, the individual missions can be replayed in the mission mode. The player can also unlock TV scenes, view background information about the series, or do a quiz.</story>

    <story>In Knights of the Temple II, you again play the role of a Templar knight- Paul de Raque, the grandmaster of the Order of the Temple. The game is set in medieval 13th century Europe and the Middle East. The story revolves around the new crusade of our hero to recover 3 ancient pagan artifacts essential to prevent the imminent attack of the demon armies into our realm of existence. It is a 3D 3rd-person action game with RPG elements. Gameplay consists of completing quests through travelling in the various locations in the game or battling your way through enemy men and monsters. The storyline for one is non-linear. At the start of the game you can choose 1 out of 3 locations to visit. Advancing in the game will unlock new locations. Each location is either a city or town where you can advance in the primary mission, obtain sub-quests, trade, meet people, etc. or it could be a dungeon type location crawling with monsters. Often its a little combination of both. Most of the gameplay (when not exploring cities) revolve around combat and character development. Combat consists of 3D 3rd Person Perspective point of view where you can attack enemies using various skills, abilities and attack combo&apos;s. Each of which can be upgraded at any point of the game by spending experience points to the pointed skill, ability or combo. On character development, there are 3 major areas that may be upgraded- (1) Knightly Abilities; Spiritually oriented gifts of the Templar knight- from healing to other holy abilities. (2) Skill Abilities; These are usually attack-based skills. Various attacking styles to soften and defeat both men and monster. (3) Combo&apos;s. The extension of the attack button. Upgrading the combo section provides additional attack moves. Combat also is uniquely divided into 3 different weapons. The first is the standard Sword and Shield, providing high defense and standard attack, useful in defensive stances and vs. ranged enemies; The second is the 2-handed weapon, primary for direct damage in close-combat against single or multiple enemies; The third is ranged combat using a crossbow. The perspective in ranged combat diverts to 1st person perspective (though you can still see your head). During the course of the game, you can obtain additional weapons and armor (as well as other items), either from the course of a sub-quest or purchasing it from a local trader.</story>

    <story>Kuon is a horror game set in Heian period (12th century) in Japan. You control three protagonists in the game. The story revolves around a man named Doman, an exorcist who was summoned by one of the noblemen to investigate a cursed manor. His daughter Utsuki is out to search for him when he doesn&apos;t return, and her sister is charmed by demons inhabiting a mysterious castle, turning into a demon herself. A young girl named Sakuya, Doman&apos;s disciple, also ventures into the depths of the demonic world, to prove herself worthy of her master. Once the player completes Utsuki&apos;s and Sakuya&apos;s scenarios, he unlocks the third scenario where he experiences the story from the point of view of Doman himself. This is a mixture of third-person action and puzzle-solving adventure. As in all survival horror games, your means of defense are limited and scarce. Unlike most games of the kind, physical attacks with weapons are not your only way to defend yourself against hordes of undead creatures. You can also learn and cast spells in the game, and even summon creatures (wolves, spiders, etc.) to fight at your side.</story>

    <story>Kya and her brother Frank have been transported into a different dimension, and upon arriving are separated! Kya meets (and is saved by) the native creatures of this world (known as the Nativs), however Frank is captured by a dangerous enemy known as the Wolfens under the rule of Brazul. To make matters worse, Kya learns that the Wolfens are actually the peaceful Nativs which have been captured and transformed, and Brazul is actually her long lost father! Kya must now embark on a quest to rescue her brother as well as find a way to restore the Wolfen to their Nativ form and defeat Brazul. Kya- Dark Lineage is an action adventure game. You control Kya and need to explore the colorful world she&apos;s arrived in. This strange world consists of various floating islands with many tunnels, platforms, dangerous life forms, and other obstacles. Powerful winds blow around many areas, and you&apos;ll often need to use the winds to your advantage by floating in them through tunnels, over gaps or slowing your descent in a free fall. There is some puzzle solving as well; you&apos;ll need to locate objects to use, hop on various platforms, buy items in the Nativ city, and more to reach new areas. You&apos;ll also need to fight often, as the Wolfen are numerous and can found guarding many areas you need to get through. You can fight with your fists as well as items that can be acquired (such as various boomies, or boomerangs, and fighting bracelets). After defeating a Wolfen, you can use a magic spell to transform it back to its Nativ form which will then return back to the Nativ city. Upon returning to the city, many of the Nativs will then open up a shop; as new shops are opened, you will have the opportunity to buy new items and power ups to help on your quest. Alternatively, some Nativs may instead build a challenge in the city instead of opening a shop. You can earn money by betting and completing challenge objectives (or you can simply practice a challenge). As you progress through the game, the story will unfold until you are (hopefully) successful in your quest!</story>

Recalling what she can of the past few hours, she remembers walking in on a killer after discovering the body of Von Croy, her friend and former mentor. She must make a hasty escape from the authorities who blame her for the crime. Determined to discover the fiend responsible, Lara eventually uncovers an evil plot that could cause the destruction of mankind.

You&apos;ll have her running, dodging, performing flying leaps and platform jumps, shimming along walls and cables, as well as moving boxes and other obstacles around. Advancements are achieved with strategically placed power-ups. Collect weapons and ammunition, artifacts and money. You&apos;ll also play Kurtis Trent, a new male counterpart, for several levels.

Of course, Lupin is having none of that, and tries to rescue Fujiko himself, but winds up cursed by an ancient black art, which will kill him in three days.

    <story>While games of the Pro Cycling Manager series attempt to recreate the feeling of being a Pro/Continental Tour cycling team manager, Tour de France- Centenary Edition is all about providing the thrills of being a cyclist, starting from the end of the peloton and making way to get a chance at victory. The game is licensed by the Tour de France, and features many real teams and cyclists in six stages, some of which available in reverse mode. Due to the nature of the name, this changes drastically the nature of the tracks - what can be a perfect track for climbers becomes one for the technical riders (with good breaking and turning abilities) in reverse. While the game provides a much simplified arcade experience, it plays a lot differently from games featuring motor vehicles. The player has a limited stamina bar, which decreases as the player goes faster to break away from the current group or pedals harder to beat a steeper hill. In order to replenish it, he can drink a limited number of water-bottles, use down slope sections or, the key to a successful stage, use opponents&apos; and team-mates slipstreams. However, this is not all without risks - down slope sections can be tricky due to the enormous speeds, and colliding takes stamina as well as time (and eventually, might force a retirement), and slipstreams are not always available or big enough. As cycling is also a team sport, the player can request a team-mate to slipstream him during a break, or to give him additional water bottles. They are also easier to slipstream, as they won&apos;t break away if the player close too long. Also playing a huge part on the race is the weather - rain makes pedalling much harder and increase the breaking distance noticeably, while fog reduces stamina loss, but players must be careful not to overdo speed due to limited viewing distance. Game modes include training, arcade, time trials and the Tour de France, a career mode where the player can start a 5-year plan to become the world&apos;s number one cyclist by winning local races, which allows to afford better bike parts and training sessions. Parts affect mostly how well the player controls the bike, but as the game simulates the stage until the final miles, the starting position in the peloton is defined by the training, so a player who has a top bike but neglected training will struggle to perform well in the Tour de France, as instead of starting in the top 40 will start in 80th or even worse, losing precious time and both sprint and mountain points in the process.</story>

    <story>Tour de France is an arcade racing game based on the premier road cycling event in the world. The game features 5 different game modes- Arcade. where the player competes freely on any of available tracks, Tour de France, where the player aims to win the prestigious competition in five years, by training and winning enough money to afford better bike parts and training sessions, Time Trial (racing against the clock) and train basic skills. As the player is controlling a bike, it isn&apos;t just a matter of pressing down the throttle button and avoid other competitors while keeping the best possible trajectory. While the last two are still as important, the player must pace according to the stamina of the racer. While it can be partially replenished using water bottles, to win races the player must use downward slopes to gain velocity while still recovering stamina as well as taking advantage of the slipstream of other riders. While losing all stamina won&apos;t immediately abort the race, the rider will stop and put a feet down until it recovers to an acceptable level, making any chance of a good result impossible. The race will stop, however, once the damage (sustained by hitting other riders of fences at high speeds) is greater than half of the stamina bar. It was followed by Tour de France- Centenary Edition.</story>

    <story>Following the events of Legacy of Kain- Soul Reaver 2, Raziel and Kain were trapped in the Serafan fortress. Separated by sudden events, Raziel was forced to retreat into the spectral realm, leaving Kain to escape from the Serafan on his own. Both must escape the predicament they find themselves in and fight back against those who would seek to use them as manipulations in a grander plot. From both heroes cry out shouts of defiance, and a thirst to find the revelations that have been buried in the world of Nosgoth. Legacy of Kain- Defiance is a 3rd person action-adventure game, combining concepts seen in both Blood Omen 2 and Soul Reaver 2. The story unfolds through chapters, focusing alternately on Kain and Raziel as they pursue their separate, though intertwined quests. Control of each character alternates between levels, however both are controlled from a behind-the-shoulder perspective. While both heroes are different, they are similar in movement, ability to attack, defend, jump and access special abilities. Kain and Raziel no longer pick up weapons, instead both using a form of the Soul Reaver weapon (Kain uses the physical sword form, Raziel uses an energy blade). Each Soul Reaver can now be charged to unleash a special ability, determined by the current alignment of Soul Reaver at the time. Both Kain and Raziel lose energy at a constant rate and must feed to replenish life energy (Kain feeds on the blood of living creatures, Raziel feeds on the souls of living and non-living creatures). And both Kain and Raziel feature telekinetic abilities to manipulate objects at a distance. Kain and Raziel are different characters however, that play differently, each requiring use of his talents,to bypass obstacles (sometimes the same obstacle). Kain focuses on strong combat and destructive abilities. He is able able to power up the Soul Reaver weapon using properties of the Pillars of Nosgoth. Raziel is more subtle, able to use stealth and the phasing between material and spectral worlds in order to discover new paths. As in Soul Reaver, Raziel can phase into the spectral world at any time but must find a special location in order to phase back. Raziel powers up the Soul Reaver using elemental powers.</story>

    <story>Legend of Kay is a classic action adventure with an advanced close combat fighting system. The young hero Kay, a cat, rise to a challenge when emperor Shun - king of the mighty gorilla - invaded the island Yenching with his troops. Kay may be only a scholar, but he is a brave and agile fighter. He leaves his village only with his sword and soon becomes a seasoned fighter. The fights in Legend of Kay reminds of good old eastern martial-arts-movies. There are various moves the player can execute- uppercuts, back flips, somersaults, powerful magic attacks and you have the combo moves. When you gain a combo, you can auto aim at enemies, which makes it easy for the player to execute double- and triple blows. In the beginning you only have a sword but later in the game Kay receives steel claws and a powerful war hammer. All weapons can be upgraded. Kay has to fight against a lot of different enemies on ground and in the air. There are a lot of jump and run action, puzzles and of course many, many fights.</story>

    <story>The Legend of Spyro- A New Beginning deals with Spyro&apos;s birth and his journey to meet his destiny. The intro shows Spyro being rescued by a Guardian Dragon called Ignitus from the attack of the Dark Master. After his eclosion, Spyro is raised by dragonflies in a swamp until one day he discovers that he is in fact a dragon, and he and his half-brother, the dragonfly Sparx, leave the swamp to find out more about Spyro&apos;s past and fight the forces of evil. In contrast to previous Spyro games the emphasis is put on combat instead of platforming. Spyro can do several combat moves, using both his tail and his claws, and has four different breath attacks- fire, electricity, ice and earth. The game also features several rail shooter passages similar to games like Panzer Dragoon.</story>

    <story>Dawn of the Dragon is the third and final chapter of the Legend of Spyro trilogy. It starts when Spyro and Cynder are freed from their crystalline prison. They are former foes, but the Dark Master binds them through green energy chains. After escaping their prison with Sparx and Hunter, they are shown what the Dark Master has done after he escaped from the Well of Souls during the Night of Eternal Darkness. They travel through Dragon City, the Burned Lands and the Floating Islands to confront Malefor at his lair. Just like the previous game, Dawn of the Dragon is a third-person action game with a focus on fighting and exploration even though progress is entirely linear. New to the series is the ability to fly at any time. This edition also provides a cooperative mode with Spyro and Cynder and with just a single player it is possible to switch between them at any time. Spyro attacks with fire, electricity, earth and ice, while Cynder controls poison, fear, wind and shadow. Collected gems provide power-ups and both characters can also equip pieces of dragon armour. Gems include blue ones to upgrade moves, red ones restore health, and green ones make available element attacks through dragon magic. The amount of blue ones provided is based on a melee combo system. Fury gems have been removed. They are replaced with dark crystals that need to be destroyed as they drain magic. Fury is now determined through a meter that fills up during attacks. Next to the regular enemies there are now elite enemies that were a mask with a certain colour. A specific attack is needed to get rid off the mask and then regular attacks become effective.</story>

    <story>Spyro wakes up late one night to discover that his rescued friend, Cynder, is running away from the temple where they live. Spyro (and reluctantly, his friend Sparx) chase after her. Little do they know that they are in for another adventure, where they will meet the mysterious Chronicler and eventually face off against Gaul, the Ape King. The Legend of Spyro- The Eternal Night is a 3D action platformer which takes place right after the events at the end of The Legend of Spyro- A New Beginning. Players control Spyro as he searches for his friend Cynder. Initially, he has lost all of his different breath powers from the first game, but he gradually recovers the ability to breathe fire, ice, earth and electricity. New to this game is the ability for Spyro to slow down time using his newly-learned &apos;Dragon Time&apos; ability. While the game has some basic puzzles involving pressing switches, the main focus is still around fighting. Spryo&apos;s primary attack is his headbutt, but he can also use his assorted breaths to defeat foes provided that he has enough magic power. He also earns blue gems from defeating foes which will allow him to level up his powers.</story>

    <story>Continuing the tradition of adapting known franchises such as Star Wars and Indiana Jones with visuals based on LEGO, this game takes on the Batman universe. The basic concept is the same, with characters and objects built up using LEGO blocks, but here shown against surroundings drawn in a regular fashion. Most of the environments are side-scrolling with a fixed camera perspective, but in 3D with quite some depth. It is not based on a certain movie or comic, but on the franchise as a whole with a new story. The animations and sequences are rather quirky and share nothing with the darker atmosphere of the contemporary Batman movies. A cast of villains has escaped from Arkham Asylum and now roam through Gotham City wreaking havoc. The first half of the game, players control Batman and his sidekick Robin to take on all enemies with typical brawler gameplay. Enemies will often respawn endlessly until the player figures out how to progress. The environments can be explored using a number of gadgets such as the batarang and the grappling hook, and players can switch between the two characters at any time. They can both fight and the inactive character is always controlled by the computer AI. Both characters have unique powers they can access by changing their suits. Batman can then glide through the air or plant bombs, while Robin has for instance a technology suit that allows his to walk on metal surfaces in any direction. They can also drive certain vehicles. Both characters operate out of the Batcave that acts as a central hub to store trophies and access missions. Many of the missions have small puzzle elements with buttons or passages that need to be cleared. Objects and characters explode into smaller LEGO blocks and at certain sections the hero need to build structures with blocks to create new objects. After completing a mission in the story mode, it becomes available in a separate free play mode. In the second part of the game players take control of the different villains such as Poison Ivy, The Joker, Mr Freeze, The Riddler, Killer Moth, Hush, Clayface, Man-Bat and more. They all have different powers and their section of the game always ends at the moment they are confronted by Batman and Robin. This way, the game shows how they set up their plans prior to the fights in the first part of the game. The characters collect coins, objects and hearts. Even though they can die, they immediately respawn. Multi player options vary between platforms. Home console and Windows versions allow drop in/drop out co-op. The PSP release fares worst of all and does not contain any kind of multiplayer option.</story>

    <story>In LEGO Indiana Jones- The Original Adventures the players get to explore the Indiana Jones universe with LEGO-fied characters. The game focuses on the three original films- Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, each film consisting of six separate chapters retelling the stories in a humorous, light-hearted way that tones down the violence while removing some of the more overt religious and political references found in the film. All of the sets and props are also made out of LEGOs, and retain their properties such as the ability to be rebuilt and fall apart. In this third-person platform/action game, players take control over various heroes including Indiana Jones, Marion Ravenwood or Dr. Marcus Brody, and also allows players to play the villains such as Belloq and Mola Ram. Each character has different abilities and weapons. While Indiana Jones has a whip with which he can pull items out of reach, the female characters can jump higher, scholars can decipher hieroglyphics, mechanics can fix machines and diggers can unearth buried treasure. The characters also have different phobias (snakes, rats, spiders), each corresponding to their personalities. The main campaign of the game is called Story Mode in which the player follows the film&apos;s stories with two pre-defined characters and cut-scenes. Once the level has been cleared, however, the player can return in Free Play mode and switch between all the characters that have been unlocked, allowing access to previously unreachable areas to collect all other artifacts and bonus items. Destroying or building objects produces Lego studs, which allows the player to buy additional characters and cheat modes in Barnett College (the main hub). Players can also watch previous cut-scenes, examine previously found treasures, enter codes, or explore the college at their leisure. As in the LEGO Star Wars series, in addition to the single-player game, there is also a 2 player co-op mode that allows two players to play the Story Mode. The second player can enter the game at any given time by pressing a button on the second controller.</story>

    <story>The Legos strike back in the sequel to the original LEGO Star Wars- The Video Game, where players now get to explore the original trilogy of the Star Wars universe. LEGO Star Wars II is a game where players use LEGO-ized Star Wars characters to reenact all three of the original movies. All of the sets and props are also made out of LEGO&apos;s, and retain their properties such as the ability to be rebuilt and fall apart. LEGO Star Wars puts an original spin on the series by adding a light-hearted, humorous touch to the movies, and also by using no dialogue. In this third-person platforming/action game, players take control of the characters and vehicles of Star Wars. In Story Mode, players reenact the original movies with LEGOs. Each character has different weapons, like light-sabers for Jedi&apos;s, and crossbows for Wookies, as well as new character-specific attacks and maneuvers. Each character also has different abilities, like Jedi&apos;s being able to use the force, R2-D2 being able to unlock doors, or Boba Fett being able to use his jet pack. It is up to the player to use these abilities to solve puzzles and traverse the levels of the game. In addition to a single-player game, there is also a 2 player co-op mode that allows two players to play the Story Mode. In addition, there is also a Free-play mode that allows you to go back and play your beaten levels. For one, this allows you to go back and play the level with any character in the game that you have unlocked. However, a newly added feature allows you to create your own mixed up LEGO characters, and also allows you to create your own vehicles out of LEGO&apos;s. Power Brock items and coin stubs collected in Story Mode will also unlock new characters, vehicles, and items for you to play with.</story>

Additional features (such as designing the club kits and logo) are unlocked as the player advances. At the start of the game, the player learns the backstory of the club - established 15 years ago, it quickly rose through the amateur divisions, but at an enormous expense - it&apos;s the end of the season, and to reach the second division the team has made a huge effort signing players, and while they&apos;re in the promotion playoffs, the club is broke, and the only way to survive is to reach the second division. To make things worse, a local tycoon is eyeing a club to buy, and the nearly bankrupt club might be the easiest target... While the presentation is a lot different from other managers (excluding, perhaps, the ZOO Digital rehash of Premier Manager) due to the extensive use of 3D characters and models in the menus, as well as featuring some story elements, it features the same options as other managers in the market, featuring player and staff signing, team tactics and training, but also financial decisions like sponsoring and stadium and facility improvement.</story>

    <story>The year is 2029. The date is Christmas Eve. At the grand opening of the Japan Space Station Hotel, a horde of creatures bursts into the hotel and they start killing everyone. You manage to escape, but you are trapped inside a security room with no chance of getting out. Your only hope lies in Rio, a lone woman, whom you guide by talking to her. Guide her well, and she may be able to rescue you. Rely on her, for she is your one and only life line. Lifeline is the first game on the PlayStation 2 that is entirely voice controlled. You do not directly control Rio. Instead, you speak to her and tell her what to do. If you want her to open the bathroom door, tell her to open the bathroom door. If there is a keycard laying on the table, tell her to pick it up. If a monster is closing in that she can&apos;t shoot, tell her to run away. You explore the entire Space Station Hotel, from the kitchen to maintenance to bedrooms to bathrooms, finding items and encountering a slew of different enemies. Lifeline recognizes over two thousand words and phrases, basically giving you the freedom to tell her anything you want, and she will understand. Commands generally consists of a noun and a verb, but many of those can be combined into a single command (e.g. reload, shoot, retreat). Rio can also be ordered to target specific parts of enemies to exploit their weaknesses and players can also change the attack order in a similar fashion. A headset is required to play the game, from a game bundle, a third-party headset, or any headset compatible with USB.</story>

    <story>This is a collection of mini-games based on the UK comedy sketch TV series Little Britain that ran between 2003 and 2006. The included games are based on some of the scenes and recurring characters. It also includes the original voices of the two leads and the narrator. Players need to unlock the different games by competing in a Tour with three difficulty levels. On Easy, for each 50,000 points another game is opened up and clips from the series are unlocked. The included games are set at different, fictitious locations in Britain and require a lot of button mashing- 1. Darkley Noone- Vicky Pollars needs to complete two laps on roller-skates in a skate park. She has to collect CDs to throw a party, while avoiding hazard, performing tricks when jumping in the air, and grinding on rails. 2. Herby- Lou and Andy go to the swimming pool, but as soon as they are there, Andy doesn&apos;t like it. While Lou explains to a guard how he wants his handicapped friend get to swim, Andy need to dive off diving boards and perform tricks. There are three boards to choose from and he needs to get back in his wheelchair before time runs out. 3. Sessex- Weight Watcher guide Marjorie runs around in a supermarket collecting cookies in a Pac-Man-style mini-game. The ghosts are represented by fatties she needs to avoid, but by picking up cake (similar to the original power pellets), she can take them out for a short time. 4. Slut- Letty has to squash all the frogs in her living room, making sure not to hit any other objects. Gameplay is similar to the Whac-A-Mole concept, except that the frogs jump around instead of popping up. 5. Old Haven- Emily, a real lady, needs to score a number of goals in a game of football (soccer) before time runs out. She needs to progress over the pitch step by step and avoid hitting the defenders as that returns her to the starting location. She does get points for shooting them in their private parts. The PSP version is slightly different as it is presented as a game of penalty kicks, without defenders. The direction and the force of the kick can be determined separately. 6. Pox- make matches of three identical items collecting food in Maggie&apos;s gullet as she gulps it down. Once it is full, she can spew out all the food over her friends at the party for extra points. 7. Llandewi Breffi- Dafydd Thomas is the only gay in the village and needs to prove it. He rides a bicycle through the streets and needs to collect copies of Gay Magazine while running down other people and slapping fake gays. The PSP version contains an additional game- 1. Flatley- help Eh Eh Eh Anne at the psychiatric institute to destroy the flowers in the garden. She can stamp them, pull them out, and then smash it or chuck it. She needs to avoid the men in white coats that chase after her. She can temporarily stun them by flashing them when she lifts her skirt. Next to the games in the Tour, there are also Challenges where a mini-game needs to be replayed with a specific goal, a movie gallery where the unlocked clips can be viewed, and a highscore list. Aside from graphical differences, gameplay is largely identical across the platforms. The PSP version includes wireless multiplayer for up to two players.</story>

Nitro tokens can also be collected and bought, and the cars&apos; colors can be changed. There are also two split-screen two player modes- Duel and Cop vs. Driver. In the Duel mode, players race against each other in any given track.

Aragorn can block, use quick or strong sword attacks and shoot arrows and charge his bow for more powerful attacks. He can also use a variety of special moves, many of which are acquired as the game progresses. Defeating foes replenishes some health, and gives experience points and morale. Aragorn&apos;s morale is depleted by using some special moves. As in most RPGs, gaining experience results in leveling-up, which improve Aragorn&apos;s stats and rewards the player with points to use to learn previously acquired special moves. Pieces of equipment such as swords and belts can be equipped to increase Aragorn&apos;s prowesses.</story>

A classic RPG game, The Lord of the Rings- The Third Age has gameplay elements similar to Final Fantasy, where you have a party of characters, each with a different set of skills and attributes, who gain levels, making them stronger as the game progresses. Battles are turn-based, and let the gamer make different decisions on what they want to do to change the outcome of the battle.

    <story>Electronic Arts&apos; first game based on the Lord of the Rings movies is an action game with classic beat&apos;em up-style gameplay. Despite the title, it covers events from both the first and the second film in the trilogy. Players, choosing to control Aragorn, Legolas or Gimli, must battle the evil forces of the Dark Lord Sauron in order to protect the Ring of Power and restore peace to Middle-earth. The player character moves through the levels, fighting hordes of Orcs, Goblins and other creatures with various attack and parrying moves. The more varied the attacks are and the less the player is hit, the more points are awarded for each kill. At the end of each level, kill points are accumulated and can be used to gain new abilities. Most of these are new attack moves, unleashed through various button combinations. Others increase health or upgrade the strength or speed of existing attacks. Each of the three characters has unique upgrades and moves. Several levels feature boss battles with the likes of the Watcher of Moria or Lurtz, leader of the Uruk-hai. Each boss requires a unique strategy to defeat. Most combat scenes from the movies have been turned into levels for the game- from the confrontation with the Ringwraiths at the Weathertop and the battle in the Mines of Moria from the first film to fights with Warg-riders and other enemies on the plains of Rohan from the second film. The game culminates in the defense of Helm&apos;s Deep, even though the depiction of the battle in the game differs considerably from that in the film. Between the levels, cutscenes tell the story. These scenes combine actual film footage with footage rendered with the game engine. The game offers lots of bonus content, some of which must be unlocked by completing missions or reaching certain levels with the characters. Featured are interviews with the filmmakers and actors (who also provide voices for the game) as well as various making-of features.</story>

Other features can also be found in other versions of the game- a fight for the fumble mini-game, hot and cold streaks for players during a game, and newly-recorded commentary from Cris Collinsworth and Tom Hammond.</story>

He (Joey) then goes on to tell his story, whereupon the first level begins- he begins his life of crime in North Carolina, where a delivery goes awry. The game is played from a third-person perspective, much like Max Payne, with character movement controlled by the W, A, S, and D keys. The mouse is used to aim and shoot, as well as for limited camera movement. You can take cover behind objects by pressing space. This makes Joey press his back against said object (i.e. a wall, a trash bin, etc.) and you can then shoot from behind it. Additionally, a slow mode, dubbed kill rush is available for use, but only after you fill up a kill meter.</story>

    <story>In Mafia, you play as Tommy Angelo, a cabbie in the 1930&apos;s prohibition America, who is suddenly thrust into the mafia. The game begins with a cutscene. All of a sudden, two guys jump into your cab, and tell you to lose the people behind you, who seem to be shooting at you. After going through the city, and finally losing the tail, you are instructed to drive to a bar. The two guy&apos;s get out, go inside, and bring out a nice payment for you, and offer you a job. The next day, while taking a coffee break, your car is smashed by two rival gangsters. After this, you decide it would be wise to join the two guy&apos;s you picked up last night, and this is where the game begins. You are now a soldier in the Salieri family. You begin the game as a lowly soldier, doing routine jobs. The more you do, the better you do, the better (and more dangerous) jobs will become available to you. There are many people you will encounter throughout the game, such as Sam and Paulie, your partners, Frank, the accountant, Luigi, the bartender, Ralph, the mechanic, Vincenzo, the weapons guy, and Lucas Bertone, the out of family mechanic. You will have the chance to drive over 60 vehicles that are reminiscent of the 1930&apos;s period. Each car handles differently, with various degrees of damage. You can smash windows, destroy bumpers, lights, and mirrors, dent the car, shoot out the tires, or shoot the tires so much they just fall off. With these vehicles, you will drive through twelve square miles of the city, visiting areas such as Central Island, Chinatown, and the Downtown district. Complementing the vehicles is a wide array of weapons, such as pistols, tommy guns, shotguns, explosives, baseball bats and crowbars. While driving a car, you can perform drive-by&apos;s by sticking your hand out the window and firing. To add to the realism, if your gas tank gets punctured, gas will slowly leak out until your car totally empties. Luckily, there are gas stations scattered throughout the city, allowing you to refuel. Trying to impede you is the police force. They will act on anything suspicious. If they see you carrying a weapon, they will attempt to arrest you. Going over the speed limit, running red lights, crashing into buildings/cars/objects/etc. will result in fines.</story>

One day, the protagonist of the game finds such a Pengel and tries to create a Doodle. The first experiments do not go very well, and the protagonist realizes he requires the help of a young girl named Zoe and her brother Taro. Their father, Galileo, was one of the finest Doodlers (painters who use Pengels) in the land. But he had to flee as he refused to work for the corrupt king, who uses the art of Doodlers for his evil purposes. Zoe, Taro, and the hero must participate in a battle tournament and find a way to bring Galileo back and defeat the king. Magic Pengel- The Quest for Color is a combination of monster-breeding, collecting role-playing game in a Pokémon style, and a drawing game similar to Mario Paint.

    <story>Major League Baseball 2K9 is a simulation of the sport of baseball. The heart of the game is the franchise mode where the player can play whole seasons with its hundreds of matches and a managerial part. Besides keeping the balance, there are three main activities in this part- studying extensive statistics, player trading and hiring players through free agents. The latter is similar to other sports games- every player has other wishes for his team, e.g. athletic success. If the player&apos;s club can fulfill these wishes better the club has to pay less salary. Trading however is handled differently- Every club gives a value to the players on the roster. This value influences how the trading plays out. Training is another important part to consider. Matches can either be simulated or played manually. Every part of the match has its own control scheme- For pitching the player uses two parts of his input device- the first for aiming and the second to recreate a movement (depending on the used move). Batting is done by swinging the bat in the right timing. He can also influence the ball&apos;s direction in the way he hits it. During fielding the player basically tells the controlled player the direction in which he should throw the ball. Besides the franchise mode the player can participate in training, Home Run Derby and Postseason mode (play-offs). Players can unlock training cards. The are a few small differences between the versions- on the Wii the player controls batting and pitching directly with the remote and the nunchuck and the PSP version features slightly different fielding controls. In the franchise mode the player can manage up to four franchises in the PS2 version and there is a farming system on PSP.</story>

    <story>Makai Kingdom is the fourth Nippon Ichi-developed tactical RPG on PlayStation 2 and it follows closely in the footsteps of the previous games of the same style, which are Disgaea- Hour of Darkness, La Pucelle- Tactics and Phantom Brave. Lord Zetta, the king of Netherworld, tried to rewrite the history of the land but didn&apos;t succeed, and in the process brought demise onto himself. Three evil Overlords appeared before Zetta and promised to help him in his quest to take over the land once more. The player takes control of Zetta and his army to return Netherworld to its rightful owner. The game mechanics consist of several stages in which the player must defeat the enemy or fulfill other tasks to advance to the next level. Fighting is done in turns, meaning that once the player has moved and attacked, it&apos;s the enemy&apos;s turn to move his troops one by one. When the battle is won, the next level becomes selectable. Between fights, you can improve your squad of fighters by buying better weapons, recruiting more soldiers and so on.</story>

The game still features RPG-style elements, but now with different features. Instead of leveling up by defeating enemies where the player can choose how there character will develop using a crafting system, letting them choose which attributes they want to modify. Players can also craft items and weapons using various objects scattered throughout the world.

    <story>Manhunt casts you as James Earl Cash, a prisoner on death row. You are led down a corridor where you are about to receive a lethal injection. The needle goes in. You wake up hours later. A mysterious voice tells you to stick in the nearby earpiece, and explains that the lethal injection was just a heavy sedative. The man, later identified as Starkweather, turns out to be a director of snuff movies, where the people are really killed. He explains that if you follow his directions, manage to kill people and survive, you&apos;ll earn your freedom. This begins James Earl Cash&apos;s journey. Throughout the course of the game, you&apos;ll have to make your way through different locales, such as a city and a mall, while killing gangs. You&apos;ll face lots of different gangs, from The Hoods and The Skins to tougher gangs like The Innocenz. Gang members carry weapons ranging from pistols and shotguns to knives and glass shards. Manhunt is primarily a stealth game. You&apos;ll have to hide behind walls, flatten yourself against walls, crouch, hide behind objects, and walk to avoid attracting attention. You can also throw glass bottles to create a distraction, or you can punch surfaces and yell to get gangs to come to you. You have a variety of weapons at your disposal, from the traditional, such as the shotgun and uzi, to the disgusting, such as a sickle and plastic bag. Each weapon has three different ways of attacking, depending on how long you hold the button. A quick attack will do the job, a medium attack will be bloody, but a high attack, requiring the longest amount of time, will earn you the most points, and will allow you to see your kill in a cinematic style, with blood splatting on the camera, and gurgling noises. Manhunt also lets you use a USB headset, such as the one that came included with SOCOM- U.S. Navy Seals. With the headset, you will hear Starkweather speak into your ears instead of through your speakers, and you will be able to shout into the microphone to attract gangs instead of pressing a button.</story>

    <story>Manhunt 2 does not build upon the story and events of the first game. Instead, the same game mechanics are transferred to a new location, the Dixmor Insane Asylum, where the staff prefers to beat up the patients and experiment on them, rather than to offer treatment for their illness. One day a power outage allows the patients to revolt and bring mayhem to the asylum. The player gets the chance to play two roles- as Dr. Daniel Lamb and Leo Kasper. Although the beginning is set inside the asylum, the action soon moves to other locations. The game mechanics are largely stealth oriented, while later levels offer more of a regular third-person shooter feel when more firearms become available. Gunplay requires extensive use of cover, maneuvers and sometimes stealth for success. There is a radar system, enemies have different levels of awareness and kills are best performed from the shadows. Players can throw objects to distract enemies or make noises into the USB headset to lure them away from their friends (PS2). To hide in the dark a quick mini-game needs to be performed. If it is not completed in time, the character&apos;s location will be revealed at once. As in the first game players can perform executions, with three styles- Hasty (white), Violent (yellow) and Gruesome (red). These feature explicit violence including strangling, beatings, gun violence, setting them on fire and more. Some of these kills are however censored with blacked out scenes or the camera turning away. In the Wii version player need to mimic the motions needed for a kill with the combination of the Wiimote and the Nunchuk. All versions are quite similar. The Wii edition includes three exclusive weapons (bottle, mace and a razor), while the other two versions have a weapon not found in the Wii game- a samurai sword. The Wii version is also the only one to include a short tutorial to familiarize the player with the controls. Other small changes in the Wii edition include more detailed environments, additional dialogue, new hunters (Sexual Deviants scene), some changes in weapon placement, a new manhole execution (in Ghosts), and more animations for Daniel and Leo, especially in close combat.</story>

    <story>Contents Under Pressure is an action adventure that combines stealth and combat, as you guide urban graffiti artist Trane to fame. In the oppressed city of New Radius, you need to establish your name as an artist by laying down tags, burners and full pieces, but rival crews and law enforcement (Civil Conduct Keepers) are always on your tail. You will also uncover a conspiracy that plagues the city. The game is story-driven with linear level progression. Most missions have platform elements and require you to lay art, varying from tags and stickers to complex pieces with full color, lettering and characters, on often difficult to reach surfaces. As it is not a friendly environment, Trane can deliver a host of punch and kick combos, use grabs, humiliate other artists, and interact with the surroundings. Your art arsenal includes markers, brushes, cans and rollers. All available pieces are kept in your black book, and new styles are unlocked while playing. The title refers to working your way up the scene, as well as the Get In, Get Up, and Get Out principle - you need to gain access to restricted areas, get up on tall objects where your work can be seen, and get out afterwards without being caught. Good spots can be tracked using Intuition, and appear as coloured clouds. The game is conceived by clothing impresario Marc Ecko, founder of the suburban designer label Ecko and is intended to pay tribute to graffiti culture and its history. Artists such as Cope2, Futura and Seen contributed art to the game.</story>

The games are as follows- •Word Link- The player is presented with a grid of letters and has 90 seconds to find as many three, four, five and six letter words as possible from connected letters. As words are created the letters are removed from the grid and others fall down in their place. •Word Mine- The player is presented with six jumbled up letters and has to make as many words out of those as possible. •Hyper Txt- The player is presented with words that has to be spelled with a mobile phone pad as fast as possible. •Word Run- The player competes against an AI opponent and has to place as many words as possible on a 6x6 grid. It&apos;s similar to Scrabble but the player can use any letters and the words does not have to be connected. •Word Safe- Similar to Word Link but here the letters make out two wheels that can be rotated to enable more word connections. •Word Search- The player is briefly shown three six letter words and then has 20 seconds to find them on a 6x6 grid </story>

    <story>Dr. Doom has united supervillains as the Masters of Evil. Now for the first time ever, over 20 Marvel superheroes including Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Ghost Rider, Blade and Silver Surfer have come together to stop Doom. Mix and match your choice of Marvel superheroes, in teams of four as you travel across the Marvel Universe to stop this threat. Certain teams such as The Fantastic Four and The New Avengers provide additional bonuses. Some heroes must be unlocked first. The game also features RPG elements, such as leveling up. When a hero gains a level, they earn points you can use to upgrade their skills. You also collect Shield Coins, which can be spent on boosts for your hero team. You explore various legendary Marvel locales, from Asgard, to Prince Namor&apos;s Atlantis, where you take on foes with punches, kicks and super powers. Super powers drain energy, however, so use them wisely. Combos can be achieved by combining super powers. Energy is restored by collecting blue orbs from fallen foes. Boss battles are like the comics themselves- titanic battles that often not only test brawn but your brain as well. With over 20 playable heroes plus all the cameos, there are over 100 heroes and villains. The game modes feature either single player, co-op, or online play. In general, Marvel Ultimate Alliance&apos;s gameplay can be considered an improved version of 2004&apos;s X-Men- Legends. The different versions are fairly identical. The PSP release has three more game modes, while Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 have additional levels.</story>

    <story>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 continues the four-player mayhem of the previous Marvel Ultimate Alliance and, before that, the X-Men Legends series It is based on the Secret War and Civil War storylines from the comics. After Nick Fury leads an unauthorized super-hero assault on Latveria and a fight gone wrong kills hundreds of civilians in Connecticut, the government passes the super-human registration act, which requires all super-powered individuals to reveal their identities to the government. At one point in the story, you have to choose the pro or anti registration side and certain heroes will always be on one side or another, locking them out if you choose the other path. The game after this point changes depending on the storyline you choose. You start with a handful of characters and can unlock more by completing bonus simulator missions, which will give you a special task like blowing up cars. There are four heroes active at all times during the game, unless they get knocked out. Each character has a health meter and a stamina meter. You can use SHIELD access points, usually at the beginning and middle of each level, to switch out characters. The stamina meter recharges on its own and controls use of powers. Each hero has a jump (which can also be used to double-jump, fly or web-swing, depending on the character), grab, quick strike and powerful strike. These can be used in combination to do things like jumping attacks, pick up an enemy, then punch them, etc. Combining these with a modifier button allows you to use powers. Each hero has a wide variety of powers. Leveling up gives you points to spend on improving the powers. You can re-assign the points and change which powers are active at any time. Defeating enemies and smashing environment items gives you health refills and points that can be spent upgrading statistics for each hero. There are also items that you can carry that will give stat bonuses like increased HP or a bonus to a specific type of damage. The big change over the previous game is the addition of fusions, which are two-character team-up attacks. This is controlled by a meter of four stars. You fill this by defeating enemies or finding an item that instantly fills the whole meter. You can spend one star to revive a fallen teammate or all four to perform a fusion attack. Any possible combination of two characters has their own unique fusion. There are three basic types- There are targeted fusions, like having Things throw Mr. Fantastic at someone. These do high damage to a single target and are good for using on bosses. There are also clearing fusions, like having Storm bounce her lighting off Wolverine. These damage all enemies in a given radius. Clearing fusions are good for clearing out a clump of enemies. Finally, there are guided fusions, like Iceman and Human Torch shooting their powers at each other, then running around mowing down anyone who gets between them. These are good for clearing out scattered enemies.</story>

    <story>Mashed is an action-packed top-down arcade-racer. On 13 tracks (which must be played free in single-player first) you need all your driving skills to survive and make it to the finish as the 1st with one of the four different cars available (from slow ones to really fast ones). The heart of the single-player mode (besides the quick battle against the AI) are the bronze, silver and gold challenges for every track you need to complete to play free the next track. Each challenge is one of the seven (eight in multiplayer) game modes available in Mashed. From normal race-events (just be the 1st) over battles where you need to kill all your enemies before they do to the ultimate survival mode where everyone doesn&apos;t really like you. To make things much easier there are nine different power-ups and weapons scattered on the tracks which you can pick up. From simple oil slicks over mines to deadly mortars there&apos;s everything you need to kick the enemy drivers out of the race. Of course they can also choose from the equipment. As you can only survive a few hits you need to make sure they can&apos;t use them on you. And to make it even worse there are many small passages (or the track is just one small passage...) with nothing on one or both sides of the track in which you or your enemy can fall very deep. But the real heart of Mashed is the split-screen multiplayer mode which you can play with up to four players on one PC. If you don&apos;t find four friends you can fill in the missing spots with bots or just leave them open. The additional eighth, multiplayer exclusive game mode is like CTF with cars. The goal is to hold the flag and drive as far away from the enemies as possible to get a point. To keep the race interesting for the players that are already out of it, they can use a helicopter which flies over the track to launch missile attacks on the cars still racing. So you can take your revenge before the race is even over and the racers have one more thing to worry about. But this feature can be deactivated when you setup the race.</story>

    <story>Mat The Condor Hoffman and nine other world-class Pro BMX riders feature in this entry to the BMX racing series. Many gameplay features remain as before. PS2/XB/NGC description With the use of DVD technology, actual video footage of Mat and the crew was taken from their recent road trip and put into the game to give you a feeling of actually being there with them. Flatland tricks are another new addition. Also, there is the ability to tweak almost any stunt. Single Player Modes- Session - Take some extra time to practice your tricks and routines in 2, 5, or 10 minute sessions on any of the levels that are unlocked. Scores can be saved to be put into the Hall of Fame. Free Ride - Like Session, you can use this time to practice your skills but with unlimited time. Any score you get for a trick is replaced by the points of the next trick. Since this is the case, no scores can be saved. Road Trip - This is where you take the trip with the guys to go around and compete around the country. Withine each level there are goals to reach to improve your skills, unlock new levels, unlock bikes, and secrets in the game. Multiplayer Modes- Trick Attack - Compete against each other in a split screen competion to get the highest score you can in a certaon amount of time. Free Ride - Ride around showing off your stuff to your opponent. Graffiti War - Ride around and find the Spray Cans in the level, once you find them, perform a trick on the terrain. Once a stunt is completed your oppenent&apos;s screen will be painted. The opponent can perform a higher scoring trick to clear the paint. Tag - The person that is it is the only one that can score points. Be the first to find the red ring to be it. While you&apos;re it score as many points as you can. The person not it must track the other down and knock into them to be it. If the person that is it bails then the other person will become it. H.O.R.S.E. - Just like the old game of HORSE for basketball. In this case you need to perform a higher scoring run to beat them for the letter. The one with the lower score with be given a letter. The first person to spell HORSE is the loser. Treasure Hunt - Race against each other to find the Golden Condor. Getting the Condor is the only way to score points. Half Pipe Hell - Up to 8 players can play HotSeat style. You must take turns tricking your way up a mountain of terraced half pipes. The only way to score is to climb to the top by transferring pipe to pipe. Push - This is like Trick Attack, but as you score more and more points your opponent&apos;s screen will get smaller and smaller. The loser is the one that gets push all the way off the screen. The Pros in the game include Mat Hoffman, Joe Kowalski, Rick Thorne, Mike Escamilla, Simon Tabron, Kevin Robinson, Cory Nastazio, Ruben Alcantara, Seth Kimbrough, and Nate Wessel. The locations you get to go to are Oklahoma City, Chicago, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Boston, Los Angeles, Portland, and Hawaii. To enhance the game, there is also a park editor so that you can make your own dream areas to ride in. </story>

This time you get to play as Neo himself, starting from the day agents came to take him from his office, through the race against the clock with the machines digging towards Zion, to the final battle against Agent Smith. Like in the movies you&apos;ll start out as the untrained Thomas Anderson, and with the training and events of the movie your skills grow, enabling you to do complicated combos and take down upgraded agents. Although the game follows the events of the trilogy, there are some missions that come as an in-depth look of events only spoken briefly in the films.</story>

    <story>Max Payne has nothing to lose. His wife and son are gone, killed by Valkyr junkies. His DEA partner Alex is gone, killed by forces unknown, and Max is blamed for Alex&apos;s death. The mob is out to get him. The police are out to get him. The only way out is with guns blazing... Max Payne is a 3rd person action shooter with a twist... Instead of just running around and shoot like Lara Croft, Max has a trick called Bullet-Time (tm). First seen in The Matrix movie, Bullet-Time slows the action WAY DOWN so you can shoot the bad guys full of holes before they take three steps... But your amount of bullet time is limited. Perform rolls and leaps like those you see in action movies and perform bullet-time runs or shot-dodging. Take on all comers armed anywhere from baseball bats to Ingram sub-machine guns, even grenades and Molotov cocktails. Salvage ammo, weapons, and painkillers from this hellhole version of New York to keep your fighting edge. See plot develop in graphic novel-style panels. Will Max Payne see his revenge?</story>

    <story>I lied to myself that it was over. I was still alive, my loved ones were still dead. It wasn&apos;t over. Released from prison through his contacts in higher orbs, Max Payne is back on the NYPD as a hero; but he is living a life of misery, tormented by the memories of his murdered family. One day, investigating a routine case, Max runs into Mona Sax. The mysterious and seductive paid assassin who joined Max in his revenge against Nicole Horne tells him that both of them are in great danger. Now Max needs to run against the clock, to solve the case which seems to be all about his murder. His only ally is a woman who&apos;s wanted by his own police dept. Max Payne 2, the follow-up to the styled third-person action shooter, brings back the noir detective atmosphere, the stunning John-Woo-style action sequences, and the few survivors from the first game- Mona Sax is back, Vladimir Lev is back, Vinnie Gognitti is back, Jim Bravura is back, Alfred Woden is back, and the mysterious Inner Circle is working again. Someone wants Max dead. Who? Why? Max Payne 2 is built on the same engine as the first game, but it&apos;s been loaded up with all the special effects of next generation games. Dynamic shadows and lighting effects, cubic mapped reflections, and high resolution textures make the game look incredibly real. The &amp;quot;Havok&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Ragdoll&amp;quot; physics engines take care of objects and characters respectively, creating an incredibly realistic and interactive game world. Gameplay has been also enhanced, there are even more weapons, we can use two different weapons at the same time, there are NPCs who will join sides with us, and the much-acclaimed &amp;quot;Bullet Time&amp;quot; feature has been upgraded to version 2.0, in which Max&apos;s speed in &amp;quot;bullet time&amp;quot; increases as he gets more kills. The game also offers several unlockable difficulty and gameplay modes, once finished.</story>

Unlike most RPGs the storyline is very similar to the traditional side-scrolling Mega Man games. In addition, the game is shorter than most RPGs. The basic plot of the game is to save Giga City from the rioting of the Liberion Army. As the game progresses you have around 7 members. With a metal called Force Metal, your characters can upgrade various elements. The Gamecube version let&apos;s you link up to Game Boy Advance so you can use the GBA as a treasure hunter locater.

    <story>Mega Man returns in yet another Mega Man X game. This time the camera is vastly improved and there is a good mix of 2D and 3D action. Unlike X7 the game is mostly 2D. Returning to the series is an rpg-like upgrade system. Axl and Zero have also return, however Axl cannot run and shoot anymore. The loading times are vastly improved. The game has a quicker pace and multiple endings. However keep in mind that there are occasional slowdowns.</story>

Each faction will offer the player resources such as vehicles and supplies, as well as missions that the player can use to make money off of. If the player makes a faction happy, they will offer intel on the locations of various bounties from the deck. You have a vast array of resources available to you to get the job done. Commandeer tanks, choppers and and any other military hardware to blow up the game&apos;s miles of destructible landscape across the North Korean countryside.

    <story>Mercenaries 2- World in Flames is the sequel to Mercenaries. Rather than a port, compared to the next-gen versions this title was reworked to a large extent by Pi Studios with fundamental differences in approach. It is set in the country of Venezuela, with a new set of enemies and allies. The game begins with the player choosing one of three mercenaries from the original game, (Mattias Nilsson, Chris Jacobs and Jennifer Mui), and is contracted by a Venezuelan billionaire, Ramon Solano, to rescue a general named Carlos Carmona who attempted a coup d’état and failed. Once the player succeeds, Solano and Carmona refuse to pay and try to kill the mercenary. Afterwards, Carmona and Solano take over Venezuela, pulling of a successful coup, seizing the countries oil platforms, putting the world on alert as they seize total control of the country. Unbeknown to them, the players mercenary has survived and is now plotting revenge on the pair. The player must take contracts from rival factions such as Universal Petroleum, an oil company who&apos;s business is threatened by Solano, the P.L.A.V. (People’s Liberation Army of Venezuela), who are a force of rebel soldiers determined to take back their country, The Jamaican Pirates, who profit from Solano&apos;s forces, The A.N. (Allied Nations), who have entered the company to try and bring back stability to the region and The Chinese Army, who hope to take control of Venezuela as well, marking themselves as a true superpower. The gameplay is basically the same as the previous version, with the control scheme virtually the same, but there are some tweaks as well. One of which is a new way to hijack a vehicle. Whereas in the previous game the player could simply walk up to the vehicle and automatically hijack, now they must kill the gunner of the vehicle and then enter a mini-game, pressing a certain button or rotating the analog stick in a certain way to successfully hijack the vehicle. Likewise, players can also you a grappling hook to latch on to passing helicopters to make it easier to hijack. Players can now swim, whereas the previous game the player would die the instant they hit the water. Players now have a headquarters of sort, where the player can stockpile weapons, supply crates and vehicles. To obtain these stockpiles the player must recruit three certain soldiers unlockable in the game. A helicopter pilot named Ewan Garrett, who delivers stockpile crates as well as medivacs the player, a mechanic named Eva Navarro, who will repair and stock vehicles when you return them to the villa and is used for artillery strikes and a fighter pilot named Misha Milanich, who is used for air strikes. Players can use these during a mission by calling in Ewan to deliver their supplies via helicopter during a mission. Also Fiona Taylor reprises her role, giving the player technical information during the missions. There is no more black market contacts to purchase supplies or airstrikes, instead players must take complete jobs for contacts scattered on the island, completing jobs for these contacts will supply the player&apos;s headquarters with materials such as weapons, medikits, and artillery support. Players can also stockpile vehicles by driving back to their headquarters, keeping them at the garage for use in missions. Also, players must have gas as well now to bring in supplies or call in airstrikes, which can be obtained by either completing contracts or collecting them scattered throughout the country.</story>

    <story>Mercury Meltdown is the sequel to Archer Maclean&apos;s Mercury, a puzzle game where your job is to guide a blob of mercury, or several blobs, along various mazes, by tilting the game world, while hazard try to zap, attract, repulse, eat, or blow you up. Mercury Meltdown features a new vibrant visual style, a lot of completely new stages, a free-look camera, ghost mercuries and replays for your best times that can be saved, and much more. The game&apos;s original realistic graphics have been turned into a more cartoon style. The mercury now has a black line around the outside of it. The main change in the game is the ability to change the mercury into 3 more states. Besides normal state now you can turn the mercury into the Fast or Slow using a heater and a cooler, and using a solidifier you can make it unto Solid state, a round, non-breakable ball. The mercury can still be split using a splitter, needed to solve certain puzzles. Unlike the original Mercury, the game is split into themed Labs rather than “Worlds”. There are 10 Labs, with 16 initial stages- Astro, Bio, Chemical, Electro, Geo, Atom, Aero, Hydro, Micro, V.R. (Virtual Reality). The PS2 version adds two more- Chrono and Cryo, as well as twin analog control, support for the rumble feature, improved graphics and all the levels from the original Archer Maclean&apos;s Mercury. There are 168 stages in the PSP version and over 200 in the PS2 game. Unlike the previous game, there is no strict order to play the levels. Once a Lab has been unlocked, you can play all the stages included right away. Attributes show how well you do in the games. The best performance is awarded with a golden cork, based on four conditions- a high score (a 1 sticker), all bonus items found (a star sticker), 100% mercury (a corked test-tube), and complete the level within the time limit. While playing, your progress is measured in faces that replace the time clock. The time limit cannot cause the game to end anymore, instead it just turns into a sad face and players can still complete the level. The mercury limits have also been removed, but 100% mercury is still needed to access some of the later stages. The top right corner shows a color chart, to help with mixing colors in the game. This can also be done in the paintshop. This release adds multi-paintshops, triangle base pyramid shaped constructions with 3 different coloured gates on either side. In addition to the main game, there are now five party games, which are unlocked by collecting the bonus stars in the main game- 1. Metrix- puzzle games where coloured blocks need to be fit inside a pre-defined grid. 2. Paint- move the mercury to paint the tray as much as possible against your opponent. 3. Race- guide mercury around speedy track with boost pads and avoid falling off. 4. Rodeo- tilt the playing area to keep the mercury on the field, while a fan tries to knock you off. 2. Shove- aim the mercury for the center spot of the target, just like curling. All the party games can be played in multiplayer over Wi-Fi on the PSP. The tutorial is now separate from the main game, and there is an additional Playground mode where you can test the different items in the game.</story>

    <story>Solid Snake is back! Blueprints of the original Metal Gear have leaked out onto the black market. Metal Gear Ray is developed to combat these new Metal Gears. During transport Metal Gear Ray is captured, but others have their own intentions... In the sequel, you once again resume the role of Solid Snake. You start the game in the rain, with a tranquilizer gun, which put the guards to sleep (instantly if you perform a successful headshot). There are a host of weapons to be picked up through out the game, some old, such as the FAMAS and Socom, and some new, such as the AK-47. Snake can perform all his old moves, as well as some new ones. Martial arts combos can be used to disable guards. He can crawl through small spaces, peek around corners and perform acrobatic leaps to get away. Snake can also hang from railings, effectively hiding from guards. He can also stick his gun in a guards back, surprising him. The cardboard box is also back, and can once again be used for hiding. Snake has his usual array of gadgets, his sneak suit and others can be found along the way, a mine detector, thermal goggles. The radar from the original game is still there and alerts you to guards positions and also shows you their field of view. As in the original though, if an alarm is sounded the radar is disabled while you escape. In some situations you will need to enable the radar before you can use it. The codec is also back. It is once again integral to the story, and even comes on sometimes in the heat of battle. If you get stuck in the game, it provides hints on what to do. Repeated calls yield more intuitive help on what to do. The guards in the game are a lot more wary in the sequel. If you get spotted by a guard, he will call for re-inforcements. You have a few seconds before he does this so you can shoot out his radio and disable him. However, other guards check why their buddy hasn&apos;t reported in and will come looking for him. All the cutscenes in the game use the in-game 3D engine, seamlessly blending action and story. All the characters movements are motion captured animations. All locations feature interactive environments, such as, shooting a bottle which will shatter into fragments or ice that actually melts if you stick around to watch it! The music in the game changes with the action, if you get into heated battle, the music becomes frantic, and slows down once the battle is over. Some sequences in the game even support Dolby 5.1.</story>

    <story>Snake is back... but this time literally back in time. Not a sequel to MGS2, but a new game with a setting before all the other Metal Gear games thus far. The time of Cold War, 1960&apos;s. But, how is Snake still Snake back in time, not looking any younger. Well in fact, he is looking younger, as you no longer play The Solid Snake, and if you ever wondered who was the renowned super-soldier that Liquid, Solid, and Solidus were all clones of, you&apos;ll meet him in battle for survival in this 3D action-adventure game. The survival of the fittest still works, but this time it&apos;s not only about dodging enemy bullets and staying out of sight. You have to think of your stamina, and as it goes along with survival, you gotta eat sometimes. And to help you blend with the environment, Snake is wearing a large stash of camouflaged uniforms. So, the Cold War, a situation created after the Second World War when the world was torn between East and West, is about to heat up as Soviets got their top scientist, Nikolai Stepanovich Sokolov, back due to agreement with the US government for withdrawing the nuclear missiles from Cuba. Now, with Sokolov in their hands, they&apos;re up to developing a nightmarish new weapon, and upon realizing the urgency of the situation, CIA formed a plan to recapture Sokolov, and they dispatch the covert FOX unit to Sokolov&apos;s research facility, located to the south of the great Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero, FOX is a next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX unit&apos;s modus operandi is to send a single agent, backed by radio support from afar, into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking mission. August 24, 1964, a lone soldier swoops down from out of the blue. The man&apos;s code name is Naked Snake... and things are about to escalate. It&apos;s a one-man war now, and the future of the world may now rests entirely on his shoulders now.</story>

    <story>The final game in the trilogy of Solid Snake&apos;s origins, MGS3- Subsistence delves deeper into the story behind MGS3- Snake Eater. Packing almost 3 times as many features as the original MGS3, Subsistence adds more depth and persona to the original MGS3 by adding more tweaks and content to the gameplay. In MGS3- Snake Eater is set in Cold War Russia, as tensions are rising between America and the USSR. Naked Snake, a highly trained stealth operative from the US, is dropped in Russia on a top secret mission to rescue a nuclear scientist, Sokolov, from the hands of the Russians. But soon things turn ugly. The rescue mission is botched, and a weapon of mass destruction, codenamed the Shagohod, is stolen from the Russians by terrorists. Not only this, but a nuclear missile is launched on to one of Russia&apos;s most important research facilities. Snake must return to Russia in order to set things right and prevent the breakout of a nuclear war. The premise of the game is that Snake must use stealth- not guns- to complete his objectives. Getting into a gunfight will more often than not get Snake killed. Instead, Snake must use his surroundings and good timing to sneak past the enemy and ensure the destruction of the Shagohod. Included with the release is the entire game of Metal Gear Solid 3- Snake Eater with a number of additions. The European Extreme has been added as an available difficulty level, being the hardest difficulty level in the entire series. New face paints and more camera angles have been added to the mix, as well as a myriad of other features including a Duel Mode, allowing players to face off against their favorite bosses anytime they want. Back by popular demand, Snake vs. Monkey has also returned with more maps than before! Besides this, included on the bonus disk is a new online mode that has been included with Subsistence. This new mode allows players to play MGS3 online with other players around the world. Sony&apos;s servers allow the player to keep track of stats and friends. Players can play with others around the world in different match types such as Capture mission and Sneaking missions. To wrap up the original trilogy, Subsistence comes with the original version of the MSX games Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2- Solid Snake. Never before released in America, the inclusion of these two games wraps up the entire series of games in the original trilogy of the origins of Solid and Naked Snake.</story>

Getting into a gunfight will more often than not get Snake killed. Instead, Snake must use his surroundings and good timing to sneak past the enemy and ensure the destruction of the Shagohod. Included with the release is the entire game of Metal Gear Solid 3- Snake Eater with a number of additions. The European Extreme has been added as an available difficulty level, being the hardest difficulty level in the entire series. New face paints and more camera angles have been added to the mix, as well as a myriad of other features including a Duel Mode, allowing players to face off against their favorite bosses anytime they want. Back by popular demand, Snake vs. Monkey has also returned with more maps than before! Besides this, included on the bonus disk is a new online mode that has been included with Subsistence. This new mode allows players to play MGS3 online with other players around the world. Sony&apos;s servers allow the player to keep track of stats and friends. Players can play with others around the world in different match types such as Capture mission and Sneaking missions. To wrap up the original trilogy, Subsistence comes with the original version of the MSX games Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2- Solid Snake. Never before released in America, the inclusion of these two games wraps up the entire series of games in the original trilogy of the origins of Solid and Naked Snake.</story>

    <story>A follow-up to the Metal Max games, Metal Saga is set in the same post-apocalyptic world as its predecessors - a world populated by bounty hunters, rangers, bandits, and mutant monsters. You take the role of a bounty hunter who has to travel the world, looking for wanted people. Accompanied by a soldier, a mechanic, and a cyborg dog, the hero must survive a journey west that will ultimately take him to remote places and lead him to battles against evil. Metal Saga has a less linear story line that one would normally expect from a Japanese RPG - a story line that develops according to the missions you decide to take, which in their turn lead to new events and finally to different endings. The combat system features traditional party management and turn-based battles, with the addition of Metal Max&apos;s trademark tank combat. When you acquire tanks for your characters, you can use them in battles. Tanks get damaged and broken, but you will be able to customize them by finding parts scattered across the world and assembling them to build new models. Based on the model of tank many different kinds of weapons, cannons, and accessories can be equipped to it, making for hundreds of different options. Tanks can even be given a custom paint job that is saved to the memory card.</story>

    <story>Metropolismania is a city building game with a Japanese anime style. The goal is to grow a town to a target population. This is accomplished by interacting with NPCs and becoming friends by giving them gifts and talking with them. Attract citizens by building up the town with offices, grocers, entertainment and farming buildings (to name a few). Rather than overlooking the environment, the player controls a character from a thirdperson perspective. Walking around, new constructions can be started and roads can be built. The buildings can be entered too. Side quests happen every level, some of which are quite strange. Expect to be involved in a smuggling ring or a cult.</story>

Played from a thirdperson perspective, the player needs to walk around, construct buildings, provide roads, and then screen the emails of possible inhabitants. Citizens need to be kept happy by interacting with them - give them gifts, listen to their gossip and complaints. If their needs are attended to (through schools, hospitals or entertainment), they will ditch the town. Build commercial, utility, entertainment industries to appease your citizens and make this a city people want to live in.</story>

    <story>Based on the 80&apos;s TV series of the same name, this is a 3rd person shooter. Playing as Sonny Crockett or Ricardo Tubbs, the player must dismantle drug-lord Ortega&apos;s organization, following the plot of an episode of the series. Through 14 missions, the player must take down (or arrest, sometimes) drug dealers and solve some minor puzzles (like finding keys to open doors, or switching levers to get access to locked places). In some stages, the player can choose freely to play as Crockett or Tubbs, switching between them by the click of a button. They have different abilities (Tubbs, for instance, is tougher and can kick in doors, Crockett is more agile), and different weapons (Crockett has a pistol as primary weapon, Tubbs has a double barreled shotgun). The characters can also carry a secondary weapon, from among 14 types (9mm pistols, .45 pistols, silenced 9mm, Uzi-like sub-machineguns, etc.). Each character can use only certain types of weapon, Tubbs carrying usually the heavier ones. The primary weapons have unlimited ammo, the secondary ones don&apos;t. In the stages where the player can choose either Crockett or Tubbs, basic commands can be given to the secondary character, such as asking for following the partner or covering him. The characters will heal themselves as the time passes, and they can heal each other- if one of them dies, the other can revive him. The characters can interact with the environment- whenever an action is possible, an icon will appear, showing which action can be taken, such as opening (or breaking) doors, climbing ladders, etc. Jumping is part of those particular actions, as the characters can only jump at specific places where the proper icon shows up. As for other actions, characters can run, crouch, walk and lean against walls. To shoot enemies, the player must aim (with an auto aim button) and then shoot (with a shoot button). The game features the original theme from the TV show, as well as original voices.</story>

    <story>In Michigan, players take the role of a rookie cameraman for ZaKa TV, the entertainment division of the powerful ZaKa conglomerate. Accompanied by Brisco, an outspoken sound engineer, and Pamela, a reporter, the player is sent to investigate a mysterious mist that has descended over the city. The player quickly discovers that the mist is somehow transforming people into fleshy, leech-like monsters with human limbs. Pamela is attacked by the creatures, and is later found in the process of transforming into one. The player, Brisco, and a new female reporter are sent to investigate the source of the monster outbreak. It is eventually revealed that the cause of the monsters is a mutative virus developed by a scientist, Dr. O&apos;Conner, intended to be used as a biological weapon against the enemies of the United States. The virus was developed with the complicity of the U.S. military, the U.S. government, as well as the powerful ZaKa group for whom the protagonists work. After unsuccessfully attempting to retrieve a vaccine for the virus, the camera crew attempt to evacuate the city by heading to an airport on the outskirts of the city where a military evacuation transport is supposed to arrive. At the airport, the group encounters a strange young man who appears to be intellectually disabled. He somewhat disjointedly reveals that he was Dr. O&apos;Conner&apos;s original guinea pig, and begins to run around and yell immaturely in a bizarre manner. After the player commands the reporter to shoot the strange man, he transforms into a massive pile of mutated flesh before exploding messily. With the man&apos;s death, the mist clears, and Brisco theorizes he was the cause of both the mist and the monster outbreak. In the game&apos;s epilogue, the camera crew approach a nearby lighthouse, which the military has ordered them to activate so that the transport plane can locate them and pick them up. While the tired reporter waits outside, Brisco and the cameraman ascend the lighthouse and activate the light at the top. Suddenly, Brisco begins to mutate; the cameraman flees, and the Brisco-creature laughs maniacally before escaping out a window. The game ends with a final film clip depending on the actions of cameraman. The cameraman attempts to reveal the identity of the people behind the virus on camera, but he&apos;s killed by an unseen assassin before he gives a name. </story>

Just like in Mad Tracks you drive little toy cars through 50 miniature-size all-day environments like over a pool table or through the eaves gutters of a house. On the tracks you can find weapons (e.g. a flamethrower, a monster-hammer or rockets) and power-ups that help you win the race. If you win a race you&apos;ll get money which you need to unlock new tracks and cars. In multiplayer mode up to 4 players can race against each other either on one PC or online. The PS2 version offers multiplayer with multitap and with the PSP version, you can play on one device (two players) or through WiFi (four players). Playing online also features a new twist in the races. If you want to, you can bet your car and if you lose your opponent gets it. You can also trade cars from your collection with others. An editor to design your own tracks is included in the package. Extra tracks can be unlocked by connecting the PSP to the PS2.</story>

This is the premise behind Midnight Club II, in which you must work your way up the ranks of illegal street racing by challenging and defeating the best over three cities. Each race occurs in a different area of the city, and all you have to do to get started is flash your lights at the person you wish to drag. Then follow the map for the track route and go hell for leather. Further along, shortcuts will also come into play, giving you an advantage in getting to the finish first. Each race you win racks up cash, which goes towards new and much faster cars for the more difficult challenges. You&apos;ll also get the chance to go two wheels with a selection of highly mobile bikes. Multiplayer modes include the usual all-on-all race mode, and capture the flag, in which you must race to the opposing flag somewhere in the city and return it to your destination.</story>

    <story>In MLB 06- The Show you can manage players, their salaries, keep up to date with the business of the team, check on the players team morale and keep them happy to keep your team in contention. Control everything of your business even to the prices of the tickets to even the prices of the vendors. It has a career mode where you can create yourself by using the game controls or by using EyeToy to paste your face on. You can keep tabs on yourself in career mode as and control which teams you want play for, but you have to earn you right to compete in the big leagues by battling your way up from the minor leagues. Keep track of your achievements as you progress and if you choose, you can even skip parts of the game to your at bats or pitching appearances, making the game much more streamlined and very personal. The players act very realistic due to the fact they used motion capturing for almost every major player, giving it untolds amounts of realistic animation and almost giving them real emotions, such as if a pitcher gives up a big home run, you can see the disappointed on his face or if you hit a game winning home run your entire team goes nuts celebrating. The game also comes with a fun set of mini games including the classic Home Run Derby and a new King of the Diamond, which has multiple levels, a timer and is constantly adapting to keep you guessing. The rosters even were up to date at the time, actually having the 2006 rosters instead of the previous year.</story>

    <story>Sony&apos;s baseball franchise returns for 2007 with updated rosters and classic features, such as season mode, managerial mode along with the classic career mode, but also has some new features as well. One of the new features is the Road to the Show, a new take on the career mode that expands last years version. Instead of playing every player on the team, the game focuses more on the player alone. It will fast forward to decisions tied to the player (i.e. fielding a ball hit towards your player or batting), but also gives you goals to complete (i.e. knocking in a run or getting on base or trying for a double play while fielding). Success of these goals will help you establish your place with the manager and team and give you a better chance for a major league start. It also features an Adaptive Pitching Intelligence, where the game learns more from your at bats or your pitching, but also has your catchers help you out more by picking signals out instead of just randomly selecting pitches. Another is umpire personality, where the strike zone is smaller or larger, depending upon the umpire calling the game at the time. The all-new New Pitch Command System (PCS) delivers comprehensive strategy to pitch selection, as a pitcher&apos;s pitch comfort will be predetermined based on a best to worst pitch scenario, letting you decide whether to stick with what is working or begin a new pitching regiment. PS2 and PS3 versions provide online league play, which also lets you check on real-time MLB scores and news while the PSP version also lets you play against others using Wi-Fi connection. It features an extensive MLB license, with most of the players with a few exceptions and also features Rex Hudler, Matt Vasgersian and Dave Campbell as color commentators, providing realistic coverage, almost giving it a TV feel along with realistic graphics, giving the players and the action a very realistic feel, such as a pitchers let down after giving up a huge homerun or a team rushing the field to celebrate after hitting a homerun, winning the game.</story>

The realistic baseball simulator includes a bunch of new features and improves on many of the faults of the &apos;09 version including online gameplay.

The all new Catcher mode allows you to call pitches from the backstop and control the game just like Minnesota Twins catcher Joe Mauer, the cover athlete for this edition. Homerun Derby also makes a return to the series as both a standalone mode and as an experience during the All-Star Break. Not to be forgotten is the Movie Maker mode which allows you to combine saved replays of a game to turn into a highlight reel and save to your hard drive, and also the updated Road to the Show 4.0 with new settings and stat features.</story>

Take control of all of your favorite Major League Baseball teams and players armed with all of their real stats, attributes, abilities and attitude. Slugfest features many playable minigames, a season mode, quick play and exhibition play. So what makes MLB Slugfest extreme? The game is far from a real baseball simulation. This is as arcade as it gets. Flaming fastballs that take out batters ankles (and reducing their stats), out-of-the-park home runs, dropkicking the catcher on your dash to home plate, kidney punching the batter who just ruined your no-hitter and many other brutal tactics bring sportsmanship to an all-new low. Graphic touches include real player faces and details such as chewing gum and talking to teammates or opponents. Real stadiums all make their appearances along with several fantasy stadiums that can be unlocked.</story>

In Mission mode create your own Federation or Zeon pilot and train their skills and abilities over eight missions.

Select from over 70 mobile suits (although your MS is usually chosen for you outside of Versus mode) with their own stats, equipment list, and special attacks. Combat takes place in 3-D space where you have complete control of a unit&apos;s forward, backward, and side to side movement as well as pitch and yaw. Boosting can be used to move faster, and barrel rolling will break any enemies&apos; target locks on your MS. Units are equipped with melee weapons as well as ranged weapons, but ranged weapons have limited ammunition and must reload or cool down after being expended. Missions consist of both auto-scrolling segments where the player must avoid obstacles and destroy visible targets as well as arena segments where the player must track down nearby targets. In Versus mode you can challenge either the computer or another player to one on one combat with a team of 1-3 pilots and MSs. Each MS and weapon has a point cost, and a team&apos;s total point cost can not exceed 300 points. Additional pilots and MSs can be unlocked by achieving high scores in the other modes&apos; missions. Ever wanted to pit Char in the Byg-Zam against Amuro piloting the Dendrobium?

    <story>In this version of the Mobile Suit Gundam series, a war as taken place between the The Titans and a splinter group of the Earth Federation called the A.E.U.G. Several years after the One Year War, the A.E.U.G. is formed from a group of disillusioned members of the Earth Federation and is now waging war against the Titans and it is up to the remaining members of the EF to team up with the Titans to stop this menace. The story revolves around a Gundam pilot named Kamille Bidan, who pilots the game&apos;s namesake the Zeta Gundam, but the player can also choose which side they want to fight for, either the Titans/Federation or the A.E.U.G. The gameplay mostly consists of traversing landscapes and destroying enemy mechs and completing objectives. The mechs can also convert into secondary vehicles such as jets with more powerful weapons as well.</story>

    <story>Monster Attack is a third-person action shooter and the first game in the Chikyuu Boueigun / Earth Defense Force series. The player takes the role of an EDF (Earth Defence Force) infantry man to single handily battle hordes of giant bugs, robots and alien ships that have invaded Earth, across 30 missions. The game eludes to other EDF forces, but they are never seen. You choose two weapons for each mission from dozens of various missile launchers, machine guns, flamethrowers and more unique weapons, some, faster, more powerful or better suited to the mission at hand than others, are given infinite ammo (though the weapons must still be reloaded after each clip is used up) and are set loose in one of several (usually city-based) fully destructible environments. Players can also mount a vehicles such as an air bike, a tank and a helicopter. The player recovers and increases his maximum health and armour, and unlocks new weapons by picking up power-ups from defeated enemies that spawn in and come at the player by the dozen. The game also features 2-player split-screen cooperative multiplayer.</story>

    <story>The house that old man Nebbercracker owns is alive and is swallowing whole anything that comes close to it. Three neighborhood kids DJ, Chowder, and Jenny decided to plan an attack on the house on Hallows&apos; Eve. There plans go array when police officers catch them attempting to break into the house and place the kids in the back of a police car. However, the house swallows the police officers and then swallows the police car holding the children. Now that the children are in the belly of the beast, they have to find a way to put a stop to this monster house. In Monster House players have to explore the house while taking on the role of the three children (the game will automatically switch to a different character as the story calls for it). Each child is armed with a water blaster and a melee attack to take out enemies. The water blasters reservoir will get drained each time it&apos;s fired and will require an occasional re-pumping to refill it. Also, each child has a unique limited ammo weapon, DJ has an instant camera which can stun enemies with its flash, Jenny has a slingshot which shoots marbles, and Chowder has water balloons to soak enemies. Players can find items like keys to unlock doors, cans of pop to regain health, and arcade tokens which can then be used to play a mini-game called Thou Art Dead, a side-scolling action game. The various bathrooms found through out the house are safe zones and will allow the player to save their game. Also, finding toy monkeys scattered through out the house will unlock game art which can be viewed in the game&apos;s Gallery mode.</story>

    <story>Monster Hunter is a third-person action game set in a kind of pre-historic fantasy world. Many of the creatures you&apos;ll see are very similar to dinosaurs, ancient relatives to modern day animals such as boars and insects, and even dragons. Next to a singleplayer mode, the game can also be played online. You can have a hunting party of up to four people, and once you start to go after larger prey, you&apos;ll definitely need them all. Every couple of weeks, Capcom organizes online missions. While some are harder than others, they all allow you the chance to create equipment you&apos;d never be able to get if you only played offline. Thankfully, you won&apos;t be fighting with your bare hands. When you first begin your game, you are given a simple sword and shield, but as you complete missions and harvest materials from both the creatures you kill and various nooks and crannies in the environments, you can begin to craft stronger weapons and armor for yourself. On top of that, you can also use berries, plants, shells and more to craft healing items, stat boosters and even ammunition if you opt to use a bowgun. There are several weapon types in Monster Hunter, including the bowgun (perfect for group support and long-range attacks), Great Swords (huge and slow, but very powerful and a great reach), and even Hammers (The most powerful weapon class, but cannot block). Most weapons can even be upgraded once you create them, allowing you to add damage, sharpness and even elemental attributes. The game is played out through missions you take from the Hunter&apos;s Guild (or the village elder if you&apos;re playing solo), and these missions range from material gathering, to egg stealing, and even live capture. Combat is all real-time. The left analog stick moves your hunter while the right stick is actually used for attacking. Different directions on the stick trigger different types of attacks, even allowing for some simple combos. The story in Monster Hunter is a very basic one. You want to be the best Hunter ever, so you go out to prove yourself. That&apos;s really all there is to it.</story>

    <story>Monster Jam is a monster truck racing game based on the existing TV-show under the same name, which also incorporates a series of live events hosted by Live Nation. Unlike previous games of Monster Jam franchise, Monster Jam includes 20 pre-existing trucks licensed specifically for the game by USHRA (United States Hot Rod Association). The game includes such well-known monster trucks as Destroyer, Bounty Hunter, Blue Thunder, Captain&apos;s Cruise, it&apos;s previous identity - Bulldozer and probably two of the most alleged kings of all monster trucks - Maximum Destruction, the winner of seven Monster Jam World Finals and Grave Digger, one of the most influential monster trucks of all time . At the beginning of the game only a small amount of trucks and tracks is available for choosing. The player is encouraged to participate in various events to attain career points which will unlock new items. The amount of points given depend on the player&apos;s performance in the following events- Freestyle - a classic monster truck challenge involves free-riding at the arena performing different stunts and interacting with the surrounding environment in the most destructive way possible. In this challenge it is advisable to keep the action going until the time runs out. Also, a combo of different stunts in a succession will result in magnifying the score. Track Circuit - an offroad lap-based racing through various types of countryside. Eliminator - is the classic knock-out race in which each lap eliminates the last truck to complete it. Stadium Circuit - is the same as Track Circuit with the action taking the place in the arena, and not at outdoors locations and the trucks competing at different tracks separated from each other. Stadium Racing - is a drag racing challenge in which players should boost their maximum speed in order to arrive first at the finish of a short un-circled track. Once the sufficient number points is achieved the player will be allowed to participate in Monster Jam World Finals to prove his right to be the ultimate champion of Monster Jam. The game makes heavy emphasis on it&apos;s fully destructible levels. Nearly everything player meets on the track may be crushed, moved or destroyed. The game encourages such kind of behavior by issuing additional points and allowing player to use nitro boost for a prolonged amount of time. The game may be played in two difficulty modes- Normal - is enough for everyone, while Pro is meant for die-hard Monster Truck enthusiasts only.</story>

    <story>Monster raising and creature contests move into the 128-bit generation as the popular Tecmo series sets up shop on the PlayStation 2 in this release of Monster Rancher 3. Though many characters and places are recognizable from earlier releases in the series, monsters in this game are represented in a cel-shaded cartoon style, similar to that of the Dreamcast&apos;s Jet Grind Radio or the contemporary PS2 release Yanya Caballista featuring Gawoo. The game receives improved graphics and some additional features with its move to the more powerful PS2 console. Most of the rules of play and monster-raising conventions established in earlier games remain in this version. Monsters develop according to the training and treatment they receive and players are encouraged to explore the game world to find new training opportunities. Players can generate monsters using other forms of media, as the game creates creatures according to data on music CDs and movie DVDs. While some aspects of creation are random, certain albums and movies may generate creatures specifically related to the artistic content on the disk.</story>

    <story>Raise monsters to explore and battle in this PS2 monster raising sim from Tecmo. This game improves upon previous installments by allowing more than one monster to be raised at once, interaction with the main character and the monsters, improved explorations, a customizable ranch, tag-team battles, improved 2P mode, a re-vamped battle system, and more detailed monsters. This game also features the longest most involved storyline of any Monster Rancher game to date. Your goal is to raise monsters to win in-game tournaments, explore for items, and improve your ranch. You can also test your raising skills by battling your monsters against a friend in 2P mode. The game still uses the innovative system of having a player insert music CDs, game discs, or DVDs into the PS2 to be read and used in making monsters. If you have a good sized collection of music, games, or movies, you can have access to a large variety of monsters very fast. Monsters can also be made by finding in-game items, and through combining your retired monsters, so having a large collection of discs is not necessary. The game features some cute monsters, some scary/gory types, and enough variety to keep almost anyone busy for a long time. Monster Rancher 4 is easy enough that almost anyone can dive in and play right away, making it a natural for kids. -But like the other games in the series, a patient player will be rewarded with a deeper, more rewarding experience (and hundreds of hours of gameplay). Replay value on this game, like the other Monster Rancher games is very high.</story>

    <story>Monster Rancher EVO is totally unlike any other games in this series, so fans beware, this may not be what you expect! Like the previous Monster Rancher titles, EVO does involve raising monsters, but that&apos;s where the similarities end. Gone is your ranch and in its place is a circus. You are still a monster breeder, but raising your monster is now a group effort. You train your monsters each day to perform tricks for a circus show, and they only gain stats (Life, Speed, Strength, etc.) during Showtime. Shows are performed once every few months. Performing shows is necessary for monster growth and circus popularity. Increasing your popularity will enable you to move the circus (and advance the plot) into other areas of the game. In addition to Showtimes, the game also includes Adventures, which those familiar with the series will remember. You go on adventures to obtain items necessary for mini-quests (there are many of those) and to further advance the plot. These adventures are full of challenges and ways to improve your monster, as in the other MR games. An important thing to remember about this game is that you are not the sole trainer. In face, you do very little training because you assign others in your circus group to do it for you. That being said, MR EVO is a very plot-oriented game, with less of an emphasis on combat than its predecessors.</story>

    <story>Monster Trux Extreme- Offroad Edition, as the name implies, is a Monster Truck arcade racing game. There are 3 engine classes to choose from- V6, V8 or V12. There are also 8 different trucks to choose from, and a total of 12 different courses (some of which consist in a previous course mirrored or in a different daytime condition). At first, only one engine class, two trucks and one courses will be available, the others having to be unlocked while playing the game. Each race is played against 3 computer opponents (or 2 in split-screen mode). During the races, 2 types of power ups can be collected- wrenches and nitros. Wrenches recover the trucks&apos; damage gauge, and come in two types, one that repairs one unity of the damage gauge and one which fully repairs the truck. Nitros can be used to boost the truck speed for a while, each one filling 1/3 of the trucks&apos; nitro gauge. If the player runs over yellow speed stripes on the courses, a little speed boost will be gained. Dollar symbols can also be collected, adding money to the player&apos;s profile. Money can be used to unlock new trucks, but it isn&apos;t spent- to unlock a new truck, the player only has to have the required amount of money. Money can be lost if the player depletes the whole damage gauge by bumping into obstacles or other vehicles- the truck explodes and respawns at the cost of 10 money units. </story>

    <story>Monsters vs. Aliens is based on the animated movie of the same name. During the course of the game the player takes control over three characters from the movie which all feature different gameplay elements. Missing Link, a mix between fish and human, has to survive levels which are similar to most licensed games from animated movies- a 3rd person platformer. The sections with B.o.B., a slime monster, are more puzzle oriented. He can swallow enemies or items and use them to spit on other enemies. These are also used to press switches and as safety procedure when crossing bars - if B.o.B. had nothing solid in him he would just slip through them. With B.o.B. the player also has to solve mazes and shooting sequences. The last character is Gigantika, a 15 meters high woman. She uses trucks as inline skates and has to avoid obstacles by jumping or mastering quick time events (pressing a displayed button in a limited time). In co-op mode the second player takes the role of a Dr. Cockroach and supports the main player with appropriate actions, e.g. shooting. The player can unlock a lot of bonus material, e.g. concept art, deleted scenes (in this case- levels) or audio commentaries.</story>

    <story>Boo has returned to Monstropolis and it is your job as Sulley (or Sulley and Mike in the GBC version) to get her back home. However, to make things difficult, Randal has destroyed her door. Avoid Randall and the CDA (Child Detection Agency) as well as other dangers as you try getting Boo home. This platform scroller will have you trying to find out where you have been as you make your way through multiple doorways, up and down ladders, and more. Pick up items along the way as you jump and dodge enemies, use your roar attack, push items, sneak, and more.

    <story>Mortal Kombat- Armageddon brags a roster of 62 characters and sees the return of classic ones from the original Mortal Kombat, such as Reptile, Shang Tsung and Goro. The enhanced Konquest mode (story/adventure mode) improves over the preceding versions, but has a shorter length. There are now 64 arenas (including revamped versions of classic environments) which each have their own tweaks, such as the ridiculous amount of stage fatalities (fatalities are a fancy way of killing your opponent, including classic techniques such as the spine-rip or arm-break). In the new Kreate-a-character mode, you can design your own character and clothe them with familiar or new costumes. As described earlier, fatalities are a fancy way of killing your opponent and are pretty fun to watch. Various button presses and combos at the end of a fight will sometimes trigger fatality mode and if the right buttons are pressed the fatality can become a chain of fatalities. The Kreate-a-fatality allows you to redesign these finishers. Perhaps the most amusing addition for longtime fans is the debut of Motor Kombat, a racing mini-game patterned after Nintendo&apos;s Mario Kart. Motor Kombat has players selecting a vehicle from the following ten characters- Sub-Zero, Bo&apos; Rai Cho, Scorpion, Mileena, Kitana, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Baraka, and Raiden. Each super-deformed driver performs his or her trademark move on rivals, from Raiden&apos;s electricity to Scorpion&apos;s spear attack. The themed courses also feature hazards of their own, including lava pools, spikes, fire, and more. Motor Kombat supports four players in a split-screen view, or up to eight online.</story>

By winning challenges, the player can unlock official Moto GP videos and photos as a reward. The player can customize his riding experience by choosing from three preset riding models- Arcade, Advance, Simulation. Setting gameplay on Arcade, the bike will be easier to control- front wheels will not lock during braking, the rider will not fall during powerslides and putting wheels on gras is not catastrophic. By setting gameplay on Simulation, the player has to manage front and rear wheel locking during braking, and highsides and low sides during accelerations. The grass becomes more slippery. Advance is a mix between the Arcade and Simulation. There are also different weather types for each track.</story>

After a short tutorial race during which the game helps the player to find the right driving model (Arcade, Advanced or Simulation) best suited for him, he can choose between different game modes with the career being the heart of the game. There the player creates a character, chooses a bike and a helmet for him and starts in the 125cc class with the goal to race to the top of the MotoGP class in only five years. After each successful race the player not only unlocks new content but also gains career points which can be invested into bike upgrades increasing the max speed, acceleration, braking abilities or traction. The other game modes are- 1. Time Trial - Beat the time records on the different tracks. 2. Tournament - Create a driver or choose a driver from the 2008 season to compete in a series of races. 3. Challenges - 50 challenges in seven categories demand a great deal of the player to unlock additional game content. Challenges include staying over a certain speed limit for a pre-defined amount of time or winning a 1on1 on the last few meters of a race track. The game also features a multiplayer mode for up to 12 players (not for the PS2 version). It is the first in the series to appear on the PS3. The game introduces the new US Indianapolis track and night racing at the Qatar circuit.</story>

    <story>In Mouse Trophy is a puzzle game where the player takes the role of a breeder participating at the Rodent Breeder World Championship. There the rodents have to survive mazes in the lowest time possible - of course with the player&apos;s help. The rodents act independently, the player can solve the puzzles by changing parts of the labyrinth, e.g. by opening doors. He also can interact with them directly by holding them or using gadgets like electric shocks. These gadgets are limited and have to be found by the rodents in the maze. The player has to manage up to five rodents at a time. After victories they get experience points and get smarter so the player doesn&apos;t have to guide them through every easy obstacle. Overall there are 15 rodents to choose from, e.g. a mouse or a squirrel, and 50 traps and accessories and 30 mazes.</story>

Repellent can be used on pests, the frying pan can knock out bigger baddies and a slingshot is useful for hitting faraway targets. A pirate costume can be used for a short time of invincibility. Various pick ups can be collected. Cat biscuits are needed to pay Teddy&apos;s ransom, while medi-teddies, first aid kits and fruits are used to restore health.

    <story>Mr. Golf is a one to four player golf game. This is not a simulation where real players and courses are recreated in minute photorealistic detail, this is a fun game where the players are all drawn in a cute cartoony style and the courses are all fictitious. There are two modes of play, stroke play or match play. Matches can be over three, six, nine or eighteen holes. Initially there are six characters to play as and just four courses but others can be unlocked by winning full eighteen hole matches. There is no player creation feature, no career mode and no difficulty settings in this game. There is background music and an in-game commentary which was a surprise but this is limited to stock phrases such as &apos;Nice shot!&apos;, &apos;You&apos;ve kept it on the fairway&apos;, &apos;Bad luck&apos; and so on. There is an in-game tutorial which covers all the controls. By default the right analogue stick controls the shot, the further back it is pulled the more power is transferred to the swing when the stick is pushed forward, while the left analogue stick aims the shot so that the player can allow for the wind. There is a game configuration option that swaps the use of the right/left sticks around. The &apos;best&apos; club is auto selected by the game but this can be changed by using R1/L1 to cycle through available clubs, R2/L2 change the player&apos;s stance. When taking a shot the player can take as many practice swings as they like to gauge how much back swing they want to use, the right D-Pad button swaps the player from practice mode into shot mode to take the actual shot. The full game has fourteen playable characters, eight courses plus &apos;mirrored courses&apos; all of which can be played in any of four seasons. </story>

    <story>MS Saga- A New Dawn is an RPG inspired by the Gundam series anime. Far in the future a machine called the G System is created which allows energy and materials to be turned into objects. Shortly after civilization is nearly destroyed by the machine, an event called The Great Fall. The games story begins after The Great Fall; what&apos;s left of mankind has begun to rebuild and stabilize a new society. One day a mysterious mobile suit arrives and initiates some random attacks on various towns, including an orphanage which is destroyed leaving only two survivors, Tristan and Fritz. These two survivors will then embark on a mission to take revenge for the destruction of their orphanage, and along the way will learn the mobile suit responsible for the destruction is part of even bigger plot to take over the world. At the beginning of the game you control Tristan and Fritz; as the story progresses, other characters will both join and leave your party. Each of the characters in your party has a mobile suit which is used to fight in battles as well as explore the vast regions of the world. You will also come across various towns where the characters can leave the mobile suits; in the towns you can talk with people, visit shops to buy items, rest to regain health and save the game, as well as learn about new missions to undertake. In most areas except towns (such as exploring the lands or in dungeons) you will encounter battles in both random locations and set locations; the set location battles are indicated by glowing crystals on the screen and are usually located strategically blocking an area you need to get to or to advance the story. The game uses a turn based battle system. Different types of attacks are available; hand to hand attacks tend to be more powerful but leave you open to a counter attack while ranged attacks are safer but deal less damage. On each turn each member of your party is given a limited amount of energy to use for attacks; different attacks use different amounts of energy. Lower powered attacks typically use less than the energy quota for a turn allowing you to save up the unused energy for a more powerful attack in a later turn. Each character also has a limited number of technique points which can be used for additional abilities such as healing, increasing armor, special attacks, and so on. At any given time up to three characters can be in the front line and take action in battles; any additional characters remain in the back line and are unable to attack, however you can switch characters around on each turn. As you win battles, experience points are earned allowing your characters to level up and become more powerful.</story>

    <story>Mushihimesama is a vertically scrolling shooter; players need to control their character over the constantly scrolling terrain and score points by shooting the various enemies that appear. Each of the five stages ends with a large &amp;quot;boss&amp;quot; battle. Like other games from developer CAVE, Mushihimesama is a &amp;quot;bullet hell&amp;quot; style shooter; the numerous opponents you encounter fire a very significant number of bullets, often completely covering the entire playfield. The player will need to either dodge these by navigating through the complex pattern formed or by utilising the shield that is available for a limited time. As is typical for arcade style shooters, weapon upgrades are available to make blasting enemies easier. Mushihimesama features three difficulty levels, original arcade, maniac, and ultra. In addition to these three modes found in the original arcade version, the PS2 version also adds a practice mode where any stage and boss battle can be practiced as well as the arrange mode. In arrange mode, the player begins fully equipped with weapon upgrades and changes are made to the scoring system.</story>

The other mode is a stunt-based motocross practice/competition mode where riders try to do as many crazy tricks in a crowd filled arena as possible within a particular amount of time. The game has a unique feature in that the bike has a controllable clutch (even for automatic gears) which must be mastered to succeed at the game. Correct use of the clutch when landing jumps of traversing troublesome terrain allows the rider&apos;s speed to be kept at a maximum. This must be used in conjunction with the Prime Jump button which must be held before a jump or bump to fly through the air.</story>

    <story>My Horse &amp; Me 2 is the sequel to the 2007 equestrian sports and lifestyle video game. The main differences- new disciplines (dressage, cross-country), added storyline, our horse has four parameters like cleanness, happiness, fitness and nutrition. The storyline is simple- We arrive to our uncle&apos;s ranch dreaming about starting horse racing. But the situation isn&apos;t going very well. No horse has won for a few seasons and even worse, some are falling sick. As the story unfolds we realise that the only way to get the ranch out from its financial problems is to win the final race in Kentucky. Other changes- new five mini-games loosely connected to the horse riding called fun games to unlock- Gather the foals, Play with a ball, Break in the Bull, Race with Katelyn, Labyrinth. In My Horse and Me on the Wii platform, the horse jumps automatically and we steer the horse by moving wiimote and nunchuck up and down. In the second part, we steer the horse by turning wiimote and nunchuck left and right. We can also choose whether we jump automatically or by pressing the A button. Differences in gameplay are only because of different control (wiimote / keyboard / pad). The game is also licensed by Federation Equestre Internationale FEI (International Equestrian Federation).</story>

    <story>Mystic Heroes is a fighting game loosely based on the novel Fengshen Yanyi (16th century). The player takes the role of a hero who fights against the evil ex-emperor Kang and his magical army. The gameplay itself is simple- the player wades through enemy hordes and kills them all. He has the choice between eight characters which all have different advantages and disadvantages - but basically the player chooses between sword and magical attacks. He can also use combo attacks. During the course of the game the player can find magical runes which give him additional magical abilities and power-ups, e.g. health and mana refreshments or temporary and permanent improvements to the attacking and defending statistics. In fact, some of these runes have to be earned by completing the story mode multiple times - the player can use the same character for this and gets to retain their abilities and statistics. Mana also replenishes with every defeated foe. Besides the main story mode, there is also a Survival mode. This version of the game features several additions in comparison to the GameCube version- increased magic levels (depending on the runes equipped), four new playable characters, a new boss, levels can be chosen separately after beating the game, plus the new Mission Mode. In this mode, the player has to solve small missions, e.g. defending a castle or escorting ghosts.</story>

    <story>NARC is a 3rd-person shooter that has the player tracking the distribution of the deadly new narcotic Liquid Soul across two different cities in Asia and the U.S.A. The player controls one of two characters - Narcotics detective Jack Forezenski (voiced by Michael Madsen), or D.E.A. agent Marcus Hill (voiced by Bill Belamy). Both are led by Narcotics chief Joe Kowalski (voiced by Ron Pearlman), and the player switches between the two as the story unfolds. As an undercover cop, players are free to roam the streets and dispense justice at their discretion. Aside from storyline missions, players can encounter 12 types of randomized street crimes and stop them to boost their badge rating (loosely, a measure of their trust within the police). Players can likewise flash their badge around to cause perps to surrender or run. Criminals that resist must be beaten in a small struggle minigame to get cuffed. Players can also arrest alleyway drug dealers and deposit their drugs safely at the station. Alternatively, the player can beat up drug dealers for their cash and stash, then sell the drugs to civilians for income. The player can also use the drugs themselves for temporary beneficial effects (ecstasy keeps enemies from attacking, speed makes you run and shoot faster, etc.) at the cost of badge points and the potential to become addicted. Excessive use of force against innocent civilians, or selling drugs to other undercover cops, result in major losses of badge points. Players have a maximum badge rating of 100. If it drops below 49, they are demoted to Patrolman and cannot take new story missions. The player must roam the streets in their police blues and stop enough random crimes to be moved back to Narcotics. If the player&apos;s rating drops below 24, they are kicked off the force and rendered jobless. Jobless players cannot fight or shoot weapons without attracting police attention. Further drops in rating cause the player to be wanted by the police, with a rating of 5 or lower spawning officers specifically to shoot or arrest the player. There are 25 hidden drug stashes in each city. Finding all of them will unlock the original N.A.R.C. arcade game for play.</story>

It is a fighting game with cel-shaded graphics resembling figures straight out of the manga. Ultimate Ninja contains twelve characters from the show, each with their own unique movesets and special attacks. In the overseas versions, two more bonus characters were added- Curse Mark Sasuke and Nine-Tailed Naruto. These were already playable in the Japanese version as a stronger mode for the regular characters, but split off into separate characters for the other versions. As such, the base characters cannot transform into these variations in the versions released outside of Japan. The characters can fight in several locations seen in the show and comics, such as Hidden Leaf Village, the Chunin Exam arena, and the Forest of Death. There is a main story mode with six battles and dialogue between the characters.</story>

    <story>Based on Masashi Kishimoto’s manga (and anime adaptation later) Naruto, Ultimate Ninja 2 is the second installment of the Ultimate Ninja series. The current Naruto game has cel shaded graphics and features the following modes- Ultimate Road, VS. Duel, Iruka’s Training, Naruto’s House and Tanzaku Market. 1. Ultimate Road- Ultimate Road is your basic story mode and focuses on the events that took place on the finals of the Chunin Exam up to the point where Tsunade agrees to become the 5th Hokage. There is also an additional story that revolves around Tsunade and becomes accessible when you finish the main story. The particular mode features pre-rendered backgrounds that you can freely move within and 4 locations including the Village Hidden in the Leaves and Tanzaku Town. To advance the story you need to talk to certain people and win a row of battles each time. With each battle you’re given certain conditions that should be met in order to win. Such conditions are simply to win the battle, fight till time is up or more challenging like win the battle – with enemy’s defense power high. For specific events you may also choose a support character, before the battle starts, that will appear at regular intervals to give you items like shuriken and ninja scrolls that can be thrown to the enemy. The battles are one on one and play like in Vs. Duel mode. When the battle ends you get money and points depending on how many of your available moves you used, how many items you used, in how many arenas you fought, etc. You can spend money on Tanzaku Market and can use points to customize your characters’ stats like Attack and Defense from the menu. From the menu you can also check any missions available. Missions are actually battles with conditions such as the ones that are mentioned at the beginning but are of wider variety and higher difficulty. 2. VS. Duel- A versus fighting mode where you can choose your fighter and the opponent from 32 players available to fight versus the CPU or a human player. You start with 17 players and can unlock the rest by talking to them or defeating them in a fight in Ultimate Road mode. In the battle you get your basic moves like the substitution jutsu, double jump, blocking, etc. that are the same for all the players and combos and special techniques that are different to each character and do more damage than your normal moves. The arenas have multi-layers and destructible objects that reveal items you can throw or points to replenish your chakra (it can also be replenished by throwing your opponent to the ground or holding down the down cursor button). Chakra is what some combos and all 3 levels of special techniques need to execute. When executing special techniques you are given the chance to interact with them. For example you may have to continuously push a certain button, rotate the right analog stick or press a combo of buttons that appear on the screen. If done correctly you may proceed to the next “stage” of the attack, add critical damage to it or reduce damage and/or cancel a technique if it’s initiated by the opponent. 3. Iruka’s Training- This is a practice mode where you can choose any of the 32 players available and master their moves. 4. Naruto’s House- Here you can view items bought at Tanzaku Market as well as enter codes. 5. Tanzaku Market- In Tanzaku Market you can buy Figures, Videos, Music, Ninja Info Cards, etc. that can be viewed at Naruto’s House.</story>

    <story>Naruto- Uzumaki Chronicles is a completely new story from the world of Naruto, known from the animated TV series. Many incidents have been happening lately around Leaf Village. It appears that Orochimaru is planning to destroying the Leaf Village and it is up to Naruto &amp; The Gang to stop him. This is the first PS2 Naruto game rendered in a 3D environment (no longer cel-shaded) with genuine CGI cutscenes. This Naruto game plays differently than the previous two PS2 fighting-based games because you have the option to roam freely and practice your skills before taking up the mission-based storyline. You can perform your basic melee combos and power strikes, as well as jutsu moves using chakra like sexy jutsu and shadow replication to name a few. Naruto can also transform into Nine-Tails Naruto when his health drops below a certain level. You can increase your health, stamina, chakra levels or learn new skills by purchasing them using virtue points earned by winning battles. You also gain allies to help you in battles, like Sasuke, Kakashi and Chouji.</story>

    <story>NASCAR returns with a new roster of drivers and features in NASCAR 07. The gameplay and available modes are fairly identical to the previous game (including the team racing controls), but the pace has been kicked up a notch, with an added blur effect to enhance the sense of speed. A new feature is the Adrenaline meter. When full, it offers improved handling and speed. Drivers now carry ranks with different attributes (Dynamic Driver Attributes) and racing tendencies. Specific drivers will perform better on certain tracks. Players can earn skill points to improve their attributes by keeping a lead, making clean passes, intimidation or survive dangerous situations. The main modes are Race Now, Season Mode, Chase for the Cup, Fight to the Top (Whelen Modified series, Craftsman Series, Craftsman Trucks, NBS, and NEXTEL Cup), Online Races (Quick Matches and Optimatch - where the host can fully define the event) and Dodge Challenges. The Dodge Speed Zone mode is no longer included. Important racers are shown in FMV interviews prior to Dodge Challenge races. As usual, the car can be tweaked and fine-tuned in many ways. This is the first NASCAR game to appear on the PSP. It is fairly similar to the console versions, but does not include Total Team Control to talk with the team. The handheld version includes a new feature- Instant Rewind. While racing, a meter builds up with time, which can be used to rewind the game action when crashing or taking a bad turn. A few of the game modes are different. Sterrance is featured on the US cover, as the driver for the #12 Alltel Dodge. The PAL release has Thomas&apos;s DeWalt Ford Fusion.</story>

After you get a contract, you can start racing. You can tune up your car in the areas of acceleration, tire wear, top speed, among several others. After a set amount of races, you will need to go through another time trial to get to the next set of races. As you complete races and gain reputation, more contracts will come in. In every race, you need to complete some objectives set in your contract. Some contracts are easy to complete (such as finishing a race), while others give more complex objectives (such as gaining several allied cars). Players can also race in the Craftsman Truck, National (Busch), and NEXTEL Cup. The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions allow players to share their setups online. The chase mode offers a series of challenges like drafting or passing to unlock new features. All versions offer online multiplayer races.</story>

Four new racing series have been added for this year; in addition to NEXTEL cup cars, players can race in the Featherlite Modified, Craftsman Truck, Nascar National (Busch), or production car series. Each type of car has its own unique feel and gives a different on-track experience.

Computer drivers will remember whether you drive naughty or nice, and will payback favors in kind. The new Intimidator feature allows you to shake up an opponent by getting behind him and putting on the pressure. In fight to the top mode, players can follow the career of their driver by starting in the Modified series and working their way up the NASCAR ranks. Performing well in races, as well as participating in autograph sessions, affects fan support, which in turn improves the driver&apos;s income. Online support for the PS2 and Xbox allow up to four players to compete in a full 43-car field.</story>

There are sixty challenges in all. When racing, what you do on the circuit affects future races. Ram someone into the wall or cause someone to spin out, and they&apos;ll remember. They&apos;ll try to get back at you in a future race. Help someone out, by clearing a path or sharing the draft, and they&apos;ll return the favor to you. Grudges and alliances are tracked throughout your career, so the more you piss someone off, the more likely they&apos;ll try to harm you. Like the Football Camp mode in Madden NFL 2004, the Speed Zone is comprised of different many games that will earn you points and increase your skill, such as passing and drafting, blocking and drifting. With the Career mode, you can go through a full twenty seasons before having to retire. You manage everything, from your pit crew and car parts to your sponsors and research and development. There are seventy officially licensed drivers and over 180 vehicle skins. If nothing suits you, create your own driver and car and see how you do. As in every 2004 edition of EA Sports console games, you&apos;ll find the EA Sports Bio, which is a career tracker that tracks your stats over every EA Sports game. The more games you play and the longer you play, the higher your level and the more rewards you can unlock.

    <story>NBA 06 deviates from other traditional NBA titles with the addition of The Life mode. While it does include classic features such as Exhibition, Season, Franchise and Multiplayer modes, but The Life mode is a take similar to the MLB- The Show. The Life has the player take control of an NBA rookie right out of college and just being drafted. Like the MLB Show series, the player can only control his character and cannot control others on their team or make any management decisions. The players role of the team will be determined by their performance on and off the court. The better the player is at playing basketball and being a teammate, the more likelier they will be a huge part of the team and receive better contracts and endorsement deals. Likewise, the decisions the player makes off the court will determine who they are perceived as well, such as how they interact with teammates, what they buy or who they hang around with. The player can also train their character through a series of 20 minigames, like one-on-one, three-on-three among others. The game also features Showtime Gameplay, where the player can increase his attributes and become a better team player with no-look alley-oops and highlight reel dunks. It also has online capabilities as well as the option of utilizing the EyeToy to put the user&apos;s face onto a created character.</story>

    <story>NBA 09- The Inside is the sequel to NBA 08 where once again the player can partake in a new chapter in The Life mode. This time around the player can take control of a created superstar (five total) with the ability to interact with three different characters and constantly change the storyline. The Team Progression System makes a return, rewarding the player for game exploration and completing certain achievements given to them throughout the game. Completing these tasks can unlock certain accessories that they can use for their created character, showing off their status. Players can also associate with various teammates and coaches, how they act towards these characters will determine their place with the team (being a team player and helping out others will have the coaches play you more and have create a bigger fan base and being a individual loner will alienate them from the team and have a smaller fan base). The obligatory game modes also exist in this version as well (Franchise, Exhibition) as well as updated NBA rosters with every NBA team available. The Havok engine is introduced for this version, giving the game a more realistic feel when combined with new animations and enhanced character models. NBA Replay also returns, letting players relive classic moments from the 07/08 as well as partake in the 08/09 season by downloading them off of the Playstation Network (five each week during the season). Players can also upload and share data, show off their created superstars and track their progress through leaderboards and even play against each other in online exhibition games. Audio commentary is provided by Seattle Supersonics star Kevin Calabro and franchise newcomer Kenny The Jet Smith.</story>

    <story>The 2005 edition of the NBA Live Basketball series has a new graphics engine, and adds new moves and signature moves to personalize the players. Another feature is Freestyle Air, with more control of players in the air, and the option to specify 10 different freestyle configurations. You can build your team over multiple seasons, and additional management in the Dynasty Mode is introduced through rookie scouting, along with a calendar to mark all the important dates. Management is based on dynasty points. By progressing, you earn points that can be spent on training sessions, new equipment, or to send out scouts all over the world. Different multiplayer options are offered, and events include a NBA all-star weekend with a Slam Dunk contest, a Rookie/Sophomore game and a 3-Point shootout, next to the regular game modes. You can also go freestyle anywhere in North America. The game has become quicker than the 2004 version, and the game strategies have been balanced by creating more emphasis on the mid-range jumper.</story>

    <story>NBA Shootout 2004 lets you play either a full season or exhibition matches of fully licensed NBA basketball with your favorite teams and players. Fully textured 3d players with faces of the top NBA players are mapped into the game. Listen to commentary by Ian Eagle and Bill Walton as they call the games right as you play. While there is no franchise mode like other more traditional sports games, there is a career mode where you create a character who tries to make his way up through the summer leagues and the NBDL. You&apos;ll be given challenges that you&apos;ll need to meet so that you can ultimately make your way to the NBA and get an actual contract to join a NBA team. Once in the NBA, you&apos;ll need to work even harder to win championships and titles so you can eventually be inducted into the NBA Hall of Fame. You can also unlock the 50 greatest players of all time by completing challenges in exhibition games like scoring a certain number of points or using a certain person to get a number of assists. Use a USB microphone to give your teammates commands to help. Give them commands on offense or defense about where to move so you can use your teammates effectively. Take your game online and play against the rest of the world. Look at leaderboards to see who the best person is, chat on message boards, participate in polls, read news, and even play in online tournaments.</story>

It also has new features such as a momentum meter, the more players either in favor or against a team, the more the meter will light up or darken, affecting the teams morale and success of plays. It also has a new kicking meter along with spring drills, letting players update their stats along with a new Spring Game where players can scout out their new players in exhibition games. Aside from the PSP version, Campus Legend is also a novelty - an update of the Race for the Heisman mode of the previous edition and it is quite similar to the NFL Superstar mode from the Madden franchise. A new player starts at football camp, practises and is eventually awarded a scholarship to play in a division. Rather than a single drill, it is now a series of four. Where in the previous version players could choose a scholarship, the game now offers a selection from the available schools based on the performances. Once enrolled, players choose a major, follow progress reports, read headlines in the school newspaper and have a dorm room where fan mail arrives. The player&apos;s girlfriend, shown as a photo of the wall, becomes more beautiful based on the success in the games. Days consist of attending classes, practice, studying, meeting tutors, drills or social activities. These can also boost popularity and overall success. Characters can be uploaded to Madden 07 where it can determine their draft position. The game is also aligned with ESPN, updating with real news from ESPN Radio and ESPN.com. It features the voice talents of Lee Corso, Brad Nessler and Kirk Herbstreit. The 360 version lacks the Spring Drills and Campus Legend modes. Instead it has improved graphics and a series of mini-games.</story>

    <story>NCAA March Madness 2007 is a college basketball game with a realistic simulation of basketball in an authentic college atmosphere. The crowds are rowdier and more colorful, and the AI is more focused on the team game rather than the individual match-ups seen in the NBA. You can play as one of over 320 division college basketball teams in various game modes, such as PlayNow, Dynasty, and Online. Dynasty mode allows you to take control of your school recruiting and other activities in order to build your team into a powerhouse that will win the NCAA championship. By winning players can unlock a cheerleading squad, a pep band and a student section. These influence the gameplay as the player can earn intensity points by performing well, effecting the chance of forcing a comeback. During the season completing challenges offers the opportunity to upgrade the facilities with a study hall, injury clinic, practice gym or a weight room and there is a higher chance players excel.</story>

    <story>The 2006 game in the Need for Speed series is an evolution of the gameplay introduced in the previous games. The career mode offers complete freedom in a city with a story mode supported by FMV cutscenes, as featured in Need for Speed- Most Wanted, but now also set in the Carbon Canyon, where racers duel for territory in the city below. There still are many police pursuits. At the same time, the focus on tuning and sculpting your car remains, as introduced in Need for Speed Underground. As you win money from races, you can visit garages and car lots to make improvements to your vehicle. Enhancements are still unlocked gradually, but the cars have now been divided over different tiers. There are about 40 cars to unlock. Many of them have been featured in previous installments, but there is a new selection and this year&apos;s edition introduces powerful muscle cars such as the Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger. Other features include the possibility to form your own crew, more detailed sculpting features, drifting races (introduced in NFS-U and replaced by drag races in NFS-MW) and the new car classes. The PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions offer online multiplayer, missing from the PS2, GC and Xbox releases. Up to eight players can race together, in the Pursuit Tag or Pursuit Knockout modes, with a few variations. Pursuit Tag is a race of one civilian car against cop cars. To become the civilian car, you have to tag it and then try to fend off the cops as long as possible until you are tagged again by other players. In Pursuit Knockout everyone starts as a civilian car, but the last one at the end of the first lap becomes a cop and needs to cause as much damage as possible to the other speeders. Another mode allows you to drive cooperatively (up to four players) in a single race. The city and the surroundings in the career mode have been divided into different territories, controlled by gangs. You are either invited or challenged to race in the sections and claim them as your own. To do so, you have to impress the gang leader by winning races until he challenges you for a duel - first in the city, then over the narrow roads of Carbon Canyon. Scores are based on proximity. You need to follow the boss in the first race, and he is in pursuit in the second one. There are 4 boss duels in total. The crew feature, with room for up to 6 cars, allows you to assign three roles to racers- drafters, scouts and blockers. These are supporting characters you can hire to help you win races. Drafters leave behind a coloured trail that makes it easier to find the way, scouts discover hidden shortcuts, and blockers try to cause mayhem to slow your opponents down. If you hire a scout, you get access to the new AutoSculpt feature. It enables you to modify the height of every part of your car through sliders, solely for visual effect. You can also buy full body kits.</story>

    <story>The Need for Speed series returns, this time reverting back to the &apos;chase&apos; arcade experience instead of a racing simulation. Top speed racing is the name of the game, where you must outchase not just the opposing drivers, but the cops. Choose from a selection of today&apos;s (and yesterday&apos;s) top sports cars, including the Ferrari F50, Porsche 911 and a range from the likes of Ford, Corvette, BMW, Lotus, Mercedes, Aston Martin, the McLaren F1 and a lot more. The competitive race mode allows you to take on other drivers and beat them to the line. A selection of tracks allows you to not only dodge incoming traffic, but perform deadly jumps and stunts to receive points. These points, combined with the points recieved from your finishing position, can unlock new cars and tracks. The Hot Pursuit mode combines all the major elements of the competitive mode with the chance to out run the cops. They will throw everything at you to try and stop you, including running you off the road, setting up road blocks and unleashing an attack helicopter equiped with missiles. Three busts by the cops ends the race.</story>

    <story>Need for Speed Most Wanted is in fact a cross between the Underground and the Hot Pursuit spin-offs. The player must gain notoriety by racing in the streets and attracting the attention of the cops in order to ascend in the Black List of illegal racers. In the end he must face no.1, Razor who tricked him out of his own car and used it to get to the top. Many racing modes are carried on from NFSU2 with the addition of Milestones, special events where the driver must evade capture and/or disable police cars by bringing down Pursuit Breakers, specially marked buildings such as gas stations and water towers. For each one of the 15 Blacklisted opponents, the player must win a specific number of events from each of the two main types and gain enough notoriety in the process. The player can invest bet money to buy new cars or improve his existing one&apos;s looks and performance so that he remains competitive. In Most Wanted, Josie Maran replaces Brooke Burke as the racer girl. The plot is furthered through use of FMV video with live actors and digital sets, which has been heavily enhanced so that it looks quite real.</story>

    <story>Need For Speed- ProStreet is the 11th game in the NFS series. It doesn&apos;t just include new and more detailed graphics, it includes a new type of gameplay. The game doesn&apos;t have a Free Roam mode (as in Underground 2, Most Wanted or Carbon), but it has an Event Map, similar to Juiced&apos;s Event Calendar. The player&apos;s main goal in this game is to become the King of the street. Nothing new. However, there are no more illegal races in the game - all of the available races are sponsored, and the action takes place on different racing tracks. No more traffic, no more in-town driving. The game features 2 gameplay modes. Career (you start your life as a lowlife race driver and over time you will conquer everyone) and free play (where you can race unlocked cars and unlocked tracks). As usual, the game includes a jukebox where you can listen to some singles, used by EA as the game&apos;s Sound Track. The game also includes new car models, and the classic racing modes except for cop chases, since ProStreet does not promote illegal racing. Also as usual, when you first start the game you will be prompted to create an alias (profile). You can choose which one will be loaded when you start the game again. After creating the alias, you are prompted to choose your difficulty settings. All versions, except for the PlayStation 2 and Wii, contain online multiplayer modes.</story>

    <story>Need for Speed- Undercover is the 12th installment of the series and puts the player in the shoes of an undercover cop who needs to infiltrate and destroy an international crime syndicate by getting to their leader - a man crazy behind the wheel and a very fast driver. So the player enters the city with the goal to earn enough reputation and respect in the syndicate to get to him. Of course this is not done by just walking up to someone and asking nicely. Instead the player freely roams the big city in his cars and accepts missions at every corner. These range from simple races to Burnout-inspired Destroy as much as possible goals. A completely new mode is the Highway Battle in which the player needs to put 300 meters between him and his opponent with the main enemy being the incoming rush hour traffic. Other missions require the player to bring a specific car in the best possible condition to a garage. Since the player is undercover, the police is always watching him and makes his life more and more difficult as the wanted level of the car increases. Successful races not only earn the player reputation to unlock new challenges and new parts of the city but also bring cash which can be invested in new cars or in the tuning of old ones. In addition one of the ten stats of the character automatically advances granting him more money for a win or increasing his ability to brake.</story>

By switching between the two at any time, players can use Tor&apos;s up-close melee attacks or cause damage from afar with Roberta&apos;s spells. This game stays faithful to the traditional third-person action-adventure. Magical items and weapons gained along the way will develop the characters&apos; abilities and strengths. In particular, elementally-aligned motes can be attached to weapons and armor as a combat bonus. There are many puzzles and side-quests along the way, and players will fight evil Neopets.</story>

    <story>NFL Blitz Pro is the 2003 entry in Midway&apos;s arcade football series. Like NHL Hitz Pro however, this entry moves away from its arcade roots toward more of a simulation style, while still retaining some arcade flavor in that there are no penalties or injuries and players can catch on fire. The main changes to the predecessors are full 11-on-11 teams, standard 10 yard downs and more support for running plays. Game modes include Quick Play and Exhibition, a full Season, a 10-season Franchise and 4- or 8-player tournaments. There also is a create-a-player feature. While there are no hot routes and audibles are limited to a pre-determined set of four, the Impact Player feature allows control of one specific player who can make last-minute adjustments. Only the PlayStation 2 version includes an online mode for multiplayer games and roster updates. The game has many special features unlockable through the Blitz Shop. Credits for the shop are earned by performing feats in non-franchise games. Available for purchase are fantasy teams and stadiums, and new game modes- in Butterfingaz mode, every hit leads to a fumble, while Cyberleague features robot teams and an exploding ball. Also available is the customary Big Head mode, among several others. Old-school Blitz series arcade gameplay is available in Blitz Classic mode.</story>

    <story>Play a full season with your favorite team or try the franchise mode and build a legacy. You can even create teams and players. In general manager mode, when you go into the off-season, several different things happen. First, you&apos;ll see a list of players who have retired from your team and the reasons they&apos;ve left, which are usually related to injuries or diminishing skills. If you lose some key players, then you&apos;ll need to make every effort to ensure that those positions are filled by free agents with similar skills or rookies who have solid potential. You&apos;re frequently stuck with trying your luck in the draft, where you can select a rookie based on how you finished the season, like in the real NFL draft. GameDay has a feature that gives you a breakdown on the draft and provides you with an overall rating for each rookie. Following the draft, you have to sign your rookies with whatever cap money you&apos;ve set aside for that purpose. When you&apos;re all done, it&apos;s time to start the next season. There&apos;s also a tournament mode where you can select up to 16 teams. There&apos;s also a regular season mode, similar to the franchise mode, except it lacks the off-season part. GameDay&apos;s best new feature is online play support. You can view your online stats, and see who the best players are online to challenge.</story>

    <story>NFL Street 2 is the second game in EA&apos;s arcade football series. Players try to become the world&apos;s best urban footballer by conquering other teams using several gravity-defying tricks like up-the-wall passes, off-the-wall catches, and highlight-reel wall jukes. Like the other games in the Street franchise, the game is played with a small amount of players and a focus on arcade gameplay. Unlike the first game, the walls can now be used for run-up passes and receptions, or bonuses by aiming for posters and hotspots. There are twelve arenas to compete in (2 unlockable) and the players are licensed from the 2004 NFL rosters. Multiplayer is available on the PS2, PSP and Xbox versions. In singleplayer, there are various game modes such as NFL Challenge where the player has 150 days to build a team to take on a squad of legends. Progress is based on milestones where you sharpen specific skills to reach the top or beat sufficient teams. When five days are left, the team enters a final tournament. Another one is the new Own the City mode, where the player create a new character and has to win all street games in the city. New players need to be recruited from pick-up games. The final team to beat consists of rapper Xzibit and a team of NFL stars. Characters created in this mode can be imported into the NFL Challenge, but also in Madden NFL 06. The PSP version is a faithful port, with some of the cut scenes removed, and 3 new street modes added for Wi-Fi multiplayer- Street Slalom (an obstacle course), Style Point Challenge, and Style Standoff, a end zone dance contest, similar to Space Channel 5, next to the regular multiplayer modes. Up to four players can play on a single PSP in the Party Play game modes such as the 2 Minute Challenge and Jump Ball Challenge.</story>

    <story>New rules and updated rosters and season schedules feature in this update of the longrunning NHL series, as do many new features. Deking is now performed using the left analog stick, with swift signature moves of star players that confuse opponents and reward skill. The same stick is used to increase the accuracy when shooting. While preparing for a shot, a bull&apos;s-eye appears in the enemy goal and you can quickly move the target to the corners for precision. To add to the individual qualities, statistics such as speed and size are now reflected during gameplay in the players&apos; momentum and turning radius. To get past opponents quickly, you can generate momentum for quick speed boosts. With the introduction of R.P.M. (Realistic Puck Momentum) dynamics, there is more randomness with the puck, as a shot off the mask can now stun goalies. Another small addition is the deformation of the ice during the match. In the player creation mode, where you can now apply bruises, broken noses, black eyes and scars to your players, the thumbstick is used for face sculpting - changing the different features. All the regular game modes are present, of which the Dynasty Mode from the previous version is the most complete, with scouting and full management options, inside and outside the arena. Contrary to the last game, you can now intervene during simulated AI games and win the match for your team. The PC, PS2 and Xbox version support online multiplayer games, and as a special bonus, the original NHL 94 game, one of the first in the series, has been included with the PS2 edition.</story>

In addition to NHL teams, this edition also features international teams and the 29 AHL teams, as well as the new jerseys for the regular NHL season. The PS3 and Xbox 360 version do not contain a fantasy draft to create a dream team to take through the Stanley Cup in the Dynasty mode, but have the Sweden&apos;s Elitserien and Finland&apos;s SM-liiga.

The defensive stick control has also been revamped and now allows for example to prevent direct passes. And it&apos;s possible to control both puck and stick with one hand in the offensive, allowing the player to better outplay the goalie. Of course all this complicates the already complex controls even more so that now it&apos;s possible to switch to the control scheme from NHL &apos;94 which only needs a few buttons and one analog stick to be successful.</story>

Players can start the game right away in play now mode, play an international game, play through a playoff series, or start a franchise. The franchise mode puts you in charge of a team for a 10-year legacy. You can either play every game during a season or simulate each game and take a manager role. After each season, you have the option to play around with the roster in anticipation of next season. You can draft new players, sign free agents, make trades with other teams, and retire old players. Statistics are kept throughout the life of a franchise in several categories. Also new this year is the use of the right analog stick to execute manual dekes and slip the puck past the goalkeeper.</story>

    <story>The best selling pro hockey franchise is back with the 2004 edition, and it&apos;s loaded with more. Like Madden NFL 2004, NHL 2004 has a deep career mode, titled Dynasty Mode. You take on the role of GM for up to twenty seasons. As GM, you&apos;ll have to negotiate contracts, conduct drafts, make trades, sign free agents, make sure your players are getting the training they need, and more. If you&apos;re good enough, you may make it into the GM Hall of Fame. Besides Dynasty mode, you&apos;ve got the basic game modes; Season, Exhibition, and Playoffs. The control for NHL 2004 has been refined, allowing for more precise movement than in the previous games. Precise passes, shots, and accurate skating are accomplished by simply tapping the button. NHL 2004 features a new fighting engine, allowing for more accurate and realistic fights. The right analog stick controls Bruise Control, which lets you perform different moves by tilting the stick in different directions. Before you get into fights, you&apos;ll need to agitate a player, and this is where his Agitation Meter comes in. Losing the game, being checked, making sloppy passes all raises his Agitation Meter, until he is ready to burst and will fight at the slightest poke check. NHL 2004 contains the EA Sports Bio, which is a feature found on all console versions of EA Sports game. Playing more EA Sports titles, playing them for a long time, and winning special accomplishments (such as your first shutout in NHL 2004 or your first number one finish in NASCAR Thunder 2004) will earn you a higher Gamer Level, and will reward you with bonuses, such as cheat codes and new stadiums. This feature isn&apos;t found on the PC version. In addition to the standard roster of NHL teams, there are thirty nine international teams for you to choose from, such as Germany&apos;s DEL or Sweden&apos;s Elitserien, plus the usual U.S.A., Canada, and other regulars. The PlayStation version of NHL 2004 supports online play.</story>

    <story>NHL 2K3 is the first hockey game on the XBox to support XBox Live. Using it&apos;s partnership with the ESPN sports network, Sega has created NHL 2K3 using the same presentation method as ESPN. Natural camera transitions, cut scenes, and overlay graphics are all used in cooperation with ESPN to give the game a more realistic feel. All the standard game modes are here, from exhibition games and playoff games, to a very in depth Franchise mode that gives you complete control over your team. You act as the general manager, coach, scout and player. You can negotiate contracts, make trades, and draft rookies. On the ice, you have a lot of control over your team as well. You can anchor lines with key players, rotate your lines to always be matched up, and make sure you have the advantage every which way. You can also play online via XBox System Link or XBox Live. The latter allows you to connect to a player from anywhere, and engage in a game of hockey. Using the headset, you can taunt or compliment your opponent, without any interruption to the game. Rosters are from the 2002-2003 season.</story>

    <story>Updated to the 2007 NHL season, the NHL 2K7 ice-hockey game also includes a few changes from NHL 2K6, including an improved camera that gives a better view of the action while still showing the field. This parametric camera is closer down than a typical top-down camera and includes automatic zooming and turning based on the players&apos; position on the ice. Other improvements are the option to shadow opponents to put pressure on them and increase their chance of making a mistake. This is done by holding the left bumper and steering the right control stick towards another player. The amount of pressure can then be determined through taps, with hard tapping inevitably leading to a powerful check. Aside from that, the game modes from the previous version are identical, as is most of the gameplay and the mini-games included. It has a new rivalry system where statistical bonuses and takeaways are created depending on how players play in games against their rival teams. The main improvements introduced to the Xbox 360 version of the game, such as the cinematic presentation system, are not carried over. This is most visible in the graphical area.</story>

    <story>NHL 2K9 is 2K Sports&apos; entry into Hockey gaming for the 2008-2009 season. The game is built on the same engine that many of the previous 2K hockey games used, and features include Season, Franchise, 2-on-2 Mini Rink, 4-on-4 Pond Hockey, and Shootout modes. Season Mode allows you to take basic control over an NHL team and guide them through an entire 82-game schedule, as well as (if you&apos;re good enough) the playoffs. Franchise is like Season Mode, but much deeper. In it, you guide a team through multiple seasons of hockey, and have control of options like drafting, contract signings, free agency, and hiring staff. The 2-on-2 and 4-on4 modes allow you and a friend to hand-pick a team of players (3 or 5, depending on the mode) and face off in a wide-open, arcade-style hockey game. Shootout works exactly like a shootout in real hockey- three skaters per side alternate taking shots at the goaltender, and most goals wins. Aside from game play modes, you also have the option of creating your own player or your own team from scratch, as well as modifying the existing roster (ie make trades, edit line combination) to your taste. NHL 2K9 is the first NHL Sports title for the Nintendo Wii. The Wii version features motion controls for shooting, passing, checking, and even fighting. There&apos;s also a new system for those who like to take control of the goaltender, which involves mimicking controller movements as they flash up on the screen in order to make saves. The PS3 and XBOX 360 version include online play, in which you can jump into a quick game with up to 11 other players, or participate in online leagues or tournaments. In the broadcast booth, Bob Cole and Harry Neal have been replaced by the San Jose Sharks&apos; announcing team of Randy Hann and Drew Remenda. The game soundtrack mainly comprised of energetic rock tunes, and features the likes of The Offspring, Bad Religion, and Mastodon.</story>

Franchise mode is where you pick and name your team, name your players, and play against other teams to earn experience points. Those points can be used to upgrade your players in categories such as toughness, speed, passing, and agility. After beating all the lesser teams in a tier, you can move on to battle a boss team for that region.

    <story>NHL Hitz Pro is Midway&apos;s 2003/2004 entry into the licensed hockey market. For the 2004 sports season, Midway introduced a directive to move their sports titles away from over-the-top arcade-style gameplay, and introduce a more sim-like approach to sports. For NHL Hitz Pro, this meant moving away from 3-on-3 hockey to 5-on-5 hockey gameplay to make the game more authentic for the demands of the sim hockey player. While NHL Hitz Pro still maintains many of the arcade-style elements that were a signature feature of the Hitz series such as checks over the boards and hits through glass, the gameplay has been tuned to provide an experience that is accurate to the sport of hockey. That being said, the player has extensive options for tuning the gameplay for either a fast-paced arcade experience, or a slower, more sim-like style of play. As with competing titles, Hitz Pro supports a franchise mode, season and exhibition gameplay and a game tutorial/practice mode. The title also sports a pickup hockey mode with several environments that are reminiscent of playing hockey in outdoor venues.</story>

    <story>NHRA Drag Racing- Countdown to the Championship is a simulation of drag-racing. It features four different classes of car (Top Fuel, Funny Car, Pro Stock, and Pro Stock Motorcycle), with the PSP version having Jet Powered as a bonus in Quick Race mode. There are 5 modes- Tutorial, Quick Race, Single Event, Career, and Vs. The tutorial is a series of videos that walk the player through the steps needed to properly race without getting disqualified. Quick race lets the player select a vehicle, driver, and weather, then simply race. (Unique to the PSP version is the ability to race different classes against each other, with the less powerful car getting a head start.) Single event mode strings together multiple races. It includes 4 qualifying rounds, then the top 16 racers will move on to an elimination tournament. Career follows a driver through multiple events, tracking money from wins and spent on repairs. Vs is a quick race between two human players. On the PSP, this is done through ad-hoc wireless; on the PS2, split-screen. There are three difficulty levels- rookie, veteran, and pro. Higher difficulties have tougher opponents, and require more precise aiming. In addition, rookie difficulty allows for auto-align on the track, and auto-tuning during the pre-race tune-up. No matter what game mode is being played, the pre-race tuning is incredibly important. There is only a limited amount of time (5 minutes in rookie difficulty, 3 otherwise) to pick the best settings, and everything from tire pressure to weight distribution is included. Finally, additional drivers can be unlocked by winning championships in career mode.</story>

    <story>Nicktoons- Attack of the Toybots is a side-scrolling platform game. It involves popular characters from several Nicktoons franchises such as Spongebob Squarepants, Timmy Turner, Jimmy Neutron, Gir, Ren, and Tak. Professor Calamitousfuels his army by feeding fairies krabby patties. This makes them emit a gas that, when mixed with ghost energy, can fuel robots. When Patrick Star and SpongeBob SquarePants deliver a large amount of krabby patties to a house, they are all sucked up and accidentally Patrick is taken along. After selecting a character, players traverse the insides of Professor Calamitous&apos; toy factory to fight evil robot copies of themselves. The main gameplay element of Nicktoons- Attack of the Toybots is the platforming style which involves actions such as jumping across gaps, balancing on moving terrain and collecting blue energy cubes to use as currency for unlocking more playable Nicktoons characters. Furthermore, the side-scrolling manner of play is broken up by bonus levels which allow the player to take control of a Mech suit used to destroy the Professor&apos;s factory. There is also an option for a second player to join at any time for co-operative play. The game features levels set in different universes based on the franchises of the different characters. For each level and universe, a different set of characters becomes playable.</story>

    <story>In this turn-based dungeon crawler you play as Gil, whose beloved fiancee has been kidnapped by a sorceress and taken to the Tower of Druaga. Gil puts on a suit of armor that radiates light, and proceeds into the dungeon to save his beloved Ki. The combat system and exploration might be the best part of the game. The map is set up in a grid, and you do everything in turns, like moving, battling, or recovering. The timing of moves is also critical, and the game feels like a real-time game because you aren&apos;t waiting like you typically would for turn-based games. The Nightmare of Druaga- Fushigino dungeon is a collaboration between the Mysterious Dungeon series and the arcade classic The Tower of Druaga.</story>

    <story>The Nakatomi company is searching for the pieces of the Akujiki sword, shattered by Hotsuma in the prequel, Shinobi. Luckily, the Oboro ninja clan has since reformed. As Hibana, kunoichi (female ninja) of the Oboro clan, you are charged with the task of finding the pieces of the Akujiki before Nakatomi does. Nightshade is a sequel to Overworks&apos; Shinobi for the PS2. Like its predecessor, it features several levels full of challenging enemies to fight using a combination of your sword, shuriken, and magic scrolls. Speed and stealth remain the emphasis, as you use stealth dashes and the ability to walk on walls to perform long strings of kills called tates. One of the main improvements to the gameplay system is the ability to create much larger combos/tates. In order to facilitate this, they&apos;ve expanded the battle system to include flying kicks to break your opponent&apos;s guard and stealth attacks to kill unsuspecting foes in a single blow.</story>

As regards the jelly monsters, enraged bees and snapping cupcakes, they can be attacked by distance attacks and close ones, employing Ninja Stars, Samurai Kicks, the cutting sword obviously, and more.</story>

    <story>Nobunaga&apos;s Ambition- Iron Triangle is another entry in KOEI&apos;s long-running series of historical simulators. As in the previous instalments, the player assumes the role of a Japanese feudal lord during the famous Sengoku period (from the XV to the XVII century). The main game screen shows an overhead 3D rendered view of the landscape, showing buildings and moving armies belonging to each clan. The player gives orders using a menu with a list of commands, that branch out with several options- City (to construct buildings), Personnel (to employ officers), Military (to move and attack with the army), Strategy, Diplomacy (to negotiate treaties and exchange technology) and others to review the resources. The game is paused while issuing the orders, and they are only executed when in Active mode, where time passes and seasons change. The different seasons have an impact on certain resources and activities, like harvesting and drafting. The scheduled actions and rank position of the clans can be reviewed at any time, on a separate screen. The game has several scenarios and special modes, with historical notes coming up when the game time synchronizes with some major events in Japan&apos;s timeline.</story>

    <story>Nobunaga&apos;s Ambition- Rise to Power is the first instalment in KOEI&apos;s long-running Nobunaga&apos;s Ambition strategy game series to feature full 3D environment. The player once again take the role of Nobunaga Oda, or one of his rival warlords, and set to unify 16thy century Japan under one ruler. The scenarios spans from 1551 to Nobunaga&apos;s death in 1582, and feature hypothetical &apos;What if&apos; turns of event. The many characters present in the game affect how events turn out with their unit stats and skills. From the castle and surrounding areas, the player issues orders to manage the resources and growth of the land under the warlord&apos;s control. The construction of the village and the life of its people evolve in real-time. In battle, either field battles or sieges, up to 24 units on each side ranging from spearmen to cannon troops can engage in real-time 3D battle. Routing the enemy lowers their morale, which allows the use of charges and counter attacks. In siege battles, the adequate use of skills and resources is key to victory. When most of the land is under the player&apos;s control, the &apos;Kessen&apos; command becomes available. Kessen is an all-or-nothing all-out attack that will either result in the unification of the land, or the total loss of the player&apos;s land.</story>

There are more than 30 high-tech flying machines to choose and pilot (including the notorious Taxi and the cool police car). There are four different modes available in NYR, the main one being the Championship mode that takes place over four different categories; Qualification, Beginner, Pro and Expert. Other modes include Single Race, Time Attack and the rather cool Keirin mode, that eliminates the contestant in last place at every checkpoint until the last man remains. In every race, you can pick up 4 elements which give you an added advantage- Water - leaves a liquid sphere behind you that slows your opponents down if they hit it, Fire - allows you to shoot a homing fireball at your opponents, Earth activates a temporary shield and Air - gives you a speed boost. 3 Dimensional action allows the player complete freedom of movement on a vertical and horizontal axis. The races take place on 12 tracks, which can be unlocked by advancing through levels. The tracks are divided into four districts- Jet Set, Middle Class, Seedy District and China Town.</story>

    <story>It has been two years since the incident at Leafmore High you witnessed in ObsCure and the survivors of the nightmare moved on to a university of Fallcreek. When they killed Herbert Friedman, the conductor of the biological experiment with the black flowers, they assumed everything was okay, of course it was not. The seeds of the flower had already spread around and it grew and blossomed without much notice. When it was discovered, that the flowers contain a dangerous substance that induces strange but vivid dreams, it became the new hit drug on the campus. Now the seeds begin to germinate and the bad trip turns into a horrible nightmare. The only ones that really know what is going on are the ones that are experiencing it for the second time and hide terrible secrets inside themselves... Most of the time you take control over two of the six available characters. Each one has a speciality that comes in handy in order to open blocked doors or reaching new heights. Kenny for example has more muscles than brain and is therefore able to move around crates. Mei is instead a hacker and knows how to hack access panels. You can switch between both characters at any time and if you need another character in a given situation, you can go back to a gathering point and change your team. But their wits alone can&apos;t save them from their doom so they also find several different weapons ranging from melee-weapons like a baseball bat to pistols and other weapons with a serious punch. You can also pick up chairs and tables to throw at your enemies. Early in the game you also gain a syringe with which you take samples off the dead creature-bodies. Once the syringe is full you can use it to gain a temporary boost of your abilities. As a multiplayer-treat the game features Drop in/Drop Out-coop which allows you to play the game alone and if someone comes and visits he or she can just take over the second controller and play with you. The camera is a mixture of following the character and being at a fixed position in a room but to reduce the amount of blind spots, you can also control it to a certain amount.</story>

The action gameplay is similar to Princess Crown, but does not limit enemy encounters to one-on-one fights, instead, all fighting happens in real-time as the player progresses through circular areas. Upon defeating enemies, the player is rewarded with items and experience in order to level up the attack strength and magic capabilities of the character. Players can also plant seeds during combat that will grow as they absorb Phozons released by defeated enemies, eventually producing edible fruit. Phozons can also be absorbed by the character to power up their weapon.

    <story>Okage- Shadow King is an RPG with a slight twist- it&apos;s humorous. The game&apos;s premise is that a boy (nameable by the player with the default name of Ari) makes a deal with an evil spirit to cure his sister of a curse that&apos;s caused her to speak entirely in pig Latin. The spirit, Evil King Stanley Hihat Trinidad XIV (or Stan for short), assumes the role of your shadow and orders you to track down the lost remnants of his power, which have been siphoned away by impostor Evil Kings over the last few thousand years while he was trapped in a bottle. And, while you&apos;re at it, Stan would also like you to help him take over the world. The game plays similarly to most JRPGs. Ari will visit towns and fight (turn based) battles against monsters - which in this game happen to be things like wild cows and man eating onions. Party members level up and gain new skills as they gain experience. Ari can respond to the story and other characters with a number of different dialogue options, such as a nice response, a rude response, or a silly response, and how he acts will affect how different party members feel about him.</story>

    <story>From Capcom&apos;s Clover studios, the team behind Viewtiful Joe 2, comes a 3-D cell shaded action adventure in the world of feudal Japan. Okami tells the tale of a wolf-goddess named Amaterasu who must prevent an evil being known as Orochi from taking over the beautiful world of feudal Japan. Okami takes the already well established cell shading technique and turns it into a traditional Hokusai-style Japanese woodblock print visual. To give the player a sense of being in a painting, Amaterasu is given a paint brush in which the player can cut enemies down with, create bridges or wind, and restore the forest to its natural beauty. With each defeated enemy, color returns and the natural life force slowly regenerates. While playing, players call up a canvas where they can draw with the celestial brush. New abilities and techniques are acquired as you progress. Okami is filled with large worlds and dungeons to explore on your quest to restore the lush trees and wildlife to their former glory.

    <story>One Piece- Grand Adventure is a fighting game based on the manga and anime franchise One Piece, by Eiichiro Oda. The game is pretty much similar to the previous One Piece- Grand Battle!, instead Grand Adventure features more playable fighters (adding new characters that appeared in the series over one year), modes and options than the previous game. It&apos;s playable by up to two players, where fights take place on a 3D stage with live environment, like bombs, sandstorms and sea waves, besides various items that serve either for buff or weapons. Single player features a story mode which follows the suit of the original series, on which the player as a pirate captain must gather a team and fight their biggest rivals.</story>

    <story>One Piece- Grand Battle is based on the Japanese anime of the same name and is actually the fourth game in the Grand Battle series. This installment features cel shaded graphics, 14 characters in total – 5 playable and 9 that you have to unlock – and has 5 modes for you to play and 2 others where you can view unlocked art of the characters. The Grand Battle mode is where you can fight against human players or CPU players and has most of the characters unlocked from the beginning. Story Mode is where you’ll spend most of your time since this is where you can unlock the rest of your characters and other staff like screenshots of the anime. Mini Games, as the name implies is a mode for playing mini games. Usopp Pirates challenge you to a series of 3 mini games. You begin by selecting three players for your team and each time you win a game you can select a member of the team that lost. Of course the opposite can also happen if you lose a game. Grand Tourney is a multiplayer battle tournament where you can set up to 16 human or CPU players to compete. I believe Training mode is pretty much self explanatory. And there are also 2 other modes – Treasure and One Piece Art. Basically this is where you can find all the staff you have unlocked like character endings, costume art and staff like that. Characters have basically the same button presses to perform attacks. Other than that each one has a support character that he can call to aid in the battle and 2 different unique attacks that can be used if certain conditions are met. There is also another unique attack for each character, with a long animated sequence that if you use when low on energy the enemy can be defeated with only one blow.</story>

    <story>It&apos;s 2032. The planet is now ruled by the World Coalition Government which annexed 80% of the countries, with the remaining quickly dragged into the WCG. While their official goal was to solve humankind&apos;s problems, it was about money. Massive spending bankrupted poorer countries, and soon all traces of individual government disappeared. For those who were poor, the situation didn&apos;t improved one bit, and for the richer, maintaining the status was done at the expense of their privacy and personal freedoms. To make things worse, life outside the major cities, far from the atmosphere processors is nearly impossible, as the so-called Wilderness Preserves are poisoned, and those who venture into them risk a painful death. Konoko, fresh out from TCTF (Technology Crimes Task Force, a secret police to take cyber drugs and weapons from the streets, as well as explore the induced technophobia to operate and investigate on a blank check permission) academy is placed under the command of Terrance Griffin and Dr. Kerr and linked to a SLD - an android - called Shinatama, who is neurally linked to her. However, Konoko knows next to nothing about her past, other that she was orphaned at the age of three and felt different to other people while was being brought up under the wing of TCTF. After many years in training, she has finally the chance to prove herself to Griffin and the TCTF, and so, heads for a warehouse rumoured to be under the control of the Syndicate, a criminal organization which grew exponentially after a young man called Boss Muro climbed to the top of the organization. Inspired by the classic Anime series Ghost in the Shell by Shirow Masamune, gameplay is a mix between generic third-person shooter and a classic beat&apos;em up. While Konoko has at her disposal several hand-to-hand acrobatic moves (with more unlocked as the player advances), she can also find weapons in the levels, and the decision to go armed or bare-fisted is only up to the player. Each weapon either draws from ballistic or energy cell clips, the number of rounds in each clip depending on the weapon- a Black Adder (a short, one-hand machine gun like an Uzi) can get 30 rounds from a ballistic clip, while a Mercury Bow (a sniper railgun sans scope) only two. Combined with the limited availability of clips, this adds a strategic element to the game, as the player can only carry a weapon at a time, so if a powerful weapons runs out of ammo, the player must choose between keeping the weapon and fight hand to hand with the enemies until Konoko finds fresh ammo clips, or discard it for a lesser gun that uses different ammo. However, if the player runs out of ammo completely when facing a tough challenge, Konoko can overdose on hypo sprays (used to heal damage) by using them over her natural health bar, which provides her with faster movement and tougher blows.</story>

Fourteen characters are available initially, but a total of twenty-four can be unlocked over the course of play, including long-time Capcom superstars Mega Man and Zero. With the addition of items and weapons strewn around the battle field which characters can pick up to aid in battle, gameplay is aptly compared to one of Capcom&apos;s other fighting franchises, Power Stone.</story>

Besides Soki, multiple characters can be played (5 in total), all with their different style of fighting. Soki uses swords, Jubei uses blades, and Ohatsu uses projectiles. The gameplay is faster paced and more of a real-time RPG feel. You can now lock on enemies instead of button mashing like the original games. Cooperative puzzles have been added to the series.

    <story>Onimusha- Warlords is set in 16th century Japan during the period of the civil war dominated by Nobunaga Oda. You play Samanosuke Akechi, who dies during an attempt to stop the kidnapping of young princess Yuki, the sister to Yoshitatsu Saito. However, Akechi is given another chance at life, and is handed the gauntlet of the Ogres. With this new power Samanosuke must fight through the monster-filled halls of Inabayama Castle. As monsters are defeated, their souls are absorbed by the gauntlet, increasing its power. Some souls restore Samanosuke&apos;s health and magic, while others can be used to power up weapons, armor, and items. Powering up weapons will increase their damage and the strength of their associated magic, and is also required to pass by special locks throughout the castle. Items will need to be found in one part of the castle to unlock doors or otherwise bypass obstacles elsewhere in the castle, and sometimes the player will take control of Samanosuke&apos;s companion Kaede while Samanosuke is incapacitated in some way. Kaede can reach some locations that are beyond Samanosuke as well as pick locks and throw kunai, but she can not absorb souls or open any lock intended for the wearer of the Ogre gauntlet.</story>

A young warrior, Jubei, returns home to find his remote and once vibrant village in ruins, destroyed by Nobunaga&apos;s minions. With vengeance in his heart, Jubei launches upon an epic and magical quest, which will reveal his ultimate destiny. Like Samanoske before him, Jubei can absorb the souls of defeated monsters to strengthen his weapons and armor. Monsters can be defeated either by attacking them until their health is depleted, or by striking them at the very instant before they hit Jubei. This will make Jubei preform an Issen attack which destroys in a single blow. Jubei can find or buy treasures in the first half of the game, and give these to companions he meets, befriending them. Based on who Jubei befriends the events of the game will change.</story>

    <story>In July 2001 it was discovered that an terrorist organization known as the The Solar Martyrs, hiding in a small country called Banhar, may have nuclear weapons at their disposal. The U.S. government decided that a large-scale attack would prove risky, and so a small group of Special Forces was formed... Only one machine is fit for such a task... In this simulator the player controls an AH-64 Apache, the primary attack helicopter in the U.S. Arsenal. It can be controlled from 5 different points of view, including 1st (inside the cockpit) and 3rd person ones. The on screen display holds valuable information to the pilot, such as damage meters, status of engines, rotor brakes, wheel brakes and hover, air speed, altitude, compass, radar, RPM, Torque, Fuel and more. The game features two control systems- arcade and physics mode. In arcade mode the helicopter maintains altitude while flying forward, while the physics mode is based on real world physics, thus, when the helicopter is moving forward, it will also lose altitude if the motor power isn&apos;t increased. The helicopter can be controlled either with a keyboard/mouse combo or with a joystick. The AH-64 comes equipped with 3 different types of weapons- Hellfire Missiles, m230 Chain Gun 30mm Automatic Cannon and Hydra Rockets. There is also a fourth kind of weapon, the Zuni Rockets, only available later in the game. Hellfire missiles are target lockable and the Cannon can be aimed with the mouse. There are 30 unique missions in this game; in most of them the player must accomplish several objectives, usually destroying enemy buildings and vehicles. The game can be saved at the end of each mission, but not during them. If the player gets killed during a mission, he must start it all over again, but the number of tries is unlimited.</story>

    <story>Apache Longbow Assault is a helicopter simulator for the AH-64 Apache Longbow variant and the follow-up to AH-64 Apache Air Assault. Similar to the previous game it is a mix of a simulation and arcade so players can start right away. The in-game cockpit then serves largely as a reference frame rather than complex manipulation by the player. The only game mode is a linear campaign that consists of about 30 missions. They take place during different times of day, weather and over varied terrain, including mountains, beaches and seas. It features head-to-head fights with other helicopters, attacking AA batteries, ships and ground vehicles, rescue operations and defense missions. Before starting the mission, a loadout can be defined as it is possible to run out of ammo. Weapons include Hydra rockets, Hellfire missiles and a M230 cannon. Optionally automatic targeting can be enabled. There is a night vision view and flares can be launched to assist the ground operations.</story>

    <story>Sometime in the 1960s, Cate Archer is the only female agent in the service of U.N.I.T.Y., a worldwide secret agency. Having been relegated to menial tasks over the years, Archer is finally given a chance to prove herself when a terrorist organization called H.A.R.M. starts to knock off active field agents. Under the qualification of being available as a trained agent, Cate is finally given the authority to track down and investigate these H.A.R.M. activities. In missions around the globe, Agent Archer will find herself sniping assassins, stealing documents, and doing a host of other suitably sneaky, but often deadly espionage tasks. No Ones Lives Forever is a 1st person shooter/sneaker that focuses on remaining undetected and obtaining intelligence data. Combining elements of James Bond (including Rare&apos;s Goldeneye 007 and Perfect Dark), Thief and Deus Ex, Cate will need use her weaponry and gadgets to get the drop on enemy agents. Among the gadgets available are photographic sunglasses, a lockpicking barrette, Body Remover (tm) powder, a cigarette lighter which can be used for wielding, lipstick explosives and a robotic poodle (for distracting guard dogs). Emphasizing sneakiness, the game not only gives extra points for not being seen, but also pulls tricks like alarms that cannot be shut off and guards that don&apos;t return to their docile ways once alerted to your presence. The AI does interesting things, such as knocking tables over and ducking for cover. But, at least on the lower difficulty levels, the game is willing to play with your aggressions and those who prefer shooting first and asking questions later can often gleefully blaze through the levels like a continuous action scene from a Bond flick. However while the mission will get completed, Agent Archer will relieve a lower score for taking the non-subtle approach. The game has the feel of the 1960&apos;s all over it and it shows through the artwork and the music, which are both very much in character with the period, from the loud outfits to the beatnik rythmn in the bars. In a homage to the old 60&apos;s spy movies and series, there are plenty of surprises, shootouts, close calls, memorable villains, and over-the-top action scenes.</story>

    <story>Orphen- Scion of Sorcery is the game based on the hit Japanese anime Sorcerous Stabber Orphen, (released outside of Japan as just Orphen). Orphen, his apprentice Majik, traveling partner Cleo and her pet dog/magical-wolf Leki, and the two mischievous trolls Volkan and Dorton, sail to the mysterious Chaos Island in search of wealth and riches. Also on the voyage are three strangers whose destinies pull Orphen and his companions into their mysterious journey. Only the powerful dark sorcerer Orphen, (in his trademark bemused manner), can discover what connections there are between the three strangers and the powers that rule the island, and keep himself and his companions alive long enough to find a way off of the ephemeral Chaos Island. Orphen- Scion of Sorcerery is a mix between adventure and some light RPG elements. Orphen is a dark sorcerer and attacks his enemies with various spells including a magical sword and elementals. The game is played in the third person perspective looking over Orphen&apos;s shoulder. You will run, jump, and explore your way through large levels on Chaos Island in varying environments; engage in boss battles that require you to use some puzzle solving and timing skills; and level up your dark magic. Once beaten, the game encourages replay by following branching story lines not taken in the previous play-through. The game maintains the feeling of the anime, particularly in the character designs and bantering dialogue. Orphen- Scion of Sorcery is entirely voice acted.</story>

    <story>Outlaw Volleyball- Remixed is a port of Outlaw Volleyball. It includes all the content of the Xbox version, plus two new courts and several extra costumes and accessories for the characters. Outlaw Volleyball- Remixed is an anarchic take on the sport with stereotypical characters like a Scottish Soccer Hooligan, a vain Latin lover and a British punk. Character&apos;s performance is determined partially by a momentum meter, which is filled by beating up members of the opposing team. The fighting segments play something like a simplified version of Tekken.</story>

    <story>Like its predecessors, OutRun 2006 is an old-school arcade racer, which means that your cars don&apos;t have realistic physics, don&apos;t get damaged and have insanely fast speed. Since this title is officially licensed by Ferrari, you drive with 15 original models from the DINO 246 GTS over the F430 to the all-new Enzo Ferrari. The heart of the game is the Coast 2 Coast mode in which you race against up to 5 AI players on 15 US themed tracks. In addition you have to impress different girlfriends. She tells you what she wants to see (a hard slide around a curve or a close take-over for example) and you have to perform it to win her heart. There are 3 other game modes available in singleplayer- OutRun, Time Attack and OutRun2SP. In OutRun2SP you get access to 15 arcade tracks from the original OutRun 2. In OutRun however you need to drive your girlfriend through various checkpoints to the goal before the timer hits zero. In Time Attack you just have to beat the highscore of the current track. You can either race against the clock or against ghost cars. In every mode you get OutRun miles after the race. These are the currency of the game and are needed to unlock new cars, upgrades and additional music-stations. If you feel alone, even with your virtual girlfriend in the car, you can race online against 5 other players.</story>

    <story>The fourth installment in Koei&apos;s P.T.O. series brings strategic naval combat to the PS2. There are two levels of play- global strategy and resource management are handled with a turn-based system on a world map while individual battles are fought using a real-time system on a much smaller scale. The campaign can be played as the Americans, British, Japanese, or Germans, starting either in September 1939 or December 1941. If a players chooses to be American or Japanese with a 1939 start date, they will sit on the sidelines and watch the war until December 1941, but they will still be able to gather resources and spend them to build units or develop technologies. Players can also concoct what-if scenarios by changing which countries belong to which powers- for example, one could play an Alliance of America and Germany against an Axis of Japan and Great Britain, or even play three-on-one for more of a challenge. The world map used in the turn-based grand strategy side of the game is broken down into territories connected in a web of lines indicating where fleets may pass from territory to territory. Game turns on this scale represent one month, and the time it takes a fleet to move from one territory to another correlates loosely to the length of the line connecting them. Players collect resources from the territories they control every turn. Resources include money, iron ore, aluminum, and oil. Money is used for construction of new units and facilities and to speed scientific development, iron is used in construction of ships, aluminum is used in construction of aircraft, and oil is consumed when fleets move. Technological advances are not purchased; instead players direct their scientists to focus on particular developmental paths, and breakthroughs come semi-randomly. The longer the scientists have been working on a particular problem, the more likely a breakthrough becomes. Giving the scientists extra money accelerates this process. In addition to the ship and aircraft types that become available automatically with scientific advancements, players can design their own custom types using whatever technology is available to them at the time. Players decide which types of ships and aircraft to build and how many. Ships are formed into fleets that can be moved about the world map while aircraft can be assigned to defend land-based airfields or assigned to fleets with ships capable of carrying aircraft. When two hostile fleets meet in the same territory, or when a hostile fleet enters a territory defended by land-based aircraft, a battle ensues. Battles are controlled in real-time with a 3-D isometric view. Players control entire fleets, not individual ships. Orders include sending a fleet to a particular point, ordering a fleet to attack a particular other fleet or airfield, and launching and recovering aircraft for CAP or to attack a particular fleet or airfield. Players can assign the computer to control as much or as little of strategy as desired. A player who enjoys the turn-based grand strategy but not the real-time battles can have the computer automatically resolve individual battles. Conversely, a player who enjoys the real time battles but not resource management can assign various aspects of resource management to the computer so that the player only has to decide where to move fleets. At the extreme, a player could even assign fleet movement to the computer and focus entirely on real-time combat. The game also offers a scenario mode that skips grand strategy entirely and throws the player into an individual battle.</story>

    <story>Pac-Man Fever takes place again! This time, Pac-Man is throwing a party, and has invited his other Namco friends to join in the activities. Players can choose for the six following characters- Pac-Man (from Pac-Man), Ms. Pac-Man (from Ms. Pac-Man), Heihachi Mishima (from Tekken), Tiger Jackson (from Tekken), Astaroth (from Soul Calibur), and Reiko (from Ridge Racer). Gameplay is similar to Nintendo&apos;s Mario Party, in which each player competes in a set of mini-games to advance around the board of three various worlds (Medieval, Space and Tropical). Players set the length of the game (short, medium, long), and play in rounds. Each round begins with a mini-game which determines how far a player can move on the board. Each tile on the board enables players to move forward or go backward, lose, gain, or steal tokens, play a single or two-player mini-game, spend earned tokens, or a raffle game to earn redemption tickets. With Store tiles, players can spend tokens to move forward, move other players backward, buy raffle tickets, or gamble for more tokens. Once a player reaches the end of the board, players receive redemption tickets based on how far they got on the board. These can be used to buy each mini-game separately for tournament play outside the game. Once all the mini-games have been purchased, players can add up all of their tickets to total up their overall high score.</story>

    <story>This action-orientated game takes you through 18 missions taking place throughout the WWII. Six Missions per side (Americans, Russians and Germans) place you inside a tank from the corresponding period (for example, in the first mission of the game you drive the famous German Panzer II Ausf. C). Your tank is equipped with a cannon with limited ammo and a MG with unlimited ammo. With this arsenal you now have to complete different objectives (which can change throughout the mission) inside the missions like blowing up a fuel depot. In this process you also destroy and blow up many other things in the almost completely destroyable environment (from trees to houses) and of course you&apos;ve to fight against enemy infantry and tanks. The game also gives you command over a squad of friendly tanks which you can give simple but effective commands like &apos;make a flank attack on that position&apos; or &apos;go and repair yourself at this repairstation&apos;. The mission-briefing consists of original WWII film footage where a speaker explains different aspects of the tank-war and a text (read to you) in which the story of your tank-crew is explained.</story>

    <story>Paparazzi is a game where you take the role of a photographer who is after great shots of famous models. Unlike your typical paparazzi, you don&apos;t get to hide in bushes and take photos of women in compromising positions - instead, you go to preset photo shoots, and try to take the best shots of the subject using your rolls of film. You have a choice of three different models to take photographs of- Riho (a sporty girl), Lena (a supermodel), and Nano (an Internet idol). Initially, you have a basic camera, but as you take better photographs, you can earn more money to upgrade its functionality. New lenses, such as telephoto and wide angle lenses can be used, and a tripod can be purchased to stop your shaky hands. To get models to perform poses for you and to look at you, you can also perform an appeal. You can dance, jump, call out, or wave your hands - each appeal has a different mini-game associated with it. If you perform the same appeal multiple times in a row, your subject will lose interest, so it&apos;s important to vary your actions. The more success you have with appeals, the more interesting and unique poses you can get your model to perform (which are worth more points in the photo shoot).</story>

Once at a high level, there is further specialization with 7 advanced classes. The character&apos;s customization includes the clothes, hair, facial features, voice, and body proportions. The game takes place in the Gurhal Star System, with three planets to explore. Players can also team up in squad-based combat and tackle over twenty massive dungeons. The movement options of the previous game have been improved, with enhancements such as strafing. Characters can wield different weapons for each hand and there are player-controlled vehicles.

    <story>Phantom Brave is a strategy RPG which takes place in the world of Ivoire. Ivoire consists of vast seas and numerous islands; it used to be a peaceful place, but an ancient (and powerful) force is now threatening life in the various lands. The character you control in the game is Marona, a 13 year old orphaned girl. Marona has the ability to communicate with phantoms, an ability that brings a lot of resentment from other people but will help her to head out into the world and solve the problems that are occurring. A phantom known as Ash acts as Marona&apos;s guardian; as the game progresses, other phantoms will join your party, each of which have different capabilities. The game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a phantom to will affect it&apos;s abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower. By defeating enemies in battle you earn experience points allowing to level up and become more powerful. The games story takes place in 20 episodes. Each episode features a unique goal to be completed before moving on. Between episodes you can visit your home on Phantom Island; here you can summon additional phantoms to join your party. Initially only a few types of phantoms can be summoned, but more become available as experience is gained. You may also replay already completed episodes or enter a random dungeon in order to level up your party and earn additional money to buy items.</story>

    <story>Piglet is Christopher Robin&apos;s shy and squeamish friend in the children&apos;s Winnie the Pooh stories. Also loosely based on Piglet&apos;s Big Movie, this version of Piglet&apos;s Big Game has a different story and objectives than the PC/Mac version released separately. Each character is voiced by the original actors from the movie. This is a single player adventure game with action elements. In the Hundred-Acre-Wood, Pooh, Eeyore, Roo, Owl, Rabbit and Tigger are going about their normal activities when Piglet sees a scary Granosorus, which disappears before anyone else can see it. When Piglet tries to warn his friends, they don&apos;t believe him. Christopher Robin tells Piglet to overcome his fears, but Piglet thinks that he will never be big and brave enough. As his friends start to fall asleep, Piglet leaves the woods and finds a magical telescope which allows him to jump into the dreams his friends are having during their naps. In each of the 6 dream levels, Piglet must help his friends with problems and puzzles. For example, help Pooh find honey or Tigger find his stripes. Each dreamworld is also dangerous with menacing Heffalumps and Woozles, among other scary monsters. Piglet must defeat these monsters with a tactic he knows well - making scary faces. Some monsters aren&apos;t frightened enough, though, so use cookies (hidden in the scenery) to buy some scarier ones at the Brave Face Factory. Find and use Christopher Robin&apos;s balloon which gives Piglet a morale boost and a burst of speed. Depending upon the scenario, three characters can be controlled- Piglet, Tigger and Winnie the Pooh. After the 6 nightmare levels are solved, Piglet will face the real Granosorus from the beginning of the game and become a hero by rescuing his friends.</story>

    <story>Over 180,000 Allied airmen were shot down on enemy territory during WW2. This game is about one of those men, trying to get to safety of Switzerland through hostile territory. The gameplay is mostly about sneaking around varied environments such as a lumberyard, wilderness and so forth trying not to be detected by the German troops and making as little commotion as possible. With the aid of different objects (such as cigarette packs for distracting guards or apples for a quick stamina replenishing) the player must make it through the levels. The player character has a stamina which means that it&apos;s not very good idea to be standing in a freezing cold water for too long because if the stamina meter runs out, the health meter starts to deplete. Because of it, it&apos;s a good idea to warm up by campfires or eat something once in a while, thus restoring stamina. Of course there is some weapons also, which one can use to dispatch enemies that wander too close. They range from a piano string to machine pistols.</story>

This is done by modifying it with things like adding nitrous, new rims, tinted windows and vinyls externally and adding things like new seats, T.V sets, music players and games consoles inside. You start with the host of the show, Xzibit, lending you his car, and you must go out into in a five borough area called &apos;Pimp City&apos;. At this point, you can take part in various mini games throughout Pimp City in order to earn money and buy your own car, and then pimp it. While pimping your ride, Pimp My Ride&apos;s host Xzibit will be on hand to help you. Once you have completed your car&apos;s pimping out, you can take your new looking ride out for a spin into Pimp City, essentially turning the game into a free roaming racer, and earn money and complete various challenges and races in order to progress through the game.</story>

The 3rd-person gameplay is similar to the modern Prince of Persia games. Francis Blade uses his sword, gun, and magic to fight enemies in a Caribbean setting. There are also a lot of environment-based puzzles with acrobatic moves. The area has been divided into 18 major sections, not all of them available right away. Blade needs to collect new powers for his Black Buccaneer form, and can for instance take control of enemies or summon minions.

    <story>Based on the second and third movies of the popular Pirates of the Caribbean series, players step into the roles of Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, as they continue their adventures on the high seas. The game is set up as a 3D action-adventure in a free-roaming world that allows players to explores the islands and seas of the Caribbean. Players will have to face off again Davy Jones, his Flying Dutchman crew and the villainous kraken in addition to the Chinese pirate Sao Feng, cannibals, other pirates, and the East India Trading Company. Players must battle their way through the events of Dead Man&apos;s Chest and At World&apos;s End using a variety of sword and item attacks, in addition to a system called Black Pearls, which only allows players to block for so long until the Black Pearls are drained and no longer able to block until it recharges. Each character has their own special attack, and other weapons, such as pistols and daggers, can be found for use in combat. While all console versions of this titles are the same in format, presentation, and developer, the Playstation 3 version makes use of the Six-Axis controller for navigation through various areas in the game, and the Wii version makes use of the Wiimote for motion based attacks. The Wii version also makes use of interactive scripted sequences called Jackanisms, which allow players to handle themselves through certain events in a manner that Captain Jack Sparrow would.</story>

    <story>Colorful Captain Jack Sparrow weaves a tale tall as only he is capable, retelling events fans have come love, and adding new and even more far fetched adventures. Accompanying Captain Jack on his journey of fancy are the young Will Turner and his bride to be Elizabeth Swann. Gameplay flows much like other third-person action-adventures such as God of War, The Lord of the Rings- The Two Towers, or Demon Stone. Players can fight alone, or team up with a friend to conquer the fast paced, swashbuckling, hack and slash romp through a myriad of interactive and exotic locations. A full player-controlled upgrade system, along with a diverse set of sword fighting and grappling moves, gives players many ways in which to dispatch their foes. To spice it all up, many challenging puzzles in the form of mini-games can be found throughout the game&apos;s 20+ rich and lively levels.</story>

The stealth missions are often followed by gun fight missions where the action is much more intensive. The player usually has to protect one of the characters while he&apos;s doing an action and kill the opponents with the others.</story>

More money means a larger staff, and more items (toys and furniture) for Hef to display in the Mansion. Doing well in the game earns Hef points which can be used to purchase extra features, such as cheats and archive photos of Hef and past issue covers.</story>

The action begins in Los Angeles&apos; Little Tokyo district where the elusive Gokudo-Kai organized crime family is suspected of illegal weapons smuggling. As a police officer looking for the opportunity to rise in rank, players embark on a special assignment to apprehend the Gokudo-Kai members and crack down on criminal activity. Police 24/7 features remarkable USB motion sensor technology, requiring players to move their entire bodies to perform realistic manoeuvres such as dodging bullets, peering around corners and laying low to take cover. A compatible USB camera is required for the motion-sensor--Konami recommend an Omnivision camera--but the game&apos;s playable with just a light gun or in fact even a standard controller. The fast-paced action intensifies as players fight a crime ring that spans from Los Angeles to the bustling Japanese city of Shinjuku. Players progress throughout the game to earn performance-based points, which will eventually lead to the coveted title of Commissioner. </story>

    <story>Pool-shark 2 is a simulation of the pool sport. Its most unique aspect is its setting- instead of high class tournaments, the player find himself in smoky pubs with opponents like truck-drivers and lightly clad biker women. The handling, however, is similar to other pool games. The player has a lot of opportunities to tweak the position of the cue. A analog stick or mouse movement simulates the shot. The game features ten pool variants, including popular ones like Eight-Ball and trick shots or exotic ones like snowboat pool. When playing the career mode (called Hustler), the player can bet money. The winnings are reinvested in clothes or pieces of equipment which look different but have no bearings on gameplay. Every successful match unlocks the next of overall 20 opponents.</story>

A light rain sprinkles the ground as a large figure jumps across the roof tops, landing with the massive thumps of a large inhuman creature. The Predator has been wounded and now seeks to return to his ship before the humans find him and kill him. Thus is the opening for Predator- Concrete Jungle. The game begins in 1930 and moves on to the year 2030 as the player controls a Predator from a third-person view in expansive levels. The Predator&apos;s arsenal includes a staff, maul, glaive, explosive mines, spear gun, and a set of claws that appear from the forearm. With those weapons the player is able to skin, slice, stab, crush, and mangle the many enemies in the game, ultimately hunting the alpha male whose skull would make a worthy prize.</story>

    <story>Premier Manager 08 is a soccer manager where the player is responsibly for the athletic and financial success of his team. As usual there are a lot of details to take care of, e.g. searching for sponsors, stadium expansion, player transfers, lineup and tactics. But, as usual for English soccer managers, the emphasis is on the athletic aspect. The player character earns experience depending on his successes and unlocks new abilities with it, e.g. to construct a certain building. The same goes for the staff members. The second innovation is a new bar where the player has quick access to his staff members who keep him up to date - this replaces the usual news systems. The matches itself use an abstract presentation- The soccer field is shown in a top-down, tactical perspective and the player movements are shown with blue and yellow balls. The game features about 400 teams in six leagues.</story>

    <story>The story of Prince of Persia- The Sands of Time starts with the Prince and his father, the King of Persia, besieging the Maharajah&apos;s castle to plunder the treasures hidden inside. In order to impress his father, the Prince sneaks inside to recover the magical Dagger of Time. He quickly learns that this dagger has the ability to control time. The malevolent Vizier has other plans for the dagger, however, and tricks the Prince into unlocking a mysterious secret of the Dagger that causes the King and many of his subjects to be turned into sand zombies. Now, the Prince must figure out what has happened and try to set things right again. Prince of Persia- The Sands of Time is an action adventure game that updates many of the gameplay concepts from the original two games and brings them into a fully 3-dimensional world. The Prince will engage in sword fighting, wall climbing, spike dodging, puzzle solving, and more in his quest. The Prince also carries the Dagger of Time, which allows him to unleash several magical powers. The most important of these powers is the ability to reverse time. This ability allows the player to reverse their actions when they lead the Prince to his death.</story>

    <story>After many dangerous adventures, the Prince finally makes his way home to Babylon, bringing with him his new bride Kaileena, the Empress of Time. Their hopes for a peaceful and happy future together are dashed, however, when they arrive in Persia to find the land ravaged by war. Kaileena is promptly captured and murdered by the evil Vizier, and her death unleashes the Sands of Time, from which the Vizier derives terrifying new powers. Once again the Prince of Persia must stand to fight, but this time he will be stronger than ever, thanks to his new alter ego the Dark Prince, borne of the Prince&apos;s contact with the Sands. As he fights to reclaim his kingdom from the hands of a madman, he must also battle with his own inner demons as the Dark Prince threatens to consume him entirely. The game is very similar (in terms of fight and puzzle sequences) to the previous installments of UbiSoft&apos;s Prince of Persia trilogy- The Sands of Time and Warrior Within. There are some major innovations like the character of Dark Prince, who possess the main protagonist from time to time and offers him new combos and moves. There is also new ability, called Speed Kill, which is very effective against all opponents in the game (victims are attacked from behind and murdered in brutally fashion). In Prince of Persia- The Two Thrones player will explore not only the streets of Babylon, but also a ruined palace of his father, temple and the famous Hanging Gardens.</story>

    <story>Prince of Persia- Warrior Within is the direct sequel to Prince of Persia- The Sands of Time. The game comes with a new, darker look for the Prince and his surroundings. The fights are more brutal and take a larger part in the game, as the Prince now has enhanced fighting moves including new attack moves via walls and poles. Even though the fights make up a large part of the game, the puzzle sections are still present and more complicated than before. A new move in the puzzle sections of the game is the curtain slide, which allows you to slide down to the ground slowly. There are still plenty of options for time manipulation and the storyline also lets you travel back and forth in time, visiting the same locations in an alternate time period.</story>

    <story>It is World War II, and the player takes the role of an American pilot, Captain Lewis Stone, who is thrown into a prison camp of the Nazis. While attempting to escape the camp, Captain Stone discovers that the Germans are developing a secret weapon they intend to use against the Allies. Soon his personal wish of escape turns into a desire to save the world from the destruction the Nazis are planning. Prisoner of War can be described as a stealth game. Unlike most other games of its kind (e.g. the Thief series), the game relies on stealth entirely, without offering violent options. The protagonist is helpless in the prison camp, and his only weapon is his wit. Sneaking past guards to deliver an important object to a fellow prisoner, hiding items, staying in shadows to avoid being recognized, and other stealth-based activities occupy the largest portion of the game. </story>

    <story>PBR- Out of the Chute gives players the opportunity to experience PBR (Professional Bull Riders) either through the eyes of the riders themselves or even the bulls (24 total, 12 of each), each with their own strengths and weaknesses as well as signature moves. The goal for the riders is to stay on for a full eight seconds while the bull&apos;s is to buck off the rider as fast as possible. The list of riders and bulls are- Bull Riders 1. Brian Canter 2. Ross Coleman 3. J.W. Hart 4. Mike Lee 5. Guilherme Marchi 6. Justin McBride 7. Adriano Moraes 8. Ty Murray 9. Wiley Peterson 10. Chris Shivers 11. Mike White 12. Sean Willingham Bulls 1. Big Bucks 13. Cat Daddy 14. Chicken on a Chain 15. Dr. Proctor 16. Just a Dream 17. Little Yellow Jacket 18. Okeechobee Spots 19. Reindeer Dippin 20. Shane 21. Versus Blackout 22. Vertical Limit 23. White Magic The modes consists of a quick ride as either a rider or a bull or a tutorial that the player can learn the controls of the two. There is also an unlimited mode where players can battle a bull without the eight second rule and see how long they can stay on. There is also a season mode where the player can either use a rider or a bull in a ten city schedule (Dallas, Anaheim, Atlanta, Uncasville, Albuquerque, Tacoma, New York, New Orleans, Tulsa and Las Vegas) in an attempt to win the championship or the award for Bull of the Year with each event lasting three rounds. The controls consist of using the the Left Analog stick for the rider and the bull, either to lean in a certain direction to keep from being thrown or for the bull, to buck and spin in an attempt to throw off the rider with the Right Analog stick only used to run in any direction for the bull. The shoulder buttons are also used, the L1 and R1 is used for the rider to tighten their grip on the bull to keep from being thrown off, however these are only present in the medium and hard modes. Likewise, the L2 and R2 are used for both the bull and rider and for their signature modes. The X button is also used for the rider to dismount the bull, hitting it again while in air to land on their feet will give the player bonus points, also the X button can also be used during the ride to spur on the bull, resulting in bonus points as well. Additionally, the bull can receive bonus points by breaking cameras and signs scattered around the side of the pen. There are two different meters with the same purpose, the rider has a health meter which can be lowered, the lower it is the more likely the player will be thrown off. Additionally, if a rider is injured in a ride, their health will be depleted slightly for the next round. A rage meter is used for the bull, the higher the meter the more likely they can buck off a rider, but the lower it is the more the rider has a chance to complete the ride. There are also power-ups that can be obtained through the season mode (however only in the medium and hard difficulty levels) that are obtained for scoring a certain sets of points for a round. For the rider a spur is obtained and can be used to slow down the bull while the bull receives a set of horns that speeds up the bull and increases the chances of throwing off a rider. These power-ups are activated by pressing and holding the Down button on the D-pad for a second. There is also multiplayer capabilities where two friends can battle head-to-head, one as the rider and the other as the bull. Players can also unlock videos of actual PBR action by completing certain objectives throughout the game.</story>

    <story>Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 is a simulation of the soccer sport. The player can choose between numerous (partly licensed) teams and use the usual playing modes, e.g. training, cup championships or the Master League with a few additional managerial components. The main differences to Pro Evolution Soccer 2007 are a new adaptive AI for the Master League and a new animation system. This version of the game has numerous differences to the NextGen version- It lacks the ability to perform dives and to change the player wall during free kicks. In return there are a few additional features- more stadiums (33 instead of 12), matches with random players, a more extensive training mode, the World Tour mode (about 100 challenges where the player has to solve certain goals in pre-defined situations, e.g. scoring a goal in a limited time) and unique community features, e.g. a friends list or private tournaments. The latter - along with all savegames - are compatible to both the PSP and PS2 version.</story>

    <story>Konami has announced that Liverpool FC and Spanish international striker Fernando Torres is to join Lionel Messi as the cover stars of PES 2010! Torres, 25, has enjoyed an incredibly successful season both at club and international level, and will now join UEFA Champions League winner Messi on the front of PES 2010&apos;s packaging. Pro Evolution Soccer 2010 Game •Enhanced Realism- PES 2010 delivers a pace of game in tune with football played at the highest level. Triangulation of passes and use of off-the-ball runs are key to breaking down the opposition, forcing the player to use the strengths of their team mates to create scoring opportunities. Gone are &apos;soft&apos; goals that can be used to break the deadlock - instead, only working the channels and the precision play expected of great players will make a difference. •Player Characteristics- Key skills of the many players have now been attributed named, allowing users to incorporate them into their play strategy. Cover star Torres, for instance, is renowned for his ability to receive a pass in the penalty area, and to drop the ball to a teammate in a good position for a goal-scoring opportunity. As such, he is labeled a Fox In The Box and Goal Poacher, in line with his prowess in both scoring and setting up goals. •Instant Tactical Switching- Each team has unique settings matching their real-life playing styles.

    <story>Total Control- PES Productions has enhanced the 360-degree passing ratio, offering unprecedented levels of control over every pass, shot, throw-in, through ball and lofted through balls. This allows users to pass the ball into space, and move their play with total freedom. Players must precisely weight their passes and second-guess the runs of their team-mates and exploit their movement. Players even can apply pressure on opponents to force them off the ball. •Shot &amp; Stamina Gauge- In addition to the generic power gauge, the Shot &amp; Stamina meter details the player&apos;s exact level of fitness. Constantly sprinting will affect the player&apos;s movements and will have an adverse affect on his stats, with passes going awry and a loss of pace. •New Defender AI- Defenders now hold their positions naturally, no longer chasing any ball that enters their area - preferring to close down the attacker and force them into a mistake. •Animation and Player Physics- PES Productions has totally reworked every element of in-game animation. These additions will become clear before even kick-off, with the players enjoying fluid, natural movements, with more realistic acceleration and inertia than ever before. The physicality between players is also improved, which was a priority requested in PES forums. Jostling and blocking now looks stunning, while there is a larger variety of convincing tackling styles. Ambient animation also adds immensely to the in-game atmosphere, as players behave realistically when off the ball, and walk and run with a variety of individual styles. •Speed of Play- The new level of control means that PES 2011 enjoys a more considered pace of play, which varies dependent on situations. The game will burst into life as counter-attacks come into play, but players can dictate the pace via slow build up or exploiting available space to surge forward. It is harder to make long </story>

    <story>PES 2012 continues KONAMI’s determination to listen to its fanbase and make key improvements to the aspects the audience demands. Thus, the focus for PES 2012 is to ensure the highest level of playability, challenge and realism for the game, whilst also improving the level of control offered to users. Fundamental changes to all areas of its AI have been made following user feedback. Similarly, teamwork is central to how the game moves and feels, enabling fans to replicate anything they would see in a real match.Active AI- PES 2012 strives to recreate the movement and team ethic of real football, and Active AI plays a vital role in this. Players will no longer flock to a ball, but will make intelligent runs to create space and draw markers, while others will make themselves available, instigate runs, and visibly call for the ball. In the box, support players will make diagonal decoy runs, full backs will overlap on the wings and midfielders will provide support from behind the ball. The new Active AI routines ensure the flow of a match is more natural, with specific routines for both attack and defence. Hold-up play implemented last year has been improved for easier control with more effectiveness. Defending as a unit plays a key role, and players now hold a tight line, check on the distance between each other, track back as a unit, and fill in for each other. As individuals they also make better decisions to close space, block and tackle. Jostling- Physicality is a key component in PES 2012, with player strength one of their key individual attributes, and having a vital effect on how they can use their strength to win the ball in a one-on-one situation. Players now fall depending on how they are challenged, with more realistic animations used to show the challenges between two jostling players. Graphics- Several aspects of the game have enjoyed a huge overhaul. Player facial expression is now much richer and the lighting effects are more natural, while new cameras show off the huge variety of pitch-side movement, with more detail on and around the game than ever before. Off The Ball Control- Equally key to opening up PES 2012 is the ability to highlight any player at any time. A new system has been implemented, allowing users to switch players with ease. In defence, the right stick is now used to select any outfield player, while set pieces are also enhanced through its use. Goal kicks, corners, free kicks and throw-ins now let the user quickly take control of any player off the ball, enabling clever runs which create space for an attack. Referee AI- Referees are also crucial to general game flow and their AI has been greatly enhanced to ensure fewer interruptions to play. Decisions are improved, and advantage is played much more regularly in offside and free kick scenarios. As such, refs will only intervene when truly necessary, but they will show cards if necessary once play has broken down. Pass Support- Accessed through the new personal player settings, Pass Support allows users to determine the level of AI assistance when passing the ball. Players can opt for one of five settings from full support, right up to full veteran setting which switches off all assistance so that the direction, weight and speed of every pass is at their disposal </story>

    <story>Working from the ground up, PES Productions have strived to rework every element of play, creating a fresh and energetic new standard for football titles. In addition to noticeably improved graphics and seamless animation, the thrust of the new system&apos;s power has been used to redefine the way football is played on a home system. Gone are the limitations imposed by dated animation systems and AI elements, and instead PES 2014 boasts a central core that perfectly mimics the skill and awareness that elevates the world&apos;s greatest players above their peers.;Six central tenets combine to establish PES 2014 as a new benchmark in football simulations, governing everything from the way the player receives and controls the ball, the physicality of play, and the &apos;feel&apos; of match-day- the rush and euphoria or crushing lows that experiencing an important games can bring. As such, the key pillars on which PES 2014 is based are-;True B all Tech- For the first time in a football simulation, PES 2014 centres everything on the ball- how it moves, and how players use it. First touch and sublime control are what set certain players apart from others. The ability to not only read a pass, but to be one step ahead and to know what is needed to gain yards on an encroaching defender. TrueBall Tech allows the player to trap or knock on a pass using the analogue stick with detailed barycentric physics determining the weight shift of the player and the height and speed of the pass, as to how the player&apos;s body will automatically shape to receive it.;Thus, the player has total control in determining how their body is angled to receive a pass, whereas previous football titles present the user with scant options. Instead, TrueBall Tech means that it can be chested or nodded past an opponent, flicked into space or to a team mate, while closer dribbling control is a much more personal attribute in the new game. </story>

    <story>ProStroke Golf- World Tour 2007 is a golf simulation which unique feature is the innovative control scheme. In contrast to other golf simulations the tee is performed in first person mode. After choosing the club and the feet position the player needs to use both analog sticks. With the left one he simulates the swing and with the right one he relocates his body weight. It is not enough to relocate it simply in the right direction, the player needs to achieve a constant back and forth movement. This only works when using a gamepad, alternatively there is also a more traditional three-click control scheme in 3rd person. There the player chooses the body weight movement before the strike. With the first click he strikes out, with the second one he determines the precision and with the last one the strength. This, however, is still different to other golf simulations because the kind of swing is not chosen beforehand but determined by the swing parameters. Less innovative are the playing modes. The game features the usual training, single tournament and career mode. The career mode however are just many tournaments tacked together. The player character improves his rank with successes but this just influences the conditions of participation for other tournaments and not the gameplay itself. The game features nine licensed golfers, 18 courses (two licensed) and three real-life golf-commentators. With the editor the player can build own courses and tournaments.</story>

Unfortunately an epidemic infests all kingdoms except the one inhabited by the unicorns. Of course this leads to accusations and the unicorn Pryzm is sent out to end the plague - she is accompanied by the troll magician Karrock who distrusts her. The player takes control over both of them at the same time- the left analogue stick controls the unicorn and the right one the troll. The basic gameplay is simple- the player rides through the 16 levels and battles infected flora and fauna. After defeat they transform back to their real selves - if the whole level (including the periodic mini bosses) is rescued the player can proceed to the next one. The roles of the heroes are evenly divided- Pryzm is used for moving at different speeds, jumping and defensive spells, e.g. stun. Karrock on the other hand uses offensive spells and his magic wand to hit the enemies nearby. The game can be played in first or third person perspective.</story>

Unfortunately a recent super nova has caused the AI to go out of control, and threatens to use the same weapons and defensive capabilities that kept humanity alive in outer space to completely destroy them. You star as a lone pilot who must fly his mecha deep into the core of GUIS and destroy it before its too late, shooting your way through several enemy-infested stages (6 in the original, 8 in the arranged version) with the next stage being decided by the rank you get in the previous one. The game doesn&apos;t feature much in the way of power-ups or upgradeable weapons, but instead features the unique Buzz system, which increases your rate of fire and power in relation to horizontal rolling and movement, encouraging the player to move all over the screen. Also, your mecha has a unique power-bar that can only be filled by buzzing enemy bullets, which involves getting close to said bullets so that they scrape the edges of your mecha and charge it up. When max power is reached you can become invulnerable for a short time, which you can use to continue buzzing and extend your invulnerability to survive the intricate attack patterns. The game uses polygonal graphics and features both the original arcade Psyvariar Medium Unit and a Revision mode, which upgrades the graphics and adds a few stages.</story>

The general gameplay has the player watching a music video as symbols scroll by. The player must match the symbols on the screen with the symbols on the Pump It Up dance pad with their feet. Hitting the arrows in sync with the music will keep the players life bar up and give the player a good rating, while doing the opposite will drain the life bar and give bad ratings. If the life bar drains all the way, the game ends. The game has several mode to choose from- •Arcade Mode has the player trying to achieve an “A” or an “S” rating on three consecutive songs. Doing that allows the player to play an extra song. Successfully completing songs in the Arcade mode opens them for play in Home Mode. •Home Mode allows the player to choose any song they have available to them. •Sudden Death Mode forces the player to perform a song flawlessly or the game ends. •Survival Mode - This mode becomes available after the player completes twenty songs in the Home Mode.

A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by is the combining four or more of the same color which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto you opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos. When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen you can try to offset by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to you opponent. When any players field becomes so full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game. Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.</story>

    <story>As a citizen of the kingdom of Bartonia, it&apos;s your job to discover why the Undead have begun swarming all over the world of Etheria. In this RPG hybrid you&apos;ll be following the story of your character as they rid Etheria of the Undead scourge and save Bartonia, complete sidequests for extra money, experience, items and companions, craft your own weapons and armor, capture monsters for use as mounts or to learn their spells, and even lay siege to neighboring kingdoms in order to add them to your own empire. However, Puzzle Quest is an RPG with a twist. Everything is done (as the name implies) with puzzles. Everything in Puzzle Quest is done with puzzles. The puzzles themselves are similar to Bejeweled in execution, with a few slight variations used for things like item crafting and enemy capture. When fighting an enemy (which can range from zombies to orcs and even castle strongholds, each with their own special spells and abilities), you both take turns using the same board. The goal is to reduce your opponents hitpoints to zero, which can be done directly by linking up skulls in rows of three or more, or by using spells which require mana. To build up mana, just link three or more runes of the same color together, just like the skulls. Every time you gain mana, it&apos;s stored in your reserves until you use it (or are hit with a mana draining attack). Gold and experience are built up in the same way, using gold coins or purple experience orbs that occupy the same board and can be linked just like runes and skulls. The real strategy behind the game comes into play when you factor in elemental mastery (gaining extra mana when linking runes for a specific element), equipment (which can prevent damage, drain mana and more), spells (which can poison, drain mana, stun and so on) and linking up groups of four or more. The reason groups of four are important is that every time a row of four-of-a-kind is created, you get an extra turn. While it doesn&apos;t sound important, getting four runes in a row could possibly give you enough mana to cast an extremely powerful spell and give you the extra turn to cast it before your enemy can even move. There is also a direct action mode in which players can hone their skills against various opponents independent from the story mode, as well as wireless multi-card play where two players can square off using their own characters from the campaign mode.</story>

    <story>Young Jack Russell wants to follow in the footsteps of his father, a renowned member of the Royal Radiata Knights who protect the kingdom. Unfortunately, Jack is more than a little in need of some refining. He&apos;s a bad boy with a sharp tongue and a penchant for kicking objects and even people around. Can a world-saving quest help this obnoxious 16-year-old grow into a respectable human being? Radiata Stories is a lighthearted and humorous fantasy role-playing game from Square Enix. You control Jack as he travels from town to town, recruiting allies and taking on menial tasks. Of course there&apos;s also a plot of saving the kingdom from certain doom, but there&apos;s plenty of time for exploring and meeting people before you&apos;ll need to worry about that. The game is fairly open-ended, allowing players to explore at their leisure. Unlike the usual RPG, where the NPC characters simply wait around for the player to come listen to their one sentence, everyone in Radiata Stories has their own life. People wake up, go places and do things, then go back home. Learning the characters&apos; schedules and using them to Jack&apos;s advantage is critical to a successful adventure. Sometimes they&apos;re too busy to stop and talk to you, so you have to catch them at the right time. This makes Radiata feel less like a game and more of a living, breathing world. Combat is real-time, much like Star Ocean- Till the End of Time and Namco&apos;s Tales series, but you can give general guidelines for the NPC party members on how they should operate. There&apos;s even a link system that lets you coordinate your party&apos;s strategy. There are two main story paths through the game, and after you&apos;ve completed one you get to keep all your money and skills the second time around. A minimum of two play-throughs are required to discover and recruit the game&apos;s 177 potential party members. (Shades of the Suikoden series by Konami.) Once you&apos;ve recruited people as friends, you can swap your current party members at any time, but the only character you ever control yourself is Jack- if his HP falls to 0, your adventure is over.</story>

Once again you control the Raiden Fighting Thunder ME-02 trying to fend off the attack of the alien invaders. There are in total 7 levels, the first three set on Earth and the last three in space. This is a vertically scrolling shoot &apos;em-up which (as many other vertically scrolling shooters do) offers the option to either play the game in yoko or tate screen flipping modes depending on whether your tv is placed on its side or not. Technique In arcades, it was the first game to use the Taito Type X arcade system-board. It implements a 3D scrolling system permitting the scenery to move in three dimensions- climbing, descending, vertically moving. Weapons Main weapons Yellow Vulcan Shot Spread weapon - shoots streams of 2/4 projectiles in 3/5/7 directions. Green Proton Laser Replaces the characteristic toothpaste plasma laser of the Raiden series. Blue Laser (new to the series) A continuous forward-facing blue laser, lateral ship movement makes it swerve slightly. Secondary Weapons Nuclear Missile (M power-up) Dumb-fire missiles that spread out laterally then accelerate forward. In addition to direct hits, the explosions cause damage as well. Homing Missile (H power-up) Homing missiles that target the closest enemy around the player; weak damage, but it protects the ship on its flanks. Radar Missile (R power-up) A partially guided missile; the missiles drift laterally until they align with enemies and charge forward. The radar missiles&apos; explosions cause damage as well. Smart bomb A ball of flame spreads out around the ship. The bomb stock can be increased with bomb power-ups (B on a spinning triangle). The ship can carry up to 7 bombs.</story>

    <story>Scum Labs is testing a new drink called &apos;Scum Soda&apos;. However, all thirty test subjects that drank it have transformed into angry, hulking monsters! Most of the monsters have been contained in cryo-tubes and hidden within various cities. However, some monsters, such as George, Lizzie and Ralph, are still free! It&apos;s up to you to tear down cities and find the hidden monsters. Rampage- Total Destruction is an update to the arcade game Rampage. In it, you play as one of thirty furious monsters as you make your way through cities, destroying buildings and eating people for health. Destroying buildings builds up your Rampage Meter - when this is full, you&apos;ll become super-powered for a while, and be able to destroy things much more quickly. Each level also has a bonus challenge - such as &apos;Eat ten mimes&apos; or &apos;Destroy five trams&apos;. If you complete this challenge, your monster will receive a permanent upgrade, such as a roar attack, or a charge punch. At the tenth level of each city, players face off against a boss character, Dr. Vector - if you destroy his dangerous machines as well as levelling the city, you&apos;ll receive a bonus. A new feature of Rampage- Total Destruction is the ability to climb on the front of buildings. Instead of just climbing the sides and standing on the top of buildings, players can now smash the buildings from the front as well. However, there is an added danger to this - people now hurl objects like televisions out their windows in an attempt to try and stop you. The game also includes two previous games from the series as a bonus - the original Rampage, and Rampage World Tour. These games are emulations of the arcade versions of the game.</story>

    <story>Ratchet- Deadlocked is the fourth game in the Ratchet &amp; Clank series by Insomniac Games. Deadlocked is different in its counterparts in that it focuses more on shooting than platforming and puzzle elements. The game allows you to use two bots to fight along side you, which can be upgraded over time with better weapons and firepower. The storyline involves Ratchet and Clank, along with Al, being kidnapped and forced to compete in a underground reality show called DreadZone run by the media mogul Gleeman Vox on the outer fringes of the galaxy. There are 10 total weapons in the game, significantly less than the other games. However, modding these weapons is more emphasized than before, with different kinds of Alpha and Omega mods. Omega mods can be used on any weapon, and range from the freeze mod to the magma mod. Alpha mods are weapon-specific, and increase the rate of fire, ammo capacity, and power. The game also features online multiplayer. Clank is not a playable character in this game, although he gives advice to Ratchet over his communication link.</story>

    <story>Ratchet &amp; Clank- Size Matters is the first game in the Ratchet &amp; Clank franchise to appear on the PSP and it does not stray away from from the console versions. In this 3D action platformer, the duo gets lured into a mysterious quest and soon rediscovers a forgotten race of genius inventors known as the Technomites. These inventors set out to create an army of clones. Ratchet &amp; Clank are supplied with an all-new arsenal of upgradable weapons along with some old favorites, like the Agents of Doom, the Hypershot and the Suck Cannon. Gameplay includes an RPG-like experience system that allows the player to build buy new mods, similar to Up Your Arsenal. Ratchet can also collect pieces of different armor sets. These can be worn and mixed at will, but full sets (helmet, gloves, boots, suit) provide extra abilities. Ratchet&apos;s hovercraft races, Giant Clank&apos;s space battles, and Clank&apos;s battle robot arenas as minigames are all tossed into the mix with the platforming elements. Multiplayer is supported through Wi-Fi Ad Hoc or Infrastructure with 4 game modes- DeathMatch, Team DeathMatch, Capture the Flag, and Iron Lombox Challenge. In the Iron Lombox Challenge mode the players need to complete specific goals like loading cows into a giant meat truck or collecting power cells for the team.</story>

    <story>Ratchet &amp; Clank is a platform/adventure game in a similar vein to the 3D versions of the Rayman, Sonic, Mario, or other games. It involves the two protagonists Ratchet, a furry alien creature, and Clank, a nerdy little robot, going on a quest to find Captain Qwark and ultimately to help save the galaxy. Ratchet &amp; Clank includes many of the best features of previous similar games, but makes itself unique in a number of ways. Firstly each of the game&apos;s levels are huge sweeping vistas with extremely detailed buildings which are visible at all times (i.e. there is no distance fog). This means that a building on the horizon is not just a backdrop; in all likelihood Ratchet will be exploring it in a few moments time. Secondly, the game includes a number of sub-games, such as a space fight sequence and a number of turret shoot-outs which are akin to Missile Command in the first person. The game has over twenty levels (planets) and includes as many real-time cut-scenes which tell the story. Also of note is that the story is non-linear, requiring the player to return to previous levels to complete objectives and to choose between multiple paths forward. There is also a respectable array of weapons, gadgets, and accessories to find or buy as the game progresses, which offer some unique gameplay features.</story>

    <story>The year is 2010. Joshua Harwell and Stephanie McMurrough got a job as waiters in the opening event of Geo City, a new underground city that marks a step forward in advanced and safe city design. Everything is going well...but then a levee breaks and the Hudson River unleashes its wrath on Geo City. Panic and chaos spreads around the place. Who will survive? Raw Danger is the spiritual successor of Disaster Report (AKA SOS- The Final Escape in Europe). In this game you must guide not only Joshua and Stephanie but also several other characters out of their pending underwater grave. Those characters include Amber Brazil, a young woman wrongly accused of murdering her brother, a cab driver, an amnesiac and a schoolgirl. By making the right choices you get to play also as Keith Helm, the hero of the previous game. The main goal of the game is getting past various obstacles and challenges while keeping your body temperature. As the temperature drops the characters&apos; movement slows down and eventually they&apos;ll collapse. You can keep warm with heat sources such as stoves, radiators and barrel fires, which are used also to save the game and cook food that charges your energy. Each character has its own type of gameplay- Joshua is strong and young and can perform physically challenging tasks, Amber has handcuffs which limit her movement and must use stealth tactics to avoid the police, and the taxi driver uses his taxi to avoid different disasters.</story>

Rayman has been captured by the pirates as well and is lamenting his troubles in his prison cell, when he meets his good friend, Globox. Globox has smuggled in a silver Lum, given to him by the great fairy, Ly. With the power of the silver Lum, Rayman is able to once more shoot his fists. With his power restored, the pair escape the flying prison ship and embark on another adventure to save the entire world! Rayman 2- The Great Escape is the sequel to Rayman, a 2D side-scrolling platform game. Unlike the previous game, Rayman 2 is entirely in free-roaming 3D environments, similar to Super Mario 64. Rayman has many unique abilities that can help him get around the world. In addition to being able to shoot his fists, he can use his hair to hover like a helicopter, and even glide on air currents in certain places. He can climb certain walls and ceilings and can even use his fists to swing from special purple Lums which are shaped like rings. Rayman also has many unique items at his disposal, such as powder kegs which can be carried or fly like jets, strange warheads with legs that he can ride and steer like bucking mules, and gigantic plums that can be thrown into the water to create new paths. Rayman&apos;s goal is to find the four masks of the world, which allow the owner to reawaken Polokus, the spirit of the world. These masks are scattered far and wide, and are well hidden and guarded, so it is not an easy task. By gathering the yellow Lums, Rayman will gain access to new worlds, which will take him to the locations of new masks. Collecting yellow Lums also rewards him with new powers and life meter extensions.</story>

    <story>Globox, a friend of Rayman, has placed the world into a deadly possibility. By eating Andre, the Lord of the Dark Lums, Globox has enraged the Hoodlums, who plan to take back their master no matter what the cost to the world around them. It&apos;s up to Rayman to save the day and find a cure to rid the Dark Lord from Globox. Rayman 3- Hoodlum Havoc is a 3D third-person platform game. Rayman, the main hero, jumps and punches his way through numerous colorful levels, with Globox (and Andre inside him) tagging along and occasionally commenting on the goings-on. Rayman&apos;s main weapon is his fist; he can use it to shoot projectiles at the attacking Hoodlums and other foes, and the projectiles are more powerful when the fist is charged by holding down the &amp;quot;shoot&amp;quot; button. The game is divided into several worlds, each divided into a couple of levels; the game is saved automatically after each level. In between the worlds, the player has to complete a mini-game where he has to surf along light-beams in a psychedelic environment. Rayman can also come across power-ups which temporarily give him a special power- the green power-up allows him to shoot tornadoes, the blue power-up gives him the ability to use a grappling hook, the yellow power-up allows him to fly for a short while, the orange power-up allows him to shoot precisely guided missiles and the red power-up grants him a very powerful fist that can bash doors. These power-ups are always necessary to defeat an enemy or a boss, or to get to the next part of the level. Rayman can find and free the Teensies locked in cages throughout the level; the freed Teensies will express their gratitude by opening up the next part of the map or by summoning some bonuses to collect. Each six Teensies freed increases Rayman&apos;s health bar. There are numerous bonuses hidden throughout the levels; completing the levels with lots of score will unlock humorous animations and mini-games. The Game Boy Advance Rayman 3 links to the Gamecube through the link port, allowing you to play exclusive mini-games on both systems, and download new levels to the GBA.</story>

Use your speed in 12 race courses where you must take risks, use tricks, and trip up your opponents as you run, slide, climb, and helicopter for the checkered flag. You can freeze the other player for a few seconds by shooting him with an ice beam. For these battles, 12 different maps are included. Knockout your opponent with power-ups, traps, and special ammo, and four-player action - splitscreen on consoles, over the internet on PC.

    <story>Real World Golf is a golfing game that makes use of the Gametrak system. The Gametrak is an external piece of hardware that is included with the game. The Gametrak can, through the use of gloves which are connected to it with tiny wires, accurately read out the swing the player makes with the included tiny golf club. It determines the power with which you hit, but also any effects you may put on the ball. The Gametrak can read out speeds ranging from 2000 miles per hour to 1 millimeter per hour. Once you start the game you no longer need to use your keyboard or gamepad, all menus can be navigated with use of simple hand gestures. The game itself contains ten 18-hole courses which have to be unlocked one by one. You can play in various modes such as tournament, championship, training and party. Party mode includes several mini games such as hitting cars in the parking lot, hitting a giant bulls-eye in the sky, hitting as close to a target as possible or hitting through hoops. Each game mode can be played against the AI or friends in hotseat multiplayer.</story>

    <story>REALPLAY Golf is a golf game with all of the usual types of mode (Stroke Play, Tournaments, Practice, Multiplayer, Stableford, etc.) featured. The real difference between this and the multitude of Golf games available for PlayStation 2 is that it does not support the DualShock Controller at all - it uses its own wireless motion-sensing Golf Club. Players are required to use the wireless club to take their shots using realistic golf swings. There is a Driving Range and a Putting Course to practice on before setting out on a full round of Golf. The game is set amongst 8 courses, featuring environments from the U.K, USA, France, New Zealand, Scotland and the Caribbean. There is a range of A.I. players to compete against, each with their own personality and play style. These can be unlocked as reward for winning tournaments, achieving given feats or reducing your handicap.</story>

    <story>REALPLAY Puzzlesphere is an action puzzle game in the vein of Marble Madness and Super Monkey Ball using the Realplay system of motion sensitive controllers. Included with a game is a motion sensitive orb that works much like a Wii Remote. If you tilt it in any direction the ball on screen will gather up momentum in that direction. The further you tilt it the more momentum it will gather. The goal of the game is to guide the ball on the screen through complex 3D courses where you have to avoid gaps, make jumps and roll around sharp corners. There are various checkpoints along the way that serve as respawn points and make sure the player doesn&apos;t cut short on the designated circuit. When the ball on screen falls out of bounds the player loses a life. He only receives a few lives for each level where he has to make do with. One additional control is the air brake that applies a sudden momentum in the exact opposite direction as the current rolling direction. This can be used for late escapes. To make it more difficult fans can try to blow you off course. A variety of power-ups can be collected to improve your air brake for example, but they are placed at hard to get locations. The game comes with 36 levels in 6 different environments. There are four game modes- practice, arcade, time trial and 2-4 player time attack.</story>

    <story>Orphaned by bandits and left for dead on the frontier, Red Harlow grew up with a scar burned into his hand and the lust for revenge burned into his heart. Surviving as a bounty hunter in the rough-and-tumble Old West, Red stays ever watchful for some clue that could lead him to the men who murdered his father and mother -- and then one day, that clue appears. Step into Red&apos;s spurred boots, and take up his mission of revenge. Red Dead Revolver features environments and artistry inspired by the classic spaghetti westerns films, mixed with third-person shooter gameplay similar to that of Max Payne. The gameplay and story proceed linearly through stages, including several levels in which you play as different characters (a British trick shooter, a female rancher, a renegade Mexican general, a stealthy native warrior, and a Buffalo Soldier). Each character has his own signature move- for instance, Red&apos;s Dead-Eye slows down time and allows you to set up targets for a rapid fan fire takedown, while General Diego&apos;s flare rifle lets you specify a target for bombardment by Diego&apos;s cannons. Beating each level will earn you reward money (and chaining together many limb shots and multiple kills will earn you bonus money). You can spend your cash on unlockable characters (for the multiplayer game), journal entries that offer backstory and character info, or an array of canonical Old West weaponry, including pistols, rifles, and shotguns of many varieties, as well as knives, molotovs, poison and dynamite. The game features pistol dueling with certain boss characters, as a mini-game mechanic in which you time your draw to an opportune moment and prepare targets as you raise your gun. There is also a multiplayer game (split-screen only, not networked), which you can play with friends and/or AI bots. Multiplayer incorporates a wide array of powerups, an alternative dueling showdown mode, and two kinds of optional poker sub-games (based on stud or Texas Hold &apos;Em) that mix some strategy into the action.</story>

    <story>The Ultor Corporation of Mars is successful because of the mineral wealth of that planet. It employs a number of miners and scientists to mine the Noachite ores far underground. The miners are constantly pressured by the guards to work harder and faster, while at the same time being forced to share their meager resources. While the mines itself are dangerous, so too is the mysterious plague that has broken out among the ranks of miners, killing many. Into this low morale situation, propaganda against Ultor has begun appearing, signed only by Eos. These pamphlets and posters urge the miners to rise up against their oppressors and take a stand, also recruiting members into their secretive Red Faction. As a result of Eos&apos; efforts, tensions are rising high between the Ultor corporation and it&apos;s workers, any little incident could ignite... Red Faction is a first-person shooter and adventure game. Players take the role of Parker, a miner working underground for the Ultor Corporation. Equipped in an environment suit, Parker is protected from various hazards and able to breathe deep in the mines and in airless locations. At times, Parker also needs to travel undercover in more a lesser protective disguise. Parker defends himself with a variety of weapons, most which feature a primary and secondary firing mode. The weapons are divided into- hand weapons such as riot shields and flamethrowers, light arms which include pistols and shotguns, heavy arms featuring rocket launchers and sub-machine guns and finally weapons that are thrown or placed such as grenades and explosives. The game features a variety of vehicles to drive in first-person; including jeeps, drillers, flying craft and submarines. In order to survive, Parker must link up and aid his fellow miners, receiving direction and objectives via com-link messages. Red Faction features an game engine called Geo-Mod. It allows holes to be blasted into all manner of terrain including floors, walls and ceilings. While limited to certain surfaces, such as rock, ice and concrete, this nonetheless results in a more destructible environment where deviation from the level design is encouraged. Players are able to at multiple points, create their own paths, tunneling past obstacles and into new environments. Only heavy explosives; such as missiles, torpedoes, grenades and plastique will allow the terrain destruction of this sort.</story>

    <story>Long since the revolt from the mining of Mars, a new group has taken over Red Faction, and their sights are set on the dictator, Chancellor Sopot. Sopot originally created the Red Faction soldiers using a form of nano technology but, fearing they would fight back, ordered them to be destroyed. As the leader of the group, your task is to take back freedom that was lost, and save your skin as well as that of those who work with you. As was originally designed in the first Red Faction, Geo-Mod builds the world around you as a means to destroy it. Using rockets, mines and the many other weapons available, you can take down walls, blast through doors (therefore deleting the need for a security key) and bring down enemies by destroying the floor that they stand on. Vehicles can also be used to help in your tasks. Multiplayer modes are also included for up to 4 players, as well as a collection of bots. As a note, the PC version does not have multiplayer.</story>

    <story>The game is set in medieval Japan, at the time of warring states. Shingen Takeda and Nobunaga Oda clans are fighting each other, trying to gain supremacy over the entire Japan. The heroine of the game is a young girl called Kurenai (crimson), the daughter of a prominent Japanese engineer whose new invention (apparently, a destructive weapon) has drawn the attention of the warring clans. Ninjas sent by Nobunaga Oda attack his workshop, kill him, and leave Kurenai hanging from a tree tied by tetsugen, a piece of wire used by ninjas as a weapon. But a kind woman saves Kurenai, and trains her to be a ninja herself. This is where her quest for revenge begins. Red Ninja is an action game with stealth elements. The primary weapon Kurenai uses is the deadly tetsugen. During the game you&apos;ll learn to perform new moves with this weapon. You can also use other weapons, such as a blowgun and throwing knives. Kurenai can jump, hang from ledges, and roll. There is a fair amount of platform-like sequences where she will have to demonstrate her acrobatic ninja technique. An effective way to kill enemies is to use stealth. Kurenai can approach enemies silently and hide behind objects. She can also seduce enemies, by talking to them in a sexy way and luring them to their death - a move that doesn&apos;t always work.</story>

    <story>This game, based on the famous Quentin Tarantino movie Reservoir Dogs, fills in the gaps in the movie that are only briefly mentioned (like the robbery at the jewelry store). Throughout the story you get to play all seven main characters, from Mr. Blonde to Mr. White. The missions are introduced by game engine cutscenes, which often recreate moments from the film. For example, in the first mission you see Mr. Pink holding his famous monologue I don&apos;t think we got set up, I know we got set up! and then you play Mr. Blue as the police arrives at the jewelry where your goal is to get out alive. To do so, you have two choices- be a psychopath and shoot your way out, or try the subtle approach without harming anyone. For instance, if you do not want to harm anyone you can take a hostage and then threaten the police to lay their weapons down and order them to face the wall. There are a few missions in which you must drive a car but mostly you walk through them. Like in the Hitman series, the game shows at the end of every mission how well you have done.</story>

    <story>Picking up six years after Resident Evil 2, the fourth game in the series follows former cop (now US agent) Leon S. Kennedy to Europe on a top secret mission to investigate the disappearance of the president&apos;s daughter Ashley. As Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out who or what is behind everything. Old friends...and enemies...lurk around every corner as Leon attempts to find out who is truly behind the kidnapping of the president&apos;s daughter. Resident Evil 4 is a major change from the previous installments. Instead of a fixed third person perspective, the game features a new behind the back movement camera angle and an over the shoulder aiming feature that allows players to control their gun movement for specific body part hits. It features a brand new AI system and more open environments that allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game. The entire item system has also been revamped, so that smaller items no longer require an entire item space to hold. Instead, items take up blocks of space in a briefcase according to their real life size, to allow for many more items and weapons. Leon can collect treasure from enemies or from the surrounding area, and visit the infamous merchant to purchase bigger briefcases, treasure maps, weapons upgrades, and powerful weapons such as the one-shot RPG. The game also includes a mode called Separate Ways (which is not included on the original GameCube release and was added to later platforms only) similar to Resident Evil 2&apos;s game A/B system, where the player must play the game through the eyes of Ada Wong. There is also the Mercenaries from Resident Evil 3, which allows the player to play survival scenarios as character such as Hunk and even Albert Wesker himself.</story>

    <story>Resident Evil Outbreak returns you to the Umbrella Corporations disaster that consumed Racoon city. You play one of eight ordinary citizens of Racoon city attempting to survive the carnage caused by the T-Virus. There are five different scenarios in this game. Initially only one is open to you, this is concerned with the outbreak in the city, but upon its completion further scenarios with different plots and locations become available. Gameplay is similar to the previous Resident Evil games. It consists mainly of exploring, solving puzzles, finding items and of course surviving. This is also the first game of the resident evil franchise that can be played on-line, with up to four people playing cooperatively in order to survive.</story>

    <story>Raccoon City has been infected by the Umbrella corporations deadly T-Virus. A mutagenic toxin that turns its human victims into flesh eating zombies. The few survivors must try to escape the city before the government deploys its final solution to the problem of Raccoon City... Once again you find yourself playing the eight characters of the original Resident Evil- Outbreak in more scenarios set in the ruins of what used to be Raccoon City. The new game has several new scenarios and boasts new gameplay developments for the Resident Evil series. Loading times have been reduced and while the previous Outbreak was on-line enabled in the US, this game is the first on-line Resident Evil game in Europe. The locals featured in this game include both the familiar (The Raccoon Police Department) and the exotic (A mutated jungle at mid-day) ones. The game boasts a hefty amount of unlockable material such as artworks, notes, trivia, and character costumes. The game is backwards compatible with your save file from Resident Evil- Outbreak, meaning that you can take your unlocked content to this new setting.</story>

    <story>Resident Evil- Survivor 2 - Code- Veronica is a game based on the Resident Evil franchise, similar in concept to the original Resident Evil- Survivor, though it is not actually related. It is a port of an arcade game. As in the original Code- Veronica game, Claire Redfield and Steve Burnside must escape Rockfort Island, which is infested with zombies. In this case however, the game can be played either with the Guncon 2 lightgun or with the standard controller as a first-person shooter. Players can choose either character or can play cooperatively as both. As in most lightgun games, the object is to make it through an environment while shooting enemies. It is somewhat less typical in that you have full roaming control over your character rather than being stuck on rails. More unusually, a timer begins as you enter each area. If the timer runs out before you leave, Nemesis will appear and chase you.</story>

This is reflected in the car handling, the influence of the weather and the endless tweaking of the car set-up. There are eight officially licensed cars to choose from, with familiar names such as the Subaru Impreza, Citroen Xsara, Peugeot 206, Mitsubishi Lancer Evo and Toyota Corolla, but you need to unlock them by finishing school lessons, winning a rally or making it to the end of a season. Next to the usual training, quick races, rally seasons and multiplayer mode (only 4-player &apos;hot-seat&apos;), you can test your skills in the Richard Burns Challenge, a time trial mode in which get the chance to go head to head with Burns himself. There are 36 stages in total, divided over six countries. The in-game music has been produced by Paul Oakenfold, Andy Hunter, Pepe Deluxe and the Plump DJs.</story>

    <story>20 years ago, an alternate World War II occurred, where both Axis and Allies developed mecha technology, known as Armored Fighting Walkers (AFWs). As a result, battles continued in different ways and Russian forces were more instrumental in the eventual defeat of Japan. The end of the war has had Japan divided between the allied forces, similar to Germany. Japan is now split into a communist North Japan and an Democratic South Japan, governed separately. Without any obvious cause, Japan erupted into civil war between it&apos;s halves for four years. Dubbed the Japan War, it further weakened Japan&apos;s economy and fueled resentment between people living in the North and the South. In 1964, Masami von Weizegger is a AFW pilot in the South Japan forces. While field testing a prototype AFW, it is stolen by North Japanese agents and Masami is dispatched to recover the stolen material. As Masami&apos;s team attempts to retrieve the AFW, they stumble into a military operation that threatens to erupt into all-out war. Ring of Red is a turn-based action/strategy game set in an alternative post-World War II Japan. Players take the role of members of the South Japan military who are put on a hunt for a stolen AFW. During battles, mechs are moved into position on a grid-based map and may engage different enemy units or occupy specific points. As turns are taken, time passes, shifting the battlefield through daytime and nighttime hours as well as different weather effects. All of these affect the accuracy of weapons as well as the types of abilities that can be used. Battles end when objectives are met by either side. Putting a twist on the turn-based genre, Ring of Red features turn-based movements with real-time combat. When two AFWs engage on the battle grid, players are taken to a real-time battle where they have limited time to engage one another before refueling is required. Here the AFW is viewed from 3rd person and may be moved forward and back and given orders. Firing on the enemy requires aiming, in first person, by the player. The AFW uses a steam powered cannon which must be pressurized before firing, aiming at either an enemy AFW or at enemy support crew. Additionally AFWs can engage in close combat if they are close enough, delivering punches to one another. Each AFW pilot also has his own statistics and own special abilities, that can be used only once per battle, that can be called upon at any time. AFWs also feature unique statistics, being divided into four types- Standard, Light, 4-Leg (Heavy) and Anti-AFW. Each AFW unit is actually a group made up of three ground units- one of which acts as crew for the AFW, while the other two walk alongside. Support units are divided into types including- Infantry, Shooter, Supply, Medical, Mechanic and Recon. Each of these types of support units has different skills in battle and individually have different abilities and statistics. The abilities available and used change depending on which positions the units are assigned to. Additionally many special abilities need to charge in the rear ranks before becoming available for usage. These abilities include firing special types of munitions (including flash, heat, smoke and impact), laying down mines or tripwire, laying down a barrage of fire, throwing grenades, healing units, sniping specific targets, morale boosts, AFW repairs, neutralization of enemy effects and disarming enemy mines/tripwire.</story>

In Harvest Fishing, you play one of the 4 possible characters available- The Father, Mother, Brother and Sister. All have their own personal reasons in catching the King River fish and are subject to different story plots. Each also have different starting character statistics. GAMEPLAY Gameplay of the Harvest Fishing may be categorized as the following- Real-time Fishing Simulation and Preparation The fishing simulation in Harvest Fishing consists of various approaches which refer to different types of tools you can choose from to fish- Different fishing rods, different baits and lures attract different fish, making some easier or harder depending on which combination you choose. Fishing instruments may be purchased at a local store, while bait may either be purchased or be searched in your surroundings. You start with one type of rod and minimal bait varieties. Catching fish requires you to fish near a body of water and wait for the fish to bite (results vary on different rods). After a bite, you enter a real-time fishing simulation sequence, where you can visibly see the fish underwater. You then have to lure the fish in while making sure your fishing line doesn&apos;t break. Captured fish may then be released, sold at the fishmonger for money or used for cooking ingredients or other requirements for sub-quests. Failure to catch fish during this simulation will result in your character losing HP as well as the bait. Adventuring There are a lot of fishing spots to choose from in this game. The others however must be first unlocked by following the plot of the story. Several mini-quests are also available to choose as well as participating in fishing and cooking tournaments. Successfully catching fish will add experience to your fishing skill which will lead to leveling up your fishing level. Successfully trying cooking recipes will also increase your cooking level skill.</story>

You travel between planets on mundane assignments, only to return to your home station to find the place a complete wreck, courtesy of an evil alien race. All crew members have been killed, violently, and it is up to you to stop the alien race, or run like hell. RLH encompasses seven chapters, with multiple areas and missions per chapter. You will be tasked with solving puzzles, killing aliens, and finding out just what the hell happened. Enemies come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from small grunt type enemies to huge enemies that tower ten feet above you. Each has it&apos;s own health and power, and each will provide a good challenge. In a departure from previous survival horror games, there isn&apos;t much puzzle solving and not much slow times. The entire game is a fast paced, frantic battle for survival, hence the title. When spotted by an enemy, it will chase you until it&apos;s either killed or blocked... that&apos;s why you must run like hell. RLH features celebrity voice actors, such as Lance Henriksen (Frank Black from TV&apos;s Millenium), Michael Ironside (bad guy from Total Recall), Kate Mulgrew (Star Trek Voyager&apos;s Captain Janeway) and Brad Douriff, the voice of Chucky from the Child&apos;s Play movies. You will use a variety of weapons to defeat the aliens, such as a shotgun, and more futuristic weapons, like a pulse blaster and nerve destroyer.</story>

    <story>A complete remake of the classic 1986 title Defender of the Crown (not to be confused with the Remastered Windows version released in 2002), in Robin Hood- Defender of the Crown the player plays as the legendary folk outlaw in his quest to reclaim the throne of England after Richard Lionheart was captured in the crusades and his brother, John Lackland, usurped the throne and left him for dead in the Holy Land, attracting the ire of several knights. In a heated argument, he considered them to be traitors, causing a civil war to start. Several gameplay features were changed from the classic title such as the player being Robin Hood himself (instead of picking one of four pretenders), full 3D graphics, a plot included with the game and the goal being to be the first to reach and conquer King John&apos;s stronghold in Cornwall. To do so, the player must build an army large enough to hold enough shires, which generate money from taxes. This money can then be used to hire new troops (peasants, archers, footmen and the mighty knights and catapults) or pay King Richard&apos;s ransom, which allow to enlist loyalist knights. As with the original game, action occurs in a turn-based map of England where the player decides which actions to take- conquer a neighbouring shire with Little John&apos;s army and hire soldiers either for him or territory defense, raid a castle or caravan, build strongholds, hold tournaments or spy on the other lords using Maid Marian&apos;s contacts on the court. Each of the attacking actions bring a quick minigame to be played- The first mini-game that appears is the archery raid; in this mode, the player sees the action directly from Robin Hood&apos;s eyes while he lurks on a tree, the goal being to use Robin&apos;s trustworthy bow and arrow to hit cavalry guards and the convoy as they pass by his spot. As some guards are also armed with a bow, Robin can also hide behind the log for cover. If the player attacks a guarded territory, the game enters a strategic mode where the battle takes place on a three-lane field, and the goal is to vanquish the enemy defenses of force him to flee by launching direct attacks on each lane. Sword fighting pits the player against one or more opponents, depending on the setting. The goal is simple- slash everyone by throwing blows and dodge/parry the opponents&apos; own. During raids there is also a timer that represents the time before sunrise - failing to escape before that or being killed results on Robin&apos;s imprisonment. Battles are done on a real-time fashion, where both armies are placed on the far-sides of a multi-lane battlefield. The player chooses which lane to attack (or defend) and if successful, the opponent will lose enough units to flee or simply wait for their deaths. Jousting in a tournament allows the player to fight for fame, and then for gold and land. To do so, after picking an opponent, he starts by building enough speed, and then slam the spear into the opponent, the goal being to knock him from his horse. Some shires are protected by castles, and to conquer them, first a siege must be laid in. This requires the player to load up on catapults and then destroy each wall of the fortification by throwing boulders at it. Each wall represents a part of the defending army- the most damage done, the easier it becomes to invade it.</story>

    <story>Robocop places you in the titanium-coated-with-kevlar boots of Alex Murphy, killed in the line of duty and resurrected as the cyborg officer Robocop. The 2003 game features a new plot not featured in any of the films. Crime is up in Neo-Detroit due to the rapid proliferation of a new designer drug Brain Drain, and the efforts of crime lord William Nexx to control its profitable distribution. Meanwhile, a mayoral race is heating up and getting dirty. And of course, mega-corporation OCP&apos;s role in all this is almost certain, but unclear. Robocop will have to get to the bottom of all of these mysteries through 9 missions. Gameplay is handled as a typical first-person-shooter, with various Robocop enhancements. His HUD is projected on screen and points out available targets. The player can mark up to three targets with a lock-on button, who Robo will then auto-aim at in sequence. Thermal vision can be activated to see through walls in a limited distance. Multiple weapons are also available, from the signature automatic pistol, to missile launchers and energy weapons. Objectives are given for each mission, from rescuing hostages to finding clues. Clues can be examined after each mission to explore the story (also updated through TV news breaks, in the style of the films). If the player can target and shoot a enemy&apos;s pistol, they will surrender and can be arrested. Should the player kill a hostage or surrendered enemy, they will take damage, forcing the player to follow Robocop&apos;s ethics and prime directives.</story>

    <story>Robot Warlords is a one or two player, turn based, strategy game featuring battling robots in real Tokyo settings. The background story, which is a single player game, is one of political unrest and intrigue, at least that&apos;s what it says in the game description. The Japanese army is attempting a military takeover, groups of them have declared martial law and are riding around in robots called Bullets to enforce it. The government doesn&apos;t want to launch an all out counter attack because that would result in massive civilian casualties. Instead they turn to Professor Matsuzakai who developed the Bullet machines and a handful of people at the Odaiba Bullet repair site. With major Kazuma Saeki in charge Operation Velvet is launched, with only four operational experimental machines at their disposal they must stop the rebellion in seven days otherwise an all out attack will be launched against the rebel forces in Tokyo with corresponding catastrophic loss of life and massive damage. The game starts with a long conversation between the chief cabinet secretary, the head of the army and the Japanese Prime minister, This sets the scene and introduces all the characters. When this is over the player starts on their first mission. Prior to a mission each of the Bullets can be customised, this includes naming and changing the colour of each machine, assigning weapons to each arm and shoulder, and upgrading body parts. The player also has a number of TP or Technique points which they can use to install battle manoeuvres such as the &apos;Preparation For Combat&apos; technique which costs three TP and decreases the enemy weapon hit ratio by -20 and the player&apos;s hit ratio by -10. Only six techniques can be installed at a time. The game consists of eleven missions spread over a seven day period and each mission is turn based. In each turn the player selects whether they wish to move a Bullet in normal mode, just a few adjacent cells, or turbo mode in which they can travel further. While moving they may optionally employ one of the deployed combat techniques. Once the player has set their Bullet&apos;s destination they may choose whether or not to attack their opponents, in an attack multiple opponents can be selected. While various battle techniques used by the players and their opponents affect the hit ratio and consequently the damage caused by an attack, other game elements also do this. When firing through obstacles such as cars the hit ratio is halved, if the line of fire passes through two cars it is halved again and nothing gets through three cars. There are also special cells known as obstruction squares which halve the hit rate of any firing line that passes through them. </story>

    <story>Robotech- Battlecry tells the entire Macross saga of Robotech, from the first contact with the Zentraedi invasion force over the skies of Macross city, to the final battle between human and Zentraedi in the scorched ruins of Earth. The player takes the role of Jack Archer, an ace Veritech pilot in the SDF. His missions range from hunting down and destroying Zentraedi Lieutenants in destroyed cities to defending shuttles traveling through deep space wreckage fields. Characters from the show, voiced by the same actors who did the voices in the Robotech cartoon, will make cameo appearances throughout the game. As the game progresses Jack will gain access to new Veritech models, which have different stats but mostly the same abilities. In Fighter mode the Veritech can fire a rapid fire Gunpod bullets or homing missiles as well as drop a decoy pod that will attract enemy missiles. Guardian mode is slower than Fighter mode and loses the ability to drop decoy pods, but can aim Gunpod bullets, gains more powerful missiles, and can pick up mission critical items. Battloid mode can not fly or fire missiles, but can rapidly aim the Gunpod and automatically shoot down enemy missiles. Battloid can also go into sniper mode and hit enemies at a distance with a very powerful charged Gunpod shot. Each mode can be switched between instantly and whenever desired. Medals are awarded for achieving milestones in the game, such as shooting down enemy units or winning boss battles, and these can unlock new Veritech models, paint jobs, and arenas for two-player mode.</story>

Gameplay is based on hitting scrolling notes on the screen in time (scrolling vertically for drum and guitar), and getting the right pitch for the vocals (scrolling horizontally at the top of the screen, along with the lyrics). The game offers a Solo Tour Mode for a single player or a Band World Tour (as well as Quick Play) for two to four players. By doing well players earn cash to customize the characters in the Rock Shop, with tattoos, face paint, clothing and logos. Customized characters are automatically locked to an instrument. Other customizations include movements on stage, instruments, and the general physique and appearance in the game. To succeed, players need to reach a set score through their combined performances. Multipliers for playing perfectly are tracked for the individual instruments and there can also be separate difficulty levels. The Star Power from the Guitar Hero series has been replaced by Overdrive, a meter filled by not making any mistakes in certain sections of a song. In band play using Overdrive also increases the band&apos;s score multiplier. Players who fail during the song are locked out and the audio mix takes over. Other band members can revive the player by using their Overdrive. Failed players will however drag down the band&apos;s overall performance, so it becomes important to bring back band members. Next to the Overdrive sections, there are also Union Phrases (score bonus and extra Overdrive) and sometimes Big Rock Endings at the end of a song where another bonus can be gained. In the Tour Mode players visit 41 venues in seventeen different cities. After the initial venues, others need a certain numbers of fans to be unlocked and certain continents only become available when tour buses or private jets are acquired. Not every venue comes with a set list of tracks. They consists of single tracks, multiple tracks, custom setlists or mystery setlists. Performing poorly can also have the band lose fans. Extra competition is included to attract managers, roadies and deals with record labels. Next to the main modes there is also a versus mode for the individual instruments (Tug of War), Score Duel (get the most points) and a Tutorial mode. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions feature multiplayer games with new songs through downloadable content. The European version is not sold as a single package. Instead, there is an instruments package and the game is sold separately, for a much higher price than the original US release.</story>

    <story>Rock Band 2 is the sequel to the 2007 musical simulation game Rock Band and offers similar gameplay. Directly competing with Guitar Hero- World Tour, the game allows different people to play together as in a band, with the same peripherals as the first game- lead guitar, bass guitar, microphone and a drum set. The new drum and guitar controllers for this version, bundled or sold separately, have been revised and older controllers are also supported. The guitar controller, modelled after the Fender Stratocaster, has five additional fret buttons near the neck, for fast fingertapping sessions. There is also an effect switch to toggle between five different effects. Players use the instruments to match notes on the screen, divided in different portions for different instruments, along with the lyrics for the singer who need to match the pitch. The original game&apos;s Solo Tour mode and the multiplayer Band World Tour mode have been merged into a single Tour mode where up to four players can cooperate, both local and online (PS3/Xbox 360). Band leaders are no longer necessary and instruments can be swapped at will. From this mode, three options are available- Start Tour (regular tour mode), Tour Challenge (different challenges), and Battle of the Bands (compete against other bands online through score tracking - not on the PS2). The game includes a training mode for the different instruments, as well as a freestyle mode for drummers where they can drum along with custom mp3 files (Xbox 360/PS3). Other modes and modifiers for the regular game modes can be selected from an Extras menu. The in-game characters can also be customized and 84 tracks are included on the disc, with many more as downloadable content (not on the PS2). It is also possible to transfer the songs of the first Rock Band (for a price), and downloadable content as well as the two track packs.</story>

    <story>Rogue Galaxy is the North American and European localized version of Rogue Galaxy (2005), only released in Japan at the time. Instead of only localizing the game, developer Level-5 Inc. spent 2 years to improve the game and add new features and content. This version was also re-released in Japan as Rogue Galaxy (Director&apos;s Cut). The original single-layer DVD was replaced by dual-layer and the doubled amount of space was used for smoother, better-looking graphics and additional data. Aside from the 4 existing planets, a fifth one, Alistia, was added. It is not part of the main story, but deepens the storyline and has new quests and items. A key to access the new world can be found in chapter 8. The existing Insectron Tournament sidequest has been expanded with two species of Insectrons, each with 8 types of Insectrons per species. The level design of Rosencaster Prison, the Gladius Towers, the Daytron factory, Rosa&apos;s desert town, and Rosa&apos;s Labyrinth has also been altered. Over 2,000 lines of additional voice dialogue were added, the battle animations were reworked, damaging enemies has become easier (attack formula revision) and Toady&apos;s analysis of weapons has also been simplified. Other gameplay improvements include the introduction of collectible Burning Chips, which power the Burning Strike attack, more items overall, two new weapons for each character (except Jaster), with 140 weapons in total, and 5 bonus costumes for each character (6 for Kisala and Simon).</story>

There are eight missions to complete which have a combination of action and puzzle solving elements. You will often need to use stealth to be successful, making sure you quietly infiltrate an area without being seen, or if you are seen making sure no one sounds an alarm! You can hide in the shadows, in crates and vents, hang from the ceiling, and sneak up on guards to kill them before they see you. Of course, when action is required, there are a wide variety of weapons that will be used throughout the game; some weapons you&apos;ll come across are a pistol, a rifle, a crossbow, grenades, proximity mines, and more. There are three different difficulty levels available.</story>

    <story>A planned attack on Nu Earth goes wrong when a General turns traitor resulting in the massacre of Rogue&apos;s comrades. The game starts with Rogue and his comrades launched from a drop-ship. They come under fire from the Norts due to the information that had been leaked by the General. Upon landing the first mission is a tutorial in how to use Rogue’s skills and also the Bio-chips of Gunnar and then Bagman. The third Bio-chip of Helm is received in a later mission. The Bio-chips have their own abilities. Gunnar is stuck to the side of Rogue’s rifle and can be used as a sentry while Rogue flanks the enemy. Bagman provides ammunition and upgrades for Rogue’s equipment made from salvage collected along the way and also looks after his health. Helm is used for accessing computer consoles and panels allowing Rogue access into prohibited areas. Rogue works his way through the various levels as stealthily as is possible trying to take the Norts by surprise with kill moves but with the arsenal at his disposal he is quite capable of also unleashing hell and going toe to toe with the enemy. Tracking the traitor General, Rogue eventually catches up in the final mission with an abundance of Norts trying to stop him. The game is identical across all platforms allowing the user to create numerous profiles and using a checkpoint save feature ensuring that you don’t have to go too far back in the level if you get Rogue killed. There are 3 different skill levels (Normal, Hard and Massacre) which when completed will unlock cheats. The Windows version uses a combination of keyboard (reconfigurable) and mouse, the mouse being essential for aiming and firing. The Xbox and PS2 versions are identical using the left thumb-stick for movement and the right thumb-stick for aiming and right trigger / shoulder button for firing with the other buttons used for various other actions such as weapon changing or grenade throwing. Within each platform, multiplayer is available with the option to play as Rogue, Helm, Gunnar and Bagman, each character having their own attributes. There are 5 arenas of either Stronghold or Progressive. Each map will have an objective such as defending for a certain amount of time against waves of Norts on Stronghold or getting to an objective point on Progressive maps. High scores will be saved with the user’s profile.</story>

    <story>By combining a Roland Garros license with their tried and tested tennis engine, Namco brings a third Smash Court Tennis title for the PlayStation 2. It was released exclusively in Europe, and was based on Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2. In gameplay, the game isn&apos;t much different from other tennis games in the market, but it differs from games such as Virtua Tennis by having some emphasis on stamina (some players get tired faster than others, and not only run slower but also lose power to return the ball on longer matches) and by forcing the player to hit the ball as well-timed as possible - a nice ball (with a yellow visual cue near the racquet) will be much harder to return, as it will bounce away faster from the player. Featuring 15 real players from both ATP and WTA, the game features several game modes- Roland Garros allows the player to compete in the namesake, exhibition, and spectator, where the player can just sit back and see a game played by the computer, choosing one of the many cameras available, including the classic TV presentation or from the main stand. The beefier mode is the ProTour, where the player creates and customizes his own player, from appearance to playing style, and start a career, taking part in tournaments and completing training sessions in order to improve the player, so he or she can break into the elite. Challenge mode includes the training session mini-games of ProTour, as well as Bomb Tennis, a special mode where the court is filled with bombs, and as a player wins points, the opponent&apos;s side is flooded with even more. The goal is to detonate the bombs by pushing them into the flames, and forcing the opponent to get caught in one explosion. Also included is a complete training mode, which explains in detail the differences between shots and allows newcomers to adapt themselves to the gameplay style of this title. By completing certain goals, the player unlocks additional items, such as clothing, music tracks, trivia cards, player information and even secret players.</story>

    <story>Romance of the Three Kingdoms VII is the first PlayStation 2 installment of the famous strategy series. Like its predecessors, it is based on the classic novel San Guo (Three Kingdoms), written by Luo Guanzhong. The events of the novel (and the game) occur during the 3rd century AD, in the time of the Later Han Dynasty. China is split into several states, the leaders of each one trying to conquer the others and to become the sole leader of the Middle Country. The seventh game of the series offers some innovations - realistic 3D graphics, and the ability to play as any one of the main characters. The game is much more strategy-based than Kessen games, and your success depends on careful planning and training. Combat is turn-based.</story>

    <story>Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII is the eighth installment in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms turn-based strategy game series. Once again, it is based on the events taken from the classic Chinese novel San Guo (Three Kingdoms). The story takes place in 3rd century A.D., when the Han Dynasty was powerless to stop a civil war in China, and when warriors from different provinces of China tried to defeat each other and to gain the power to rule over the whole country. Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII offers some innovations and enhancements. The player can now control all eight main characters during the same game. Of the 711 officer characters, the player can create 100. Each of those officers has unique skills wich can be employed in combat or help to create a powerful army. The player can also freely choose a starting date for the game events, ranging between 184 A.D. (Yellow Turban Rebellion) and 234 A.D. (death of Zhuge Liang, one of the most important characters of the novel).</story>

    <story>Romance of the Three Kingdoms X is the tenth installment of the long-running series and takes place right after the fall of the Han Dynasty. It nearly covers 147 years of Chinese history. Gameplay is the same as previous incarnations, an overhead view, letting the player and the CPU move armies, build cities, gather supplies and attack one another, watching the battles from afar.

    <story>The eleventh installment of the series continues the struggles of the warlords for power of China in the late Han dynasty through 8 available scenarios. Control more than 40 cities, build structures and armies with the help of hundreds of officers and decide the fate of China, yet again. Game Perspective Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI uses the whole map of China from a side-scrolling and rotatable top-down perspective camera. All units, cities, and structures are viewable throughout the map, not requiring any form of espionage beforehand as in earlier Romance of the Three Kingdoms games. When the player(s) decides to end a turn, own and AI units will commence their actions depending on which part of the map the player is currently viewing. Officers There are over 800 officers, complete with individual portraits and biographies, also including other information such as combat skills, blood ties, and unit specialization. Additionally, completing the tutorial will unlock several officers from other periods of medieval China, such as Kong Qiu (Confucius). Officers have statistical abilities which influence how the success rate a mentioned general may carry out a specific task. The abilities are- Leadership, War, Intelligence, Politics, and Charisma. Continuously performing tasks may increase any the primary statistics. In addition to abilities, some officers may also have specific skills. Skills provide unique active or passive capabilities for the officer in mention. For example, Zhao Yun has the Insight skill which renders him immune from all enemy combat strategies. Combat Combat initiates immediately during each player turn. During the turn of any active player, the player may choose to move own units on the map and attack enemy land units or ships. All opponents may be attacked unless under alliance or cease fire, during which the player may also move through their territory freely. Technical Points Player(s) actions may reward the player with technical points. These points may then be invested in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI version of a combat technological tree, thus enabling different strengths for each faction formerly defined only by its officers. Each branch in the technology tree will upgrade a particular unit type or defense option.</story>

    <story>This is a remake of the first Romancing SaGa game. The land of Mardias has experienced 1000 years of peace after the defeat of the 3 evil gods- Death, Saruin and Schirach. The last evil god standing, Saruin, was imprisoned with the power of the 10 Fatestones - scattered across Mardias. One thousand years later since Saruin&apos;s imprisonment, eight adventurers face an unknown destiny against the silent growing evil awaiting to challenge the lands of Mardias once again... Gameplay Romancing SaGa is a 3rd perspective anime role-playing adventure game with turned-based combat. In this game, the player is 1 (one) of the possible 8 (eight) heroes/heroines available in the game. Each character has a different main storyline, however choosing either character does not effect much of the storyline, regardless. In addition to different main storylines, each character has a different starting class (optional) which may be altered throughout the game. Romancing SaGa uses a non-linear storyline. Characters may travel the land regardless of any main plot. The player&apos;s party consists of a maximum of 5 characters, of which may be added or removed throughout the game at your discretion. Gameplay of Romancing SaGa may be categorized as the following- 1. Character Development and Skills Character development in Romancing SaGa is comprised of 2 different developments- The first is automatic statistic development where the characters statistically level-up per attribute (not per level) after each combat. The second is manual skill development where the player can trade in jewels to upgrade several skills of a character e.g. Longsword, Climbing, Search Chests, etc. Character levels are represented by Character Class levels. Certain skills must be upgraded for a character to fulfill the requirements of that class. Each class has different traits, for example a Swordsman gains benefits in attack mode. Character classes do not effect the storyline. Turned-based Combat Standard RPG turned based combat, where the uniqueness of the combat refers to automatic combo capabilities of your characters. Under certain situations, the player&apos;s characters may combine their attacks against an enemy (a combo) thus creating greater effects (in addition of visual effects). Characters in combat throughout the course of combat may develop special weapon skills. Weapon skills may only be attained through combat through enlightenment (Glimmer). Weapon skills use BPs (Battle Points) and (sometimes) DPs (Duration Points), each weapon skill has different BPs, which are effected by the skills of a character, e.g. a character that has a level 2 skill in Longsword uses less BPs for his/her longsword weapon skill. Another interesting feature about the weapons in regard to combat- each character may equip up to 5 weapons (optional) and may choose from those 5 different weapons at any point during combat, thus adding more tactical possibilities in combat. This reason for this may likely relate to DPs (Duration Points) of a weapon. If a DP of a weapon is used up (usually due to use of special weapon skills), the weapon breaks and is unusable during combat. It may only be repaired at a blacksmith or at an inn. Unlike other RPGs, all attributes of the characters (health, etc.) are automatically healed after combat. However, if a character falls during combat, their LPs (Life Points) decrease. If the LP decreases to zero, the character will die permanently. LPs are regained by resting at an inn.</story>

    <story>RTL Biathlon 2007 is a simulation of the winter biathlon sport, combining two disciplines- cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. The competition takes place on nine skiing areas. The skier moves forward by keeping a button pressed, which consumes energy. The amount of energy varies in different sections of the level (more when going downhill, less when going up), and releasing the button allows for some generation, while the skier will move slower. When overexerting the athlete, the energy levels move into orange and red, and a large amount of stamina is consumed. Other techniques include gliding (crouching when going downhill) and sprinting in certain areas. The shooting sections are shown from a first-person perspective. The accuracy depends on the remaining stamina. Players can also hold their breath to steady the rifle, but this depletes the stamina levels further. The different game modes include Practice, Career and Multiplayer. By competing in different leagues, players earn experience points that eventually open up power points to be distributed over a number of skills. At the start of the game, players can choose a preset skier or create a custom one, determining the name, outfit and skill level. Multiplayer is available for up to four players (hot seat mode) or two in split-screen.</story>

    <story>RTL Biathlon 2009 is a simulation of the Biathlon sport. Like the real sport it is basically divided into two sections- skiing and shooting. During the skiing sections the player steers his athlete into the correct direction and watches his stamina. In the middle of the screen is a power bar which gets filled by holding the assigned button - if the bar is too low the athlete gets slow and if it is too high he gets tired. Practically this results in steady button pressing to keep it as high as possible. During the shooting sequences the player shoots on targets while the cursor is wobbling. He can also hold his breath for a short time to steady his aim. In the career mode the player divides points into four categories, e.g. speed or stamina, which influence the athlethe&apos;s capabilities. After successful championships he can improve these stats further. New in this instalment are super-powers which can be chosen at some point. When activated these give a big boost on a stat for a short time, e.g. mountain skiing boosts power when skiing uphill. These are available once per race. There are overall 15 courses which are partly licensed.</story>

The basic handling is the same for most disciplines- steering the athlete in the right directions and pressing a button to perform an action, e.g. jumping. Two exceptions are the shooting part of the biathlon and skating- In the first the player needs to shoot targets with a wobbling cursor and the latter uses the typical rhythm game controls where arrows fly in from one side of the screen and the player needs to press the assigned button at the right time. Tactical elements are used in biathlon where the player needs to look after his fatigue and curling which is a tactical game by definition. The single-player mode consists of different tournaments which contain seven or 15 randomly chosen disciplines. Of course the player also has the option to compile his own tournaments. Additionally there are 43 small missions where the player needs to reach a certain result from a predefined initial situation. Also new are help functions which show exactly when to press which buttons or show the ideal line of movement.</story>

    <story>Following previous winter sports titles (including the official game of the Torino 2006 Olympic Games), 49Games presents another light simulation of some of the most popular winter sports, including alpine skiing, snowboard half-pipe, ski jump, speed skating, biathlon, luge, bobsleigh, skeleton, figure skating and curling, for a total of 18 different events. While not as complex as the specialized games developed by the German company (there&apos;s no waxing the skis, for instance), the game features a solid physics engine, which provides more realism than some of the more arcadish approaches to the genre. Gameplay varies by event, with the player being in full control of the athlete in most events like alpine skiing and half-pipe (which plays like most radical sports games featuring tricks and flicks instead of being on-rails), while other modes feature an higher focus on rhythm, like speed skating and figure skating. Curling plays like most games previously featuring the event, but there are two modes- simulation plays like the actual sport, where a team scores a point for each stone closer to the middle than the opponents&apos; closest, while game awards points for each of the stones inside the target. The game features three modes- Competition, where the player can participate in 5, 9 or all 16 events (or customize them), Campaign, where the player has to complete a number of quick goals to unlock additional tracks and features from previous games, while Career requires the player to compete in 15 levels with an increasing number of events to do the same. Single Events allow the player to train on any event.</story>

There are many trophies to be won, here&apos;s a quick run down- World Cup- Much the same as the Football variety, the best in the world fight to become world champions. 6 Nations- Only 6 nations are represented in this European tournament to play as- Scotland, England, Wales, Ireland, France and Italy. Tri-Nations- Australia, New Zealand and South Africa play in this tournament. Bledisloe Cup- It&apos;s Australia vs New Zealand, in a best of three tournament. Calcutta Cup- Much like the above, except it&apos;s England and Scotland that fight it out.</story>

    <story>Rugby 08 is the seventh rugby union released by Electronic Arts, and the official game of the 2007 IRB Rugby World Cup. It features 23 national teams (some unlicensed), the fully licensed Super 14, Guiness Premiership (England), Celtic League and French and Italian team (unlicensed), as well as the Junior All Blacks, the Australian A&apos;s and the unlicensed Pacific Islanders and Barbarians, as well as dozen of stadiums. Game modes include the Rugby World Cup, Practice, several national and international tournaments such as the 6 Nations. Tri-Nations, Super 14, Guiness Premiership and the European Trophy, as well as the World League, where the player takes complete control of a team in the 3rd division, and builds his way up to the top division, while earning enough transfer points on the field to keep wages in check and get new signings. A new game mode is also featured, where the player has to re-write history from previous world cups in order to unlock highlight videos from each World Cup and other goodies. Other features include more flexible camera control, allowing the player to kick the ball more accurately and react quickly after a scrum or lineout, new set pieces and faster defending formations and improved AI. The Impact Players also make a return, and you can expect Dan Carter to pin-point a punt almost from end to end or Bryan Habana to wreck defenses apart with his speed. The soundtrack is provided by bands such as Malajube, Howling Bells or Tokyo Police Club.</story>

There is no story behind it. You&apos;re merely racing in one of three dozen cars (many based on real-life designs) in fifteen different tracks, ranging from airports to old mines to specially designed stunt arenas. Taking part in either races, stunt shows, or in one-on-one duels, you&apos;ll need to learn not only how to drive, but also when to use power-ups and where the best short cuts are. Power-ups include oil slicks to bombs to a tornado that cleans the course ahead of you. Through the Championship mode, you&apos;ll be able to unlock all the vehicles and tracks.</story>

    <story>A wrestling game featuring a large and varied number of attractive women. The playable characters run the gamut- nurses, schoolgirls, cowgirls, ninjas, and many more. Each combatant has her own repository of clothes to choose from before each match, from a wide selection of standard wrestling outfits, to a series of bikinis, used mainly for the Mud Wrestling mode in the game. A great deal of the game revolves around the personalities of the fighters and the usage of the reputation system. Several matches will require that the player be sworn not to use dirty tactics such as using weapons found around the ring or even to humiliate the opponent. These oaths can be broken by the player, but the consequences are the loss of fan popularity and for the player&apos;s chosen character to develop a dark side to their persona. Popularity comes into play in the game, not only as a statistical boost for the player, but also as an actual aide in combat when the player finds the audience cheering and helping their character to win the match. Much like similar wrestling/fighting titles such as Def Jam- Fight for NY, this sort of help can be a difference maker in a close match.</story>

    <story>Saint Seiya- The Sanctuary is a fighting game based on the Saint Seiya franchise and follows the Gold Saint Saga of the TV series. The player takes the role of a Saint Seiya who has to save the life of the Goddess of Peace Athena. To do that he has to visit twelve temples representing the astrological signs. The gameplay of each level is divided into two parts- Reaching the palace and defeating the Gold Saint. The former is a traditional hack &amp; slash game where the player fights against hordes of enemies. He has the standard move repertoire to his disposal- regular attacks, dodging, blocking and special attacks. For the latter the player needs a certain amount of power in a special energy bar - it decreases with every special attack and increases if the player is hit. When reaching the temple the game switches to a one to one fighting game style. The basic gameplay stays the same but if the special energy bar is filled to the max the play can use an extremely powerful attack which results in a typical anime cutscene. But it is not without downsides- the enemy can block the attack by mastering a quicktime event (pressing a button in the exact moment it appears on screen). Then he starts an equally powerful counter attack which results in a sequence where both players need to mash buttons - if the counter attack is successful depends on which player is faster. If the life energy of one opponent is empty a similar sequence starts.</story>

    <story>Seven years after the fourth game in the series, Samurai Shodown returns. In the game&apos;s time frame, this is the earliest game, hence the Japanese title Samurai Spirits Zero. It takes place in 1786 from January through the later summer. The game is therefore considered a prequel to the series. The overall gameplay was slightly altered. It is a little faster, and the Slash/Bust system has been removed. Each character now has only one version, or the Bust mode is simply replaced by a new character of very similar setup. Combo slashes, sidestepping and fatalities have also vanished. The basic moves have been modeled after the first games in the series. They consist of three types of slashes, a single kick, and various dodge maneuvers similar to Samurai Shodown II. There are 24 characters, a familiar cast with some new faces. Unlike the previous games, it is not possible to kill your opponent.</story>

    <story>Samurai Warriors is Koei&apos;s extension of the popular Dynasty Warriors series. Instead of taking place during the Three Kingdoms era in China, Samurai Warriors takes you back to feudal Japan, during the warring states era. In the game, you take control of actual historical figures such as Yukimura Sanada, Nobunaga Oda, and Hattori Hanzo. Altogether, there are fifteen characters, ten of whom need to be unlocked. Basically, gameplay is almost identical to that of Dynasty Warriors. The main differences are things like the inclusion of indoor castle levels, and a greater variety of enemies. In Dynasty Warriors, enemies were basically either soldiers or archers. In Samurai Warriors, there are soldiers, archers, musketeers, and many different types of ninjas. In terms of story, there are basically only five levels, but depending on your actions in a certain level specific to each character, the story will branch of into two different stories, leading to a good ending or a not as good ending. Updated graphics and a more techno-ish soundtrack top off the additions.</story>

Similar to the other Empires games, it adds turn-based empire-building gameplay to the mix. Although battles are still fought using the same 3rd-person button mashing mechanics that the Samurai Warriors-style games are known for, players now must also choose the battles to maximize the growth of their burgeoning empire in Japan&apos;s Warring States era. In the Empire mode there are several historical battles available. The game also adds two previously unplayable characters, Shibata Katsuie and Sasaki Kojiro, as well as a Create Your Own Character mode.</story>

    <story>Samurai Warriors 2 is a game made by Omega Force and published by KOEI, the same developer and publisher of the famous Shin Sangoku Musou (Dynasty Warriors) series. As with the original Samurai Warriors, Samurai Warriors 2 is based on the Japanese Sengoku or Warring States period, a time of social upheaval, political intrigue, and nearly constant military conflict in Japan that lasted roughly from the middle of the 15th century to the beginning of the 17th century. The game is a third person hack-and-slash. You have 26 playable characters to choose from. Once you choose your character you are tossed into massive real-time battles, with the object being to help claim victory for your army by defeating key enemy officers, or simply slaying a large amount of enemy troops, which will boost the morale of your army, and turn the tides of the battle. 10 new warriors are added from the previous game including the legendary Musashi Miyamoto, the unifier of Japan Ieyasu Tokugawa, and the enigmatic ninja Kotaro Fuma. Each warrior has his own unique move set and techniques. Set traps, summon ninja decoys, and more. Use powerful Linked Charge attacks and power up to three Musou gauges. Now castle warfare blends seamlessly with field combat. Take control of castles on the battlefield to gain a significant morale advantage. There are multiple game modes including Story, Free, and Survival modes. Team up with friends for two-player Co-op play or compete with them at Sugoroku, a bonus party game for up to four players.</story>

    <story>Samurai Gojiro Kiryuu comes to the American West in search of his brother. His journey takes him to a corrupt town ruled by a sinister land baron named Goldberg. Though Gojiro isn&apos;t interested in righting wrongs, he is soon caught up in the town&apos;s problems- killing highway robbers, protecting a woman from would-be rapists, and thwarting Goldberg&apos;s machinations. Focused on destroying Gojiro, Goldberg unleashes an endless stream of minions... all fodder for Gojiro&apos;s blade. But Goldberg has an ace up his sleeve... Samurai Western is a third-person action game. Gojiro&apos;s blade is more than a match for Old West weaponry as he can ably deflect or sidestep bullets. As Gojiro completes levels, he upgrades his skills, unlocks new swords and stances, and adds Western accessories to his wardrobe. Primarily a single-player game, Samurai Western has a two player co-op mode and unlockable characters for both modes.</story>

As a member of the special operations force of your choice, you will undergo four training exercises - arms, physical training, siege training, and defensive tactics - before being placed into the field to deal with a number of hostage situations. The sieges, true to Davilex&apos;s knack of using real-life locations, all take place in real locations, beginning with 10 Downing Street, and moving along to the French Elysée and the German Kanzleramt. Although you could be forgiven for believing that this game wants to be realistic looking at the use of real services and real locales, this game makes no claims as such. In fact, arcade action is the order of the day here, and while the real SAS, GIGN and GSG9 are busy with discreet, minimal casualty operations, here you&apos;ll be blasting away with aplomb.</story>

    <story>Savage Skies is an aerial dragon combat game for the PlayStation 2. This fantasy themed game has wide range of features, that provide a robust single player game, split-screen multiplayer, and special modes, missions, and creatures that can be unlocked. The story of Savage Skies centers around the death a powerful king struck down by the demons of a vengeful necromancer banished from the kingdom years earlier. With the king&apos;s soul magically shattered, and the land in turmoil, the player is challenged to restore the throne by winning the war for one of three factions in the game - the noble Virtwyn, the mutated Chrysalis, or the necromantic Pariah. Mission based animations and voiceovers provide the story elements to the player as the game unfolds. Gameplay borrows loosely from other 3D aerial combat/shooter&apos;eque games like Starfighter, Flying Hereos and DragonStrike, but has it&apos;s own twists, like advanced super maneuvers and power-ups. Core to Savage Skies is the ability to unlock and try many different creatures (up to 24) in both the single and multiplayer portions of the game. Each creature has strengths and weaknesses like speed, manuverability, offensive and defensive powers, that can be leveraged during the campaign missions. Savage Skies also features fun 2 player split screen action with 7 unique multiplayer maps and 3 multiplayer modes.</story>

Once here, they are discovered by Bobby who is captured and questioned about Leon’s work. Bobby manages to escape and is teleported to their world where the story takes place. Scaler is an action platform game in which you control Bobby Jenkins who turns to Scaler in the “bizarre dimension” and tries to stop the evil Looger and his cronies. Along your adventure you will come across friends and foes like Leon who gives you advice and guidance and “Captain Bootcamp” who is Looger’s right hand lackey. Travel through 15 colorful levels riding vines and crawling walls as you hunt and defeat Looger and his team. Scaler has lots of abilities like climbing walls to reach new areas and riding vines to charge up your electric bomb attack. Use camouflage to sneak by deadly traps and confuse your enemies. Attack with your tongue or use your claw attack, which you can upgrade during the game. Use the Electric Bomb attack several enemies at once. Scaler can transform into some of the enemies he defeats after defeating enough of them and use the special abilities of that creature. Break open cocoons and shells to collect Klokkies and Crystal Gems which in turn can be used to get new abilities and upgrade existing ones. If you collect 100 Crystal Gems in the game you will get an alternate ending. Collect Lizard Eggs to unlock more levels and to keep Looger form mutating them into monsters.

    <story>Miami in the &apos;80s- gangs, drugs and hookers dominate the scene and a Cuban called Tony Montana rises up to be the most powerful drug dealer, controlling the whole of Miami. This is the story of the 1983 movie Scarface in which Tony Montana dies during a attack from a rival gang on his mansion at the end. The game now puts the player in the shoes of Tony a few moments before the gang hits his office. After he successfully defends his mansion, his empire lies in ruins. But Tony wouldn&apos;t be Tony Montana if he would just give up, so it is the player&apos;s goal to reclaim Miami once again. To do so, he has to earn money and respect. The only way to earn money in Miami is to deal drugs. At the beginning the stuff is bought in small amounts and personally sold to the dealers. Eventually, however, Tony can set up so-called Fronts which are legitimate shops (like a car seller) in which drugs are sold in very large amounts. By overtaking Fronts, Tony also increases his control over the current district of Miami. To completely overtake one part of town, all the enemy gangs scattered around in small groups must be eliminated. After a deal, Tony has to launder the money at the local bank and have it transferred to his account. He then can buy exotics for his mansion like an expensive vase or a new car with a driver. When talking with a dealer or trying to get cop heat down, the player has to play a mini-game that determines if Tony is successful and if so, how much he gets for the drugs or how much heat he loses. Respect is earned by increasing Tony&apos;s territory, buying exotics and earning balls in fights and while driving. The enemies have different target zones which give a different amount of balls on a hit. This also fills up Tony&apos;s &apos;ball-meter. Once this is full he can enter a kind of god mode in which he is invulnerable and has unlimited ammo. Tony also gets health when killing someone in this mode. If he is driving a car he gets balls when making stunts like driving on the wrong side of the road or dodging an incoming car. As in Grand Theft Auto- Vice City, the player is free to roam the city of Miami and there are also some side-missions with racing events.</story>

    <story>Fred brings the rest of Mystery, Inc. along to meet his cousin, Jed, who works at the Monstrous Fright &amp; Magic. MFM is a special effects company that creates monster costumes with a special formula they invented called, “Mubber”, that makes the costumes seems so real that the wearer literally becomes the actual monster. When they arrive, they found the location in shambles. Winslow Stanton, the creator of Mubber and owner of MFM, told them someone has stolen the Mubber formula and by using it with their animatrons, destroyed the building and disappeared. He believes it is Jed’s doing because he, too, disappeared. Looks like it’s up to Scooby and the gang to find Jed, destroy the costumed monsters and unmask the truth behind this great mystery! In Scooby-Doo! Unmasked, you will guide Scooby to help Mystery, Inc. uncover clues, fight monsters and occasionally save your friends from danger. You will be visiting many several worlds including a China Town and a museum. You will encounter various monsters like the Chinese Zombie and the Black Knight and the only way to get past them is by attacking them with your spin, slide, roll and smash attacks! Also, by collecting mubbers, you can create special costumes that will give you special powers. For example, with the Kung Fu Costume, you will be able to move around with greater agility and force. Be sure to watch your health level which is indicated by the number of Scooby Medals you have. If you reach zero, you will restart at the last save point but you can restore your health by collecting enough Scooby snacks that can be found throughout the game. Also, by collecting food items you can get Shaggy to cook you a special meal that will increase the total number of medals you have. In each world, when you’ve collected enough clues, Velma will ask you a few questions in order to figure out who is behind everything, and you must select the clues that you feel will answer these questions. When that’s completed, you will have to fight a boss before Velma will reveal who the identity of the villain. Scooby-Doo! Unmasked can be saved at any point in the game simply by selecting Save Game in the Pause Menu. You can also turn on the Autosave function which will enable the game to automatically save at different points. You can replay any level as many times as you want so you can collect any missing items you still lack. In the extra menu, you will find Bonus Arts that features various conceptual art pieces used in the making of the game.</story>

    <story>Sea Monsters is based on the National Geographic CGI documentary of the same name, where earth&apos;s underwater world from millions of years ago is portrayed as a dangerous environment with different kinds of predators keeping the ecosystem intact. Players take command of six different prehistoric marine reptiles, each with their own skills and weaknesses. A large part is spent on exploration. The creatures need to hunt prey, avoid or defeat foes, unlock hidden challenges and eventually find a way to escape the dangerous waters. Creatures are controlled through the stylus to move them around. They can dodge with a quick tap (DS) or a swing (Wii) and go into combat mode to lock on targets and attack. Next to regular attacks, the creature can dodge an incoming attack and a bite icon appears. Quickly select it and the next attack will be much stronger. Some monsters have special abilities, activated by tapping the sonar icon in the bottom left corner when it becomes visible. This allows them to swim stealthily, dig, break rocks or jump. The creature&apos;s status is tracked through three parameters- health (hunger), stamina and oxygen. Health and stamina can be replenished by eating small creatures, while oxygen requires a regular trip to the surface. Creatures cannot dive deeper than fifty feet underwater. The bottom screen shows a large sonar. Dangerous monsters are bright red spots, food is green, collectible fossils are yellow (used to unlock new monsters) and portals are blue. Some fossils can only be found by defeating monsters or by completing challenges. Through their abilities, new monsters get access to new areas in the open sea, which serves as a hub. There are also a few wildcard fossils to move on to unlock any monster. The Wii and DS version are almost completely identical, but the Wii version also contains a multiplayer mode where players can race against friends in five different challenge zones.</story>

Combat mostly takes place by giving your ships orders before the battle (combined with the combat roles of the ships which you assigned in the design phase), and then watching in 3rd person mode as your ships fight the battle. You earn money by completing missions and making sure you don&apos;t loose to many ships, the money can then be used to purchase hulls, weapons and subsystems to build new ships.</story>

    <story>Sega&apos;s many franchises come together for a tennis tournament spanning the varied worlds created by them in the last twenty years. Sixteen characters over fifteen different Sega game series are represented, as are ten different courts based on those same franchises. Exhibition and Tournament modes are included in the game. The first is a simple vs mode, whereas the tournament allows the player to unlock new characters and courts over a series of matches and other challenges, all related to tennis but also drawing heavily on the video game represented. Singles and doubles can be played by either humans or AI, with the player being able to choose his or her doubles partner. Version differences are notable, as the Wii game misses out on online play in exchange for three different control modes utilising the Wii Remote (much like in Wii Sports tennis, the Wii Remote and nunchuck or the Classic Controller. Online play is included in the 360 and PS3 versions. Each character has a special move to aid them with their tennis match, relating to the character. For example, Beat from Jet Set Radio has a power that allows the ball to grind against the net and shoot off at a random point, making it difficult to return. Minigames are included as both one-offs and part of the tournament. These include a Target-hitting game, The House of the Dead zombie killing game (hit moving zombies around a court before the timer runs out), a Space Harrier game, a Puyo Puyo game, a Virtua Cop game and a Samba De Amigo-related game.</story>

    <story>After many years of silence, Sensible Soccer has returned. As with the original 1992 game, Sensible Soccer 2006 is a fast-paced football game viewed from a bird&apos;s perspective (although the camera has been slightly tilted). The control has gone from one button to three buttons, as you use one for shooting, another for passing and the third for sprinting. In addition to that you use the stick on gamepads to aim and to apply the famous after-touch. The game contains a total of around 350 different teams (international and club teams) and 50 preset competitions. If that is not enough, players can create their own custom teams. This is the career mode of the game. The objective is to create a squad of rookie players and take them to the top of the team rankings. As you succeed you will earn skill points that can be used to increase the quality of your team. Sensible Soccer 2006 offers multiplayer matches (no online play though) for up to four players at once (in which two players share the control of a team). Another feature left from the original game is the possibility for players to create their own competitions - leagues, cups and tournaments.</story>

    <story>Shadow Hearts II is a direct sequel to the unusual console-style RPG set in a real world and in a concrete epoch. It is 1915, and war raises its ugly head to greet the nations of Europe. Half a year after the events described in the first game, the young Yuri Hyuga finds himself in a small French village under attack of German soldiers. But soldiers are not the only threat that awaits him- a mysterious magician that seems to have a personal grudge against the hero appears on the scene. Accompanied by friends who follow him for various reasons, Yuri will travel all over Europe and to the Far East, and once again face his own past. Shadow Hearts II implements a combat system that is similar to the first game- the Judgment Ring, an arcade addition to strategic combat, is still there, along with Yuri&apos; special ability to transform into monsters and to visit the graveyard for more powerful fusion variants. The Sanity Points system from the first game is also present. Character upgrading is now more flexible (you can assign different magic spells to characters), and you can also team up to perform combo attacks.</story>

    <story>The year is 1929. America is threatened by a mysterious evil power. Pale green distortions in the sky, called windows, spawn vicious monsters. Johnny Garland is a young man who has lost his family and his memory in a terrible accident. It turns out that he inherited a fortune from his father, but he is not interested in money, but in re-discovering his own past. For that reason, Johnny becomes a private investigator. He receives an assignment which involves capturing an escaped convict. During the investigation, Johnny meets Shania, a native American woman who works as a monster-hunter. From that point on, the destinies of the two are linked together... This installment of the Shadow Hearts series utilizes almost the same gameplay system as Shadow Hearts- Covenant. The turn-based battles are once again controlled by the Judgment Ring- you must stop a spinning indicator on a colored segment of a ring in order to execute a successful attack. New in this game are combo attacks which the players can execute through special areas of the Judgment Ring.</story>

    <story>Shadow Hearts is a console-style RPG set in a historical period- China and Europe of 1913, one year before the World War. The game&apos;s hero is Yuri Hyuga, a young harmonixer- a man who possesses the power of transforming into demons. He meets Alice Elliot, a young British girl whose father was brutally murdered, and who is chased by a mysterious warlock who calls himself Roger Bacon. Yuri and Alice travel through the pre-war China, dealing with demons, evil magicians, and Japanese occupation army. The journey eventually takes them and their friends to Europe, where they have to confront their ultimate enemy, but also uncover the truth about their own pasts. Shadow Hearts implements traditional turn-based combat style for the battles, adding to it a feature called Judgment Ring. Every time you perform an attack a ring with a spinning arrow appears on the top of the screen. If you hit a critical area on the ring, your attack will be more powerful. However, missing a hit area will cancel the attack. Various types of attack have rings of various difficulty; usually, the more powerful a spell is, the smaller the hit area is on the ring. The Judgment Ring is also used for other purposes; it can help you reduce prices in stores, and is needed to solve many puzzles.</story>

Suddenly, a tremendous blow darkens the sight of his eyes, and the next thing he can see is a very strange room filled with bizarre objects, and a voice talking to him from nowhere. Who are you? asks Eike, Perhaps Satan himself? And where am I? Am I dead? You are dead, indeed, answers the mysterious voice, but you can prevent it. Destiny can be changed, you know. And with this, the voice disappears, leaving Eike in the strange room with a mysterious time-traveling device. Eike doesn&apos;t quite understand what&apos;s going on. He knows one thing- in order to survive, he has to change the past, to make it impossible for the murderer to kill him. And so, the battle for survival begins. The murderer will find many ways to kill Eike, and in order to prevent this, Eike will have to travel to thirty years in the past, to the beginning of the 20th century, and to the Middle Ages. But the connections between the past and the present are stronger than Eike thinks. With no guidance but the mysterious voice, Eike has to explore Lebensbaum in various time periods, and solve the mystery. Shadow of Destiny is a pure adventure game. There are no action elements in the game, but each chapter has a time limit, during which Eike has to find a way to prevent the murderer from killing him.</story>

He seeks the Dormin, a strange and God-like being that resides there. The Dormin is surprised that the man carries an ancient and magical sword, and speaks to the man. The man pleas for his help in bringing back the woman&apos;s cursed soul, however the being says it is the law of mortals that a dead soul cannot be brought back. He does say though, that if the man is willing to accept some heavy consequences, that there might be a way to revive her. But it will not be easy. Our hero must embark on a quest to slay 16 colossi, giant creatures that tower hundreds of feet above the Earth. Using his ancient sword and his horse Agro, he must travel across the immense landscape seeking the colossi to save his love. Taking the form of various animals and other bipedal creatures, these colossi are tough and fierce. Their skin is tougher than leather, and the armor they wear is literally rock. However, by using his ancient sword, the man can penetrate the weak spot on them and destroy the towering beings and free his love&apos;s soul. Shadow of the Colossus is set in the same universe as ICO, by the same development studio, and it is a prequel to the game.</story>

The game is played by first collecting spirits of defeated opponents, then using them to help Yoh in battle. Other so-called &apos;Guardian Ghosts&apos; are summoned to fight alongside Yoh. As he fights, Yoh gains experience points to increase his powers, and those of the Guardian Ghosts. New moves, special attacks and combinations of attacks are the reward for skill and perseverance. With Shaman King&apos;s popularity soaring around the world, the UK is about to get a hit of what is threatening to become the next animated super show. Can the ghosts and spirits help our hero become the Shaman King? </story>

    <story>Shaun White Snowboarding- Road Trip is a separate release from the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions called Shaun White Snowboarding. Making full use of the Wii Balance Board accessory, Road Trip allows players to hit the slopes in a more dynamic way. By using the Balance Board as a virtual snowboard, players can ride the various runs and perform tricks and other techniques such as carving, grinding and speed-boosting. As with many snowboarding games, there are numerous riders with various skills and abilities to unlock and choose from. But unique to this title is the choice of a cameraman companion. This second character films your run from behind you and also provides a particular momentary power-up. This may be a Speed Boost, Jump Boost or Trick Boost etc. On your road trip, you will visit many locations and continents. In a sense, you&apos;re following the trail of Shaun White himself. This is demonstrated when he makes occasional calls to your mobile phone and updates you on his new location. You&apos;re physically one location behind him, and need to complete certain runs and objectives in order to progress to the next location, whether it is Canada, Japan, Switzerland and many other exotic and snow-capped places. The game also supports play without the use of the Balance Board and requires motion-gesture input from the Wii remote. Various motions correspond to certain tricks and manoeuvres while button combinations alter the motions to achieve more advanced trick techniques.</story>

    <story>Shellshock takes you back to the dark years in Vietnam, in one of the most controversial wars ever fought. You take on the role of a rookie soldier on his first tour of duty. Using a third-person perspective, you experience napalm bombardments of civilian villages, sneaky night missions along the river banks, claustrophobic tunnel systems and huge battles in temples and open fields. Most missions are played as a team, but your team members cannot die and do no influence the mission objectives. You will have to assassinate enemy generals, take out crucial boats and guide your team through unknown territory. The game does not have drivable vehicles, multiplayer options or extensive environmental interaction, but it features an interesting system of dismantling the many bombs and traps- in a race against time, you have to perform a long key sequence in the correct order to clear the path. The atrocities on both sides are clearly shown in the cutscenes, filmed as through a shaky hand-camera. Either side is not afraid to abuse civilians for their cause and this sense of realism gives the game a rather raw edge. You can even purchase the services of hookers in the base camp. The game was originally developed for the PS2 and then ported to the Xbox and PC. To add to the atmosphere, songs from Lee Hooker, Percy Sledge, Status Quo, The Monkeys and many more, were licensed.</story>

    <story>For many years, the members of the Kuzunoha family have been skillful detectives, specializing in supernatural cases. They have mastered the secret of devil summoning - call forth beasts from hell and make them fight against their own kind, on your side. This unique ability was transferred from parent to child over generations. It is the Taishou era in Japan- the First World War is over, and the country enters rapid industrialization, growing to become one of the leading economies in the world. You play as the fourteenth Raidou Kuzunoha, and one seemingly ordinary case makes you confront a demon. That&apos;s where your newly discovered devil-summoning skills come in handy. After defeating your first demonic enemy and summoning your first allies, you are determined to explore the city, to solve supernatural cases, and to find the truth behind the demons&apos; presence. This is the third entry in the Devil Summoner sub-series of the Megaten franchise. Unlike the two previous games, Raidou Kuzunoha incorporates action combat into the traditional demon-summoning system. You can still capture and summon various demons, but they will be controlled by AI (which you can configure) during battles. You have physical control over Raidou Kuzunoha; although the battles take place on separate screens, like in usual turn-based Asian RPGs, you can move freely and attack enemies in real time. You can use sword or gun attacks, and also perform different moves such as dashing and striking the opponent. You can also defend by pressing buttons at the correct time. Outside of battles, you will have to do a lot of detective work- walking around the city, talking to suspects, hunting for information, etc. Some demon abilities can also be used outside of combat to gain advantage in your investigation.</story>

    <story>The events of this game occur shortly after the ones described in the first installment of the series. Once again, the player takes the role of Raidou Kuzunoha the 14th, the youngest in the long line of devil summoners. It is the Taishou period (the 1920-ies) in Japan, and once again the Capital City is threatened by supernatunal forces. Raidou works undercover at the Narumi Detective Agency, solving cases with mysterious backgrounds. It all begins when a young woman enters the office and asks the detective to find a missing man... The game is part of the larger series dedicated to generations of devil summoners, which, in its turn, is a part of the meta-series Megaten. As in the first Raidou Kuzunoha game, the core gameplay is action-oriented. Raidou attacks enemies with swords or guns; but like before, he will need help from his demonic allies to defeat the foes. Raidou is able to summon two (as opposed to one in the first game) demons to help him in battles. The main gameplay difference is that instead of simply weakening enemies to capture them, as it was the case in the first game, now Raidou has to talk to hostile demons and persuade them to join his party, thus returning to the long-running Megaten tradition of demon negotiations as integral part of gameplay.</story>

People are divided into tribes that constantly fight each other in order to become the strongest in Junkyard. For only the strongest, the champion of Junkyard, can set on a journey to find Nirvana - a legendary land that is just the opposite of the sinister Junkyard. Serph is a fighter of a tribe called Embryon. Like all the others, he also wants to become the champion and to reach Nirvana. One day a mysterious object called The Pod appears. Serph and his friends are affected by its lights, and a result they find out they have gained supernatural, demonic powers. This is when Serph&apos;s quest truly begins. Digital Devil Saga is a part of Megaten game universe, related to Shin Megami Tensei and Persona. Unlike all other Megaten games, you can&apos;t communicate with random enemies (demons) by talking to them, and also can&apos;t summon them in battles. Instead, Serph and his party are able to turn into demons themselves. During the round-based combat, the characters can fight as demons or as humans (using guns). The most important combat element is the ability to devour defeated foes. Each devoured enemy adds to your karma points, which can later be assigned to learn various skills.</story>

    <story>The first Shin Megami Tensei game officially released outside of Japan, this is the English translation of what is known in Japan as Shin Megami Tensei III- Nocturne Maniax, an enhanced version of the original Shin Megami Tensei III. The third installment of the most important series within Megaten Universe, SMT- Nocturne continues the tradition of post-apocalyptic setting with demonic overtones that became the trademark of the series. You play as a high-school student in modern Tokyo. One day you go to visit your teacher in a hospital. Unable to find her, you encounter a strange man in the basement, and soon thereafter witness the event of great destruction - the Conception. The world around the young man changes drastically, as monsters invade it, and the high demonic powers of the universe make it to the arena of their eternal fight - the struggle between Law and Chaos. Will the hero be able to find his path within this cosmic battle, even at the cost of losing his human nature? Just like the two previous Shin Megami Tensei games, SMT- Nocturne allows you to communicate with random enemies and to recruit them into your party. The fights are turn-based, and are viewed from third-person perspective, unlike in earlier SMT games. The exploration of 3D dungeons is also done from over-the-shoulder view. True to the spirit of SMT series, you can choose your own moral path in the game, siding with one of the struggling forces, or fighting against both. New in this enhanced version (compared to the Japanese-only Shin Megami Tensei III) are- additional items and monsters, optional dungeons, two difficulty levels, an extra ending (in additional to the other five possible), and the appearance of Dante, the popular character from Devil May Cry series.</story>

    <story>Having lost your parents as a child, you lived in the suburbs with your relatives, until they decided to send you to a high school located on an island near the port city Iwatodai. But as you attempt to enter your new dormitory, you are attacked by a mysterious creature. As a result, you discover within yourself the gift to call upon a higher being, Persona, that grants you immense power. Your new ability makes you decide to investigate the strange world of shadows that has been plaguing the city every midnight, and to find out who or what is behind it. This sequel in the Persona series, which is part of the huge Megaten franchise, is not directly connected to its predecessors story-wise. The gameplay has also underwent significant changes, throwing an element of school simulation into the already unusual Megaten RPG formula. You get to live the life of a normal high-school student- you attend classes, talk to your friends, get homework, wait for the summer vacation, and so on. The game is divided into school days with their own schedule. However, at midnight the real world freezes, and only you and your friends with the unique Persona abilities can feel the time flowing as they battle the shadows. The battles follow the classic Megaten model of demon-summoning. You can either attack with your weapons, or call a mighty Persona from within yourself. After the battle is won, you receive Persona cards, which can be fused to get more powerful Personae. Inspired by the system used in Shin Megami Tensei- Nocturne, you are able to hit enemies&apos; weakpoints with your magic spells. Taking advantage of these weakpoints means that you can perform devastating combo attacks while the enemy is weakened.</story>

Raising the rank of these social links increases the potency of the personae associated with them. Personae are shadows of people which are used in battle to unleash special powers. All battles are fought in a variety of dungeons inside of the TV. Each person kidnapped creates a new dungeon particular to them. You also have to balance your crime-solving and social linking with studying, clubs, and job responsibilities.</story>

    <story>Shining Force EXA is an entry in the Shining Force series, but unlike most of the earlier titles it has a more action-oriented RPG approach, rather than featuring turn-based strategy gameplay. The game uses a real-time combat system, an art system for special character, weapons, and an armor upgrade system. As such it is considered the spiritual successor to Shining Force NEO inheriting many of the game&apos;s traits. Players choose to be either the warrior Toma or the sorceress Cyrille. They are almost immediately joined by the knight Gadfort and the elfin archer Maebelle. They all have different reasons to join the quest and find the holy sword Shining Force. The main storyline focuses on the devastating war between humans and demons. The game takes place in a world divided into two kingdoms- The Noswald Empire (humans) and Fyrlandt (demons). The player&apos;s base of operations is the Geo-Fortress which is a mobile base, and along the way there is the ability to upgrade the fortress. This is done by collecting rare material which allows the fortress to be upgraded to three forms, each time more powerful. Only in the final form it becomes possible to travel around. The strategy elements center around the fortress. Players can make room for shops, train party members and choose who to take along on quests. It can also be attacked and needs to be defended.</story>

Interestingly, the companion you pick changes Xion to the opposite &apos;soul&apos; dark or light due to the nature of the Twin Dragon Rings, with correspondingly different powers. Single players have their companion AI to help them out of tight spots, too.</story>

    <story>Shinobido- Way of the Ninja is stealth-action game, that is comparable to the well known Tenchu series. The gameplay&apos;s main idea is to complete your missions without being noticed by guards, watchdogs or even harmless townsmen. Carefully approaching of your enemies from behind is crucial, because your character isn&apos;t very capable in direct combat. A huge difference in comparison to Tenchu is, that the game is widely non-linear, which means that you can choose the missions you want to participate in at almost any given time. There are three landlords for whom you can accept missions. Depending on your choices the trust of each landlord in you increases or decreases. The game allows you to use alchemy, by which you can create your own equipment like strength potions and smoke bombs. Shinobido also gives you your own hideout, around which you can place decoration like various trees as well as traps to strike back invading enemies. The story takes place in the Japanese province of Utakata in the 16th century. You take on the role of the ninja Goh, the sole survivor of the Azuka Clan, who finds himself unconsciously lying near a river having completely lost his memory. After finding a magical stone containing tiny fragments of the events that took place before his awakening, he decides that the only way to find out more about his past is to localize the remaining stones.</story>

    <story>Shox is an arcade racing game with rally cars and offroad courses. There is exactly one playing mode for single players- the league. There are four leagues with increasing difficulty and six races each - to get access to the next league the player has to be number one in average after all six races. But there is one special gimmick- the shox zones. There are three of those zones per race and the player has to drive through them as fast as possible. If he gets the gold medal in all three a shock wave manifests which makes controlling the car difficult - the goal is to stay in touch with this wave as long as possible. All those accomplishments reward money which is reinvested into new cars (which are divided into four classes). But the player has to be careful- every impact with opponents or the edge results in a fee. Money can be faster earned by making a bet where the player has to race against one opponent. The cars are licensed and the courses are divided into three locations- Arctic Tundra, Arid Desert, and Asian Jungle</story>

All the regular Shrek crew is included, such as Shrek, Donkey, Fiona, and Puss n&apos; Boots, along with some newcomers such as Cap&apos;n Hook, the Black Knight, and Quasimodo the Hunchback. Each character has their own special moves that capture the humor of the franchise (such as Shrek&apos;s Green Storm gas bombs), and the environments are colorful, filled with odd weapons, and highly destructible. Players have the option of following a story mode (where Donkey tells his half-breed Donkey kids a strange bedtime story), or just participating in straight-up brawls or minigame-like challenges. Multiplayer, of course, is a big focus on the game, and it allows up to 4 players to slam each other all day long.</story>

    <story>Silent Hill- 0rigins is a prequel to the Silent Hill series set in the 1970s. You play as trucker Travis Grady, who attempts to take a shortcut through Silent Hill late one night when running behind on his rounds. As in the previous Silent Hill games, you move back and forth between nightmare and real versions of the town, here crawling through mirrors to get between. He must gather items used to solve puzzles and open up new areas. Monsters of various types provide obstacles and, in series tradition, are mostly disturbingly twisted versions of humanity. Travis can fight with his bare fists or use melee weapons. Unlike previous games in the series, melee weapons break after a time. There are also one-shot items that can be thrown and several guns. Combat is performed through lock-on. There is no HUD, but the edge of the screen turns red when Travis is near death.</story>

New to the series are a depiction of Silent Hill&apos;s demonic alter-dimension as a world of ice, and the removal of weapons from the game - when the monsters come out, Harry must literally run for his life. Between scenes, the game will cut to a psychiatrist&apos;s office, who asks you personal questions about yourself and your past experiences. The game will then alter itself based on your responses, changing characters and lines of dialog to something intended to be more personally uncomfortable. As you search for Cheryl, you will come across objects and recordings that tell some of the history of Silent Hill. The Wii Remote controls a flashlight aimed in real-time. Harry&apos;s cell phone accepts calls and messages from both the real and the supernatural, and a camera function is used to uncover hidden ghosts and their messages.</story>

On one strange night, Henry has a terrible nightmare, with recurring events; his phone is dead, his windows are sealed, and his neighbors can&apos;t hear him. He looks at his door, only to see it is blocked by several, thick metal chains. A note is pinned to the door- &amp;quot;Don&apos;t go out!&amp;quot; It is signed only by a man named Walter. Henry explores his apartment, trying to figure out what is happening, when he spots a giant hole in the wall of his bathroom. Henry goes through the hole, only to find a portal which leads him to alternate dimensions. Hopefully, Henry will find out the truth about his apartment, Room 302, and live. Silent Hill 4- The Room is similar to past games in terms of atmosphere. The game is dark and foreboding, never letting you know what&apos;s behind the next corner or down the street. SH4 takes the series in a new direction, with multiple new features. First and foremost is never actually leaving your apartment. You utilize a strange portal to travel to alternate dimensions, including a hospital, a cult command center deep in the forest, and a prison. Aside from the traditional third-person-view, there is now a first-person mode, which is used to control Henry when he is in his apartment. The game has a feature that, whenever you look at something of importance, an eyeball will appear to tell you that you can interact with it. The previous games have mostly been about exploring the town and solving puzzles, but Silent Hill 4 has much more combat involved. There are more enemies in a given area, and more narrow areas and cramped spaces. To help you in combat, you&apos;ve got the standard arsenal of Silent Hill games, such as the steel pipe, pistol, and new to this game, a golf club.</story>

They also have powers that can only be used at specific trigger points, such as Bart catching updrafts with his cape, Homer inflating himself with helium, Lisa summoning the hand of Buddha to move objects, and Marge sending Maggie into crawlspaces. The abilities are upgraded throughout the game. Each character also has an item they can pick up which will make them temporarily invulnerable, and give them unlimited special attacks for this period. The game is divided into a series of sixteen episodes, each a parody of a popular game or genre; these episodes have names like Medal of Homer or Neverquest. Each level features two or more of the Simpson clan. Players must switch back and forth using each family members&apos; unique powers to complete each level. Alternatively, most platforms also allow two-player cooperative play.</story>

    <story>In The Simpsons Skateboarding, players take the four members of the Simpsons family plus Otto, Chief Wiggum, Professor Frink, Nelson and Krusty the Clown to ten skating locations around Springfield. Gameplay is similar to the Tony Hawk series, though the trick system is slightly different with some moves involving Street-Fighteresque quarter rolls of the d-pad. Each level has three kinds of objectives. Skillz school mode has challenges that involve doing specific tricks. There are five untimed goals and a final timed goal in each level. At first it serves as a tutorial of sorts, but it gets difficult later on. In skatefest, players are assigned five goals per level. Each level has one goal where you spell a word, one where you collect items, one where you find clocks in something similar to a checkpoint race and two miscellaneous goals. The final mode is a timed trick contest mode, where the objective is to get a given score within a time limit. All of these modes earn money, which is used to upgrade the characters&apos; skating abilities. There are also various secret items to find or to unlock by completing objectives.</story>

    <story>The Simpsons- Hit &amp; Run can be best described as Grand Theft Auto in Springfield. The player takes on the role of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa or Apu and try to uncover a mystery surrounding mechanical bees that are taking over Springfield, mysterious vans, and cola that can control the minds of those who drink it. Like GTA, the game follows a linear-based path through fifty plus missions. The player will have to chase cars and find out where they&apos;re headed, grab all the spilling cola cans before people can drink them, and chasing down villains before they get away. Throughout the course of the game, the player can unlock tons of rewards by completing missions in a set amount of time or performing outstanding stunts. All voiceovers are performed by those who act in the show, including Dan Castellaneta (Homer), Julie Kavner (Marge) and Yeardley Smith (Lisa). The game supports multiplayer action for up to four players.</story>

    <story>Following the way of the original SingStar game, this continuation boosts up the fun with even more songs. Sing solo or as a party, try out the battle mode or reach the high score in a duet. And if you&apos;re not in the mood to be judged, just go on for the freestyle mode and sing along the music video. And if you&apos;re not familiar with the lyrics, don&apos;t sweat it &apos;cos it&apos;s the pitch of your voice that&apos;s taken into consideration. You can buy this game with or without the two microphones, assuming you have the original SingStar game already. 30 more tracks that are added are- 1. Alicia Keys - Fallin&apos; Ashford &amp; Simpson - Solid Bill Withers - Ain&apos;t No Sunshine Blu Cantrell - Hit &apos;em Up Style Bob Marley - No Woman No Cry Buggles - Video Killed the Radio Star Busted - Year 3000 Cyndi Lauper - Girls Just Wanna Have Fun Destiny&apos;s Child - Survivor Dido - White Flag Duran Duran - Hungry Like the Wolf Elton John &amp; Kiki Dee - Don&apos;t Go Breaking My Heart Elvis - Way Down Franz Ferdinand - Take Me Out George Michael - Faith Jamiroquai - Cosmic Girl Javine - Real Things Kylie Minogue - I Should Be So Lucky Little Richard - Tutti Frutti Maroon5 - This Love Natasha Bedingfield - Single Pink - Just Like a Pill Scissor Sisters - Take Your Mamma Sonny &amp; Cher - I Got You Babe Spandau Ballet - Gold Spice Girls - Who Do You Think You Are The Beautiful South - A Little Time The Foundations - Build Me Up Buttercup The Police - Every Breath You Take Tiffany - I Think We&apos;re Alone Now</story>

    <story>Siren is a Japanese survival horror game which takes place in a small town where almost all of the people were killed. A siren in the small Japanese village of Hanuda suddenly turns its inhabitants into shibito, zombies bent on turning everybody else into shibito. The player alternates gameplay between ten different characters trying to avoid the shibito. It&apos;s like a puzzle. The player has to learn the shibitos&apos; patterns and learn to avoid getting seen, as all of the characters have very low maximum health. The player can also sightjack other characters and shibito to see from their point of view.</story>

    <story>Aerospace technology has linked the world together; introducing speedy planes, high flying airships and massive flying fortresses. Because of air piracy and other dangers, the occupation of Skygunners have appeared. Part freelancer and part mercenary, they are often hired for their daring skills in the air. Ciel and Copain are two such Skygunners, relaxing at the town of Rive. The police chief of Rive asks the two gunners to act as security for the town&apos;s scientific expo, and assigns his agent Femme to the group as well. What seems like a simple babysitting task soon turns to adventure when the criminal scientific genius, Ventre shows up, with his gang of loyal Poulet doll-henchmen. As Ventre orchestrates the theft of the Eternal Engine, a perpetual motion machine that could forever power his inventions, it&apos;s up to Ciel, Copain and Femme to take to the skies and foil Ventre&apos;s plans. SkyGunner is a 3rd person flight combat game, with its emphasis on action. Players choose to take the role of either Ciel, Copain or Femme, each with their own campaign and unique flying abilities and special skill. Players can turn the plane&apos;s direction up, down, left and right, perform barrel rolls, use afterburners and breaking. Weaponry is handled by a complex system of targeting, with involves two types- &amp;quot;Look Targeting&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Weapon Lock&amp;quot;. Look Targeting simply assigns a particular enemy as the center of the camera and can be switched between at any time. The player must still maneuver near the enemy and target them with the cross hairs in order to fire on them. Depending on the secondary weapon selected, players can roll the cross hairs over the wing leader of an enemy group or the sequentially lead gun on a battleship, allowing the player to instantly target multiples from that group. The primary weapon of each airplane is a machine gun which fires straight ahead. More destructive secondary weapons are also available, and include Fireworks Missiles which create area explosions, Dog Missiles which slow and/or immobilize targets and Cross Missiles which stick to targets and need to be shot by a machine gun to detonate. Copain also has his own weapon, the Pumpkin Bomb which is a big destructive bomb. These secondary weapons are automatically replenished with the destruction of chains of enemies and/or combos. Chains/Combos are also the way to activate score multipliers, which affect the amount of money won in each mission. Ciel, Copain and Femme are continually in competition throughout the game and often bonuses (such as faster engines) are given to the character with the highest score in specific missions. Bonus scores are also awarded for specific mission events.</story>

But certain missions require the special abilities of Bentley, who is smart and can drop bombs, as well shoot enemies from a distance. Other missions require the muscles of Murray, who can lift nearly everything, including enemies. The main goal of the game is the retrieval of a number of clockwork pieces from different locations around the world. Each theft has to be prepared with a number of sub-missions which have to be completed before the &apos;real thing&apos; can begin.</story>

    <story>Sly and the gang is back in this third outing of Sly Raccoon-series. This time, the story takes the boys (Sly, Bentley and Murray) to the fortress that houses the treasures of Sly&apos;s family. Although they are still weary from the adventures in the previous game, they have to get up and face the new threat that could mean the end of Sly&apos;s business and the loss of his family heritage. The game itself is a lot like the previous games- Sly sneaks, jumps, and swings himself around the levels, collecting various items, defeating bad guys and ultimately taking on the boss character. The other members of the gang step in on the action once in a while but the Sly centric sections are the main focus of the game. If you like games that had many things to do, this sneak-em-up/platform/action/adventure/puzzle game is for you.</story>

    <story>Just as the title of the game suggests, you play a smuggler. A smuggler who is carrying either illegal weapons or contraband drugs or a few other kinds of material. Since you have these illegal things in your possession, you are a prime target. A target by law enforcement, a target by rival smugglers and gang, a target by more militaristic forces of the United States. If you can survive the high speed chases, the off-road evasion, the gunfire and the dust... you stand to make quite a profit. Maybe enough to outfit your vehicle for your next smuggling endeavor. Something that will make the next run a little less hazardous. Altogether there are over 30 missions inside of 3 distinct and vast environments. Vast in the full sense of the word, in that you can drive literally anywhere with the game&apos;s areas... and get lost doing it too.

    <story>Sniper Elite is a third-person action strategy game with a focus on sniping. The player takes on the role of an American agent working for the OSS (the organization that later became the CIA) stationed in Berlin at the end of World War II, tasked with preventing the Russian troops from getting hold of the research Germany had been conducting into nuclear weaponry. As an elite sniper, the style of play is much less run-and-gun and much more about finding good positions, lining up shots and taking out the enemy before he even knows where you are. The single-player campaign takes place over 28 missions set in and around Berlin. Players use stealth tactics, and things like wind and background noise can be a factor when lining up shots. When a shot is performed particularly well, players are rewarded with a &apos;bullet cam&apos; which follows the bullet in slow-motion from gun barrel to target. The game also includes a multi-player mode with a number of different game types.</story>

    <story>As Snoopy sleeps atop his doghouse, the player is transported into his dreams about the adventures of his alter ego, the World Famous WWI Flying Ace. The rest of the Peanuts characters are woven into his dream - and thereby the game&apos;s narrative - as they pass by the sleeping beagle. Lucy Van Pelt becomes the commander of the Allied forces, Linus and Sally take humorous turns as intelligence officers, while poor Charlie Brown is characteristically cast as a janitor in an Allied airbase. The story moves quickly after Charlie Brown is captured by the Red Baron&apos;s minions along with the plans for a secret weapon that could change the course of the war. Snoopy and his co-pilot Woodstock take to the skies in his trusty Sopwith Camel to recover the plans and rescue Snoopy’s hapless owner. The game mechanics center around third-person action adventure flight in contexts such as aerial races, dogfighting missions, and world exploration. Collectible items in the world unlock plane and weapon upgrades, as well as new character/plane combinations for use in versus multiplayer aerial combat. Hardcore Peanuts fans will recognize the front lines at Verdun, the woods of Montsec and Verdon Gorge as the settings for Snoopy’s original Flying Ace adventures in the comic strip by Charles M. Schulz. The game features 7 of these locations, which often change considerably from mission to mission. The flight model for Snoopy&apos;s Sopwith Camel and the other planes in the game leans heavily towards the fanciful arcade end of the realism spectrum. Controls and collision are forgiving and approachable for younger players, although advanced stunts such as barrel rolls and Immelmans are accessible through button combos for experienced aficionados of the air combat genre. The game includes boss sequences that offer novel variations on its core mechanics. For example, players will battle a flotilla of submarines as Woodstock, being towed behind Snoopy&apos;s plane in a toy balsa-wood glider. Here the mechanics are those of a rail shooter, with Snoopy pulling the player along a path while the player contends with a multi-stage boss fight. Pre-rendered cut scenes advance the narrative between missions as the player returns to a hub world represented by Charlie Brown&apos;s neighborhood. Here the player can upgrade his plane and weapons at Pig-Pen&apos;s Shop or complete a series of tutorials at Marcie&apos;s Flight School. The music and voiceovers in these sequences recall the classic Peanuts holiday specials that have been an annual fixture of American television since 1965.</story>

    <story>You might not have the ball skill, dazzling celebrity girlfriend or piles of cash in the bank, but you can still know what it feels like to be a world-class galáctico, without ever setting foot on the pitch. Soccer Life II is a management game with a difference. Set in the turbulent and exciting world of European football, it allows players to experience the ups and downs of life as both a successful team manager and a superstar footballer all at once. Select an unsigned protégé or choose a real life football legend from over 5000 FIFPro and JFA licensed superstars, then embark on a mission to train him and manage his career until he becomes the stuff of sports legend on the pitch. Gamers have total control over their players&apos; careers, from selecting training regimes and the area and position he&apos;ll play in, to the type of treatments to administer after injuries. You can even bark commands during matches, red-faced from the dugout. Other new additions include fully 3D character models, vastly improved player customisation tools and the possibility to select specific rival teams and their individual players. However, as readers of any celebrity gossip magazine will know, the actual football is only half of the story of any superstar player&apos;s life. Soccer Life II allows you to experience first-hand the celebrity lifestyle; the cars, the women and of course the endorsements, that turn players from mere sporting heroes into international mega-brand phenomena. You decide whether your hero dates a string of celebrity hotties, or settles down in that luxurious country manor house and raises a family. It&apos;s up to you whether he opens a themed restaurant chain, lends his face to a range of clothing or starts breeding race horses to help keep the cash flowing. Soccer Life II offers a winning mixture of serious management, strategy and player customisation, as well as its unique aspirational lifestyle simulation. It is sure to prove popular with football fans across the spectrum, from hardcore season ticket holders to Heat -reading female fans. </story>

    <story>Sonic Riders- Zero Gravity is a hoverboard-racing set in the Sonic universe and it is the sequel to Sonic Riders. When four mysterious meteorites crash into the planet, they accidentally activate MeteorTech robots around the globe who go on a rampage. It&apos;s up to Team Sonic to find out the mystery behind the MeteorTech and why the robots are going after the meteorites. Compared to the previous game, this edition presents some new abilities. By performing tricks and completing challenges, gravity points can be earned. This allows for the Gravity Dive that opens up a black hole, sucking the player in and thus providing faster speed, and Gravity Control. By changing gravity alternate paths can be used through walls and other surfaces. A third one is called Gravity Drift. Just like the Grip move in the previous game, characters can use it to turn tight on corners. There are various items, obstacles on the course and different vehicles such as hover boards, bikes, air riders, yachts, air skates and other crafts. These can all be upgraded, even while racing. The three new game modes are Survival Mode (smash into opponents on certain parts of a track), Survival Relay (relay courses with multiple players) and Survival Ball (football game). There are sixteen courses with two tracks each, sixty different vehicles, and eighteen playable characters, of which most need to be unlocked. They are divided into three categories (Speed, Fly and Power) and have personalized gear that allows them to make use of specific short-cuts.</story>

    <story>In Sonic Riders, Dr. Eggman challenges Sonic and his friends to a Worldwide Grand Prix, and the prize for coming out on top is an ultra-rare Chaos Emerald! Gliding on air boards – which are performance-oriented for each playable character – gamers will experience a heightened sense of sports-style racing tension as Sonic and his pals perform tricks and stunts over treacherous wide-open terrain. Sonic and friends speed through tracks on air boards, using individual special moves to strike down opponents. Air is a big element of Sonic Riders. Your board&apos;s fuel source is air. You can fill up your air at various points on the course, but to race well you&apos;ll have to use another means of replenishment- performing tricks with your board. You&apos;ll also want to make use of turbulence from racers who are in front of you.</story>

    <story>In Sonic Unleashed for the Wii and PS2, as in the 360/PS3 version, Eggman defeats Sonic, using the power of the Chaos Emeralds to trap him. The sheer force of that attack broke the planet into pieces, and released Dark Gaia from the depths. Eggman then leaves Sonic trapped on the broken planet, along with the now-useless Emeralds. It is now up to Sonic to re-power the Chaos Emeralds, fix the planet, re-capture Dark Gaia, and, of course, defeat Eggman. The game features both daytime levels, which focus on Sonic&apos;s speed, and nighttime levels, which are more combat-focused, and have Sonic turning into a were-hog, as a side-effect of the Chaos Emerald attack he suffered. The PS2 and Wii versions feature an almost completely new mix of levels, and a different engine.</story>

    <story>The Sopranos- Road to Respect is a third person action-adventure game based on the popular HBO series The Sopranos. In the game, the player portrays Joey LaRocca, a young enforcer working in the organization of Tony Soprano. Joey is the illegitimate son of Sal Big Pussy Bonpensiero, who was revealed to be an informant and was killed by Tony at the end of Season 2 of the television show. The storyline of the game involves Joey attempting to rise up in Tony&apos;s organization and come out from under the shadow of his father. The game is linear mission-based. Most missions are given at one of the signature Sopranos locations, such as the Bada Bing or Satriale&apos;s. Each of these locations is modeled to look identical to the location from the television show. The player is given low-level tasks such as money collection and body dumping at first, but the story quickly ramps up to draw the player into a mob war between Tony Soprano&apos;s New Jersey crew and the the crew of Angelo Buscetta in Philadelphia. Gameplay is primarily brawler-based, with melee combos available and numerous weapons of opportunity, such as baseball bats, lamps, barbells, and whatever can be found at hand. The player can also use the environment as a weapon, slamming the enemy&apos;s head into a filing cabinet or even pushing his face into a table saw. There is some firearm combat in the game, which uses a typical third-person targeting system. However the player is taught early on that opening fire in a public place will cause a loss of respect from his peers. If the respect bar drops to zero, the player is killed by his own crew. At various points in the game during conversations with an NPC, the player is prompted to have Joey act tough, play it smooth, or go somewhere in between. The decisions made here can determine whether the player ends up in a fight, or is able to talk his way out of the situation. The game also features a poker mini-game. The player can play Texas Hold &apos;Em against Tony, Christopher and Paulie. Once unlocked early in the campaign, the mini-game becomes available at the Bada Bing or directly from the main menu. Voice acting for The Sopranos characters is handled by the actors who perform the role on the television program, including James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano.</story>

    <story>Following the events in Legacy of Kain- Soul Reaver, Raziel discovers a way back through time and encounters one of the Circle of the Nine, Mobius the timestreamer. Mobius urges Raziel to continue his quest for revenge and destroy the vampiric Kain. Raziel reluctantly agrees and heads off to discover the knowledge and weapons that will allow him to achieve his goal. Soul Reaver 2 is a 3rd person adventure game, like the first game. The player controls the game from behind Raziel&apos;s shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, swimming, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel can grip onto the sides of ledges, climb walls and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. Raziel can shift through the material world into the spectral realm at will... but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel&apos;s life energy at a constant rate. Raziel must restore energy by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. Raziel no longer gains abilities from absorbing great souls and instead must imbue his Soul Reaver weapon by activating certain elemental temples. Once activated, various elemental fonts can be used to charge the Soul Reaver to specific attributes. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of other weapons including daggers, swords, axes, spears as well as the Soul Reaver and bare-handed claws. Unlike the previous game, Soul Reaver 2 is linear and follows specific paths through different areas. Raziel cannot return to certain areas once he has left them behind. Soul Reaver 2 features a variety of different puzzles, often involving blocks or manipulation of different devices. One common theme is light puzzles where Raziel must reflect light, using mirrored objects, so that they touch switches or objects which require activation.</story>

    <story>Mortal Kombat-style one-on-one fighting is one thing, but fighting with weapons is completely different. Soul Calibur II continues the tradition set by Soul Blade and the Dreamcast Soul Calibur with intense action and plenty of weapons to deal the massive blows. A majority of the action takes place in Weapon Master mode, as you choose a character and travel a set map to fight the many other warriors through a collection of different terrain styles and challenges. One minute you&apos;ll be fighting in quicksand; the next you&apos;ll have to defeat an opponent by only using throwing attacks. Other modes include the usual arcade, survival, and practice modes, and multiplayer options for two people to battle it out. Each version of Soul Calibur II also includes a unique character for the platform. Spawn appears on Xbox, Link from The Legend of Zelda series can be found on GameCube, and Tekken fighter Heihachi finds his way to PS2.</story>

But Soul Edge was an evil weapon, and when Siegfried claimed it, he was turned into a creature named Nightmare. As time passed, Nightmare rampaged across Europe leaving a path of destruction, despite the efforts of other fighters. One day, a mysterious man carrying a scythe confronts Nightmare and splits Siegfried from his cursed form. He then resurrects the Azure Armor to carry on as the Nightmare creature. At the same time, a young girl Tira pledges herself to Soul Edge&apos;s dark power, and a woman named Setsuka swears to avenge her master. All the while new rumors of the Soul Edge spread across the world, causing many who had searched for it before to once more venture out...

The first is Tales of Souls, which allows the player to select any one of 24 characters and travel through their individual story to search for the Soul Edge. Most of this mode is standard fighting, however there are choices to be made on the world map and actions to be performed during cutscenes. The second is Chronicles of the Sword, where a custom character is created and brought to serve in a war between three nations. Strategy must be used to direct units and defend important strongholds.

The single-player, story-mode follows the fortunes of three characters. Each individual has different attributes, weapons and story paths. Rendered cut scenes punctuate the action and help the story to develop. The survival mode can be played by either one or two players. The objective is to collect points by destroying the marauding Invaders and blasting objects while dodging the hail of laser-death that the aliens rain down on you. In the survival-mode the game will continue relentlessly until your character&apos;s hit point meter reaches zero. </story>

    <story>25 years after Space Invaders was released, Taito has decided to bring us a special anniversary edition that includes all the versions of Space Invaders that were ever released in the arcades, plus two extra game modes. These include- 1. Space Invaders - monochrome version- The original, as first appeared in 1978. Move your ship left or right, shooting at oncoming invaders, while dodging theirs. Shoot the flying saucer that goes across the screen for extra points. Four barriers protect you from invaders&apos; shots, but will be destroyed after several hits. Once you shoot every invader on screen, you have to do it again and again. The game ends when all lives are lost. 2. Space Invaders - color version- Same version as above, but in color. 3. Space Invaders - cellophane version- Five strips of cellophane (cyan, green, yellow, blue, red) are placed across the game screen, in an attempt to block out the two black areas. 4. Space Invaders - upright version- Space Invaders in color, but a background has been added, and contains a planet and some stars. 5. Space Invaders doubles- Two players can play at the same time. Lives are separate, so if one players loses all their lives, the other keeps on playing. 6. Space Invaders Part II- Known as Space Invaders Deluxe in the US. The differences between the original and this game is that there are two different flying saucers- one is steadily visible and another blinks. Different points are awarded for each one that is killed. Also, from wave two onwards, invaders can be split into two when shot, and the flying saucers drop alien reinforcements. Also available as a cocktail cabinet. 2. Space Invaders VS- Two-player game. The screen is split is split into two, with each side reserved for each player. Invaders occupy both sides. The object of the game is to kill these invaders, so that you can destroy the ship at the top of the screen that belongs to your opponent. Matches are determined before the start of the game. You can have a CPU opponent. 7. Space Invaders 3D- Everything on screen appears in 3D. Instead of bullets, not only do invaders shoot arrows at you, but they can launch fireballs at you. You lose a life when you come in contact with these. As always, flying saucers go across the screen, but will then fly directly toward you. When these saucers are hit, you automatically receive a power-up that will help you kill the invaders. Before you start each game, you can adjust the view of which you can play. One view shows the cabinet as it is played as if you are standing in front of the machine itself, while another allows you to play the game in full-screen mode. The sounds of Space Invaders serves as the background music, but this can be changed to music from various Taito games, such as Bubble Bobble, Elevator Action, The Fairyland Story, Darius, and several others. Other options let you choose the number of lives to start off with and adjust the number of points needed to gain extra lives. Along with the games, you can also view promotional material, as well as any development sheets for the original game.</story>

    <story>Spider-Man- Web of Shadows - Amazing Allies Edition is a 2D side-scroller with 3D graphics. The story is similar to the seventh-generation console versions. A break-off piece of Venom&apos;s symbiote begin infecting New Yorkers and it is up to Spider-Man to save the city. He can switch between the back and red suits at any time, which each have their own move set and abilities. As Spider-Man defeats enemies, he is given skill points which can be used to purchased boosted stats and new moves. These are separate for each costume. In general, red focuses on agility and black on brutality. In order to purchase moves you must have not only the necessary points, but sufficient reputation. Throughout the game, you have conversations with other characters where you are given red, black or neutral choices. Answering red or black will build that suit&apos;s reputation, as will various other actions throughout the game. You can take five power-ups into each level. These can be special abilities, such as temporary invincibility, or the titular allies. When summoned, they appear on screen and do their specific type of damage, then disappear. Allies are unlocked by beating bosses. The red suit unlocks hero allies like Luke Cage and Storm and the black suit unlocks villain allies like Galactus and Hobgoblin.</story>

However, the action becomes even more intense as not only does Spidey have to keep the streets safe in general for the citizens of Manhattan, he also has to face up against such super villains as Rhino, Shocker, Mysterio and Calypso, as well as a few entanglements with the Black Cat along the way to square off against Dr. Octopus and save New York in the process!</story>

    <story>Based off the 2007 movie of the same name, Spider-Man 3 puts players in charge of the titular hero as he tries to once again New York City safe from the combined menace of the New Goblin, the Sandman, and Venom. The game style is similar to Spider-Man 2 in which the player is free to explore a large scale version of New York City in a Sandbox style, this time in a larger city that allows for exploration of the subway and sewer systems. The game also allows for players to adventure in storylines not explored in the third film, such as facing familiar Spider-Man villains like Kraven, the Lizard, Scorpion, Rhino and the Kingpin, or breaking up various gang factions. One of the main focal points of the new game is the inclusion of Spider-Man&apos;s black symbiote costume. When wearing the traditional red and blue costume, Spider-Man is more fast and is more accepted by the public. When wearing the black costume, Spider-Man becomes stronger and more aggressive. The game also includes cineractives - cinematic scenes that allow for participation via button presses or controller movements. This version also has the inclusion of Morbius and Shriek as bosses to fight against. The black costume is an interchangeable accessory after a certain point in the game, but can threaten to overwhelm Peter if worn too long. The Wii version allows for full web-swinging control via the Wiimote and Nunchuk. The control set-up acts as Spider-Man&apos;s hands, allowing players to swing by performing the appropriate gestures.</story>

    <story>In Sprint Car Challenge, you drive light weight cars around short dirt tracks in three game modes- test drive, race and challenge. In test drive you can practice with each available car and track in the game, without any limits of how long you can play. In race mode you will race against seven other drivers. The challenge mode works like race mode, but the player in last place for each lap is eliminated and it ends when just one player remains. At the start of the game you will only have a sprint car, but as you perform well in races, you&apos;ll unlock two other cars, the sand rail and the 4x4 rallycat, as well as new tracks. Some actions during races, like crashing or skidding, will give extra points.</story>

There are a variety of events to compete in, from your usual all-on-all race through courses, scattered with obstacles and huge jumps to perform wacky tricks, plus there&apos;s a half pipe to bust tricks, and there&apos;s plenty of challenging tricks to master, and items to grind to gain bonuses. Plus, you can ride the entire mountain whenever you like, either to practice moves or learn all the bumps and corners for the big races. With challenges and races comes rewards, and along with trophies and medals to fill up your gallery you can also win cash prizes to purchase new items, improving your board or improving your image. The more you race the more experience your chosen character receives, leveling up your abilities and improving your technique, plus even more wild tricks to perform.</story>

    <story>SSX Tricky is EA&apos;s follow up to SSX. Tricky features far more storytelling than the original through the use of personality attributes. Rivalries develop between characters with opposing attributes, causing them to act more aggressively towards each other during races. The übertrick system adds a whole new layer to the game. These tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you a nice boost. Performing six übertricks in a row results in a super übertrick, which rewards you with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC&apos;s It&apos;s Tricky to play. Seven tracks return from the original accompanied by brand-new Garibaldi and Alaska tracks. The returning tracks contain up to four times as many shortcuts and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return (Jurgen and Hiro suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by six new ones. The soundtrack will feature mixes by Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite, and the Plump DJs. DVD-like bonuses include behind-the-scenes footage and a making of segment.</story>

    <story>For the first time in gaming history, after countless games depicting various aspects of the rich Star Wars universe (including some we never wanted to see), players have the chance to step into the boots of the average soldier in the wars that raged across the galaxy. Gameplay is based on the successful standards set by Battlefield 1942, but combat in Battlefront is even more massive and heated, vehicles are more predominant and the familiar starships are also included. There are three different game modes to play- Historical Campaign (featuring a series of historical battles from the Star Wars mythos), Conquest (in which players vie for dominance of individual planets) and, of course, Instant Action. The game puts two pairs of factions at war- Republic vs Separatists and Rebel Alliance vs Galactic Empire. Each faction has four standard unit types (soldier, heavy weapons trooper, scout and pilot) plus a fifth, special unit which differs radically for each side. Famous Jedi and Sith are included as NPCs only in selected battles. Finally, the game offers almost all of the vehicles seen in the movies for players to fly, drive or hover and prevail.</story>

    <story>Jango Fett is about to take on a project that could make or break his bounty hunting career, and his life. Chosen to be the blue-print for the Clone Army, Jango must now prove himself in order to gain the biggest job on the streets, wiping out the deadly cult, Bando Gora. Every other bounty hunter in the galaxy is willing and able to do the job, so you must work hard to gain the contract from Darth Tyranus. To win the contract, you must complete a range of missions and collect the bounties on worlds very familiar to Star Wars fans. Jango has his trusty dual pistols to help him out, but also has the ability to use his flame thrower, jet pack, poison darts and much more. Bounty Hunter also has the unique bounty hunting system, where each mission has a specific number of bounties hiding out in the level. Jango must identify them with his helmet gear, and catch them alive...or dead. Bounties allow the player to unlock bonus materials. The 3rd person action title also includes full motion cut-scenes designed by Industrial Light and Magic and Skywalker Sound, plus a few hidden extras and Easter eggs. Bounty Hunter also connects to the movies in that it explains how Jango became the model for the Clone Army of the Republic, and how he became acquainted with Zam Wesell, who makes an appearance in the movies.</story>

    <story>It&apos;s Star Wars like you have never seen it before. Each character, from Episode 1, looks more like something from a Japanese animation. While flying around the many familiar landscapes (Tatooine, the underwater village Otoh Gunga and a driod control ship in orbit over Naboo) your character can use the many weapons and power-ups that litter the tracks, as well as using moves that only they can perform. For example. Jar-Jar uses his tongue to grab onto anyone in front of him, so he can catch up, while Darth Maul throws his double edged lightsaber as a very deadly weapon. Also keep an eye out for monsters and items that get in the way on the track. Some may be useful, others very annoying.</story>

The Clone Wars has you deep inside the battles of the Old Republic through 16 missions, piloting a range of vehicles including speeder bikes, Republic Gunships and fighter tanks as well as the weapon of the Jedi, your lightsabre, for close combat.

The player takes control of a young boy who was discovered by Darth Vader while fighting the boys Jedi father on the planet of Kashyyk. Vader takes the boy as his own secret apprentice, training him to bring down the rest of the surviving Jedi&apos;s scattered across the galaxy. The majority of the game has the player exploring levels, using force powers such as lightning and grip to decimate opponents by throwing them off of high areas, electrocuting them or even using environmental objects to slam them into their opponents as well Force Repulse that can propel enemies backwards. There is also the classic light-saber, slicing opponents up with the ability to change its colors by finding different color crystals throughout the game. Players can upgrade these powers by destroying enemies, filling up on blue orbs that are left behind to earn points to earn more powerful attacks. More force orbs can be obtained by using flashy and complex on enemies. The player will also encounter bosses towards the end of the levels, ranging from Jedi&apos;s to large creatures like a Rancor. To kill these bosses, the player must complete a series of button pressing scenes, like in the God of War games. This version differs from it&apos;s next-gen brethren, only featuring the Havok engine and different level layouts, including a new level that involves the remains of the Jedi Temple as well as story differences (ex- In the first stage of the game the player takes control of Darth Vader, on the PS3 and 360 version, Vader lands in the middle of the day to encounter a Fleet Admiral and fight the Jedi at the end at his hut, while the PS2 version has Vader landing in the night, encounter a Clone Commander and fight the Jedi in an open field, surrounded by wreckage and fires from downed Tie-Fighters).</story>

    <story>Starsky &amp; Hutch is an arcade racing game based on the popular TV series from the 70s, released to tie in with the film. The game includes 18 missions, each based on an episode of the TV show and introduced by Antonio &apos;Huggy Bear&apos; Fargas. There is also a free roaming mode, in which the player explores the GTA-esque environment looking for action and trouble. Like the film, the game does not entirely play it straight. Starsky &amp; Hutch are actually shooting a TV show, and the scoring for each mission reflects how ratings-friendly your driving is. You are awarded gold, silver or bronze medals for each mission depending on performance, and must get at least 1 gold and 2 silvers on season 1 for a second season to be commissioned, and 3 golds and 2 silvers in season 2 for there to be a third for you to play through. The overall goal in each mission is usually to chase and destroy a criminal&apos;s car. There is always a secondary target as well. In addition, the player will gain viewers by hitting the bad guy, pulling off elaborate jumps and skids, nearly hitting civilians, and hitting the bonus targets such as canisters which are strewn through the levels. Hitting civilians will lose viewers. Dave Starsky is the guy behind the steering wheel and Ken &apos;Hutch&apos; Hutchinson shoots out of the windows of the car. On PS2 and XBox a second player can take care of the shooting, using either a light gun or a standard controller. During single player, the aiming is automatic for shooting.</story>

Players have only a limited amount of lives, however, extra lives can be obtained during the game. The main feature of Steel Dragon Evolution is that the main fire button is analogue. The more pressure is applied to the button, the heavier the fire power of the player&apos;s craft becomes. As a trade-off at the same time the craft&apos;s speed is reduced. Alternatively, three separate buttons for low, medium and heavy fire can be pressed. If a player destroys an enemy, a multiplier is applied from 1x to 256x depending on how heavy the fire power applied was. However, some enemies drop stars which also have a multiplier of 1x to 256x attached to them. Here the scale is reversed, not firing at all while collecting the stars gives the highest multiplier.</story>

    <story>The world is dying. The country of Solum are surrounded by poisonous fog. This fog devours everything on its way, and is slowly moving towards the few remaining towns and villages, about to consume the rest of humanity. The main religion of this world, Aeque, preaches that this is the will of God, and that the human beings should not resist and allow themselves to extinct. But an underground rebel movement is trying to dispel the fog with a magical structure called Gate of Eternity. Spero, the young protagonist of the game, must find his place amidst the conflict between the Empire he serves and the rebels. Stella Deus is a strategy console-style RPG. You command your units by moving them around the isometric battle view. Each action - whether movement, physical attack, or magic spell - requires action points (AP). After the battles, your characters gain levels and get new abilities. Outside of battle, you can tackle the huge optional dungeon, Catacomb of Trials, and access towns via the menu. In towns you can fuse items to obtain more powerful ones, and receive side quests which mostly involve going to a certain place on the map and participating in a battle there.</story>

You and your partner in crime, Louie Palmer, have recently landed a job to steal a statue that&apos;s been placed in a museum for an exhibition. Once you&apos;re in the museum things turn out not to be quite so easy and not quite the way the should be. The gameplay resembles Thief- The Dark Project but also feels a lot like Splinter Cell and Metal Gear Solid to an extent. Several elements can be recognized from those games, but many of these have been changed slightly or just implemented in an original way. The core of the game is about stealing, without killing.</story>

But when a greedy baker plans to take over their hometown and steal all their hard-earned crops, she and her friends then journeyed to the Land of Dreams in order to turn back the tide. Just like most platforming games, you jump, collect coins, er, seeds, and explore your way throughout various levels. There are also some minigames, which, though uninspired for a hardcore gamer, would probably keep a child occupied. In later levels players will be given access to various dream powers, which is functionally similar to Plasmids in BioShock, allowing the player to spawn platforms or zap enemies, at the cost of some points, which can be recharged, somewhat like EVE. The game also includes some interesting extras such as recipes for various desserts, as well as extra playable characters and a virtual farm mode which allows players to grow various plants.</story>

Stuntman also includes a stunt park editor, where you can place ramps, obstacles, and other equipment in an arena, and then choose to play it. As a Stuntman, you get to drive a variety of cars, such as police cars, sports cars, trucks, and armored vehicles. Stuntman can be informative, as well. Before each stunt, your character will describe what he has to do, and how important timing is. You can learn various techniques that real stunt drivers use, such as the cannon roll and the nitro boost. You can also learn what the different pieces of equipment are called, such as the side pipe, which is used to roll a car onto it&apos;s side.</story>

    <story>Stuntman- Ignition is a game based on the original 2002 Stuntman game. Players assume the role of a Hollywood stunt driver working for a movie studio. Each level is based upon a movie and players will have to drive through the level, earning points by performing stunts. After the end of each level, players can review their performance by watching the movie that was created. There are six movies to choose from, each with different settings, goals and challenges- Aftershock, Whoopin and a Hollerin&apos; II, Strike Force Omega, Overdrive, Never Kill Me Again and Night Avenger. Each movie consists of 6 scenes where the goals set by the director must be followed. To progress, a successful series of stunts is required, but the amount of points can be increased by linking them together and adding extra danger by drifting, getting airborne, or getting close to other cars and obstacles. The multiplayer portion offers 2 game modes. In Backlot Battle players have to perform as many stunts as possible in a set amount of laps. Backlot Race offers straightforward racing where boost is earned through stunts. The PS2 version only offers offline gameplay, while the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions have multiplayer supported through the DemonWare middleware.</story>

    <story>The Suffering- Ties That Bind follows in the footsteps of its predecessor by combining a disturbing horror atmosphere with action/shooter gameplay. Players can switch between third person and first person depending on their preference, and will shoot a lot of hideous demonic manifestations of evil before the game is done. The player is also able to transform into a hideous creature at key times in the game, which allows him to engage in intense melee combat. The game includes a morality system which records the player&apos;s actions during gameplay and changes the story accordingly, and also alters the player&apos;s creature form. Everything from the first The Suffering has been refined and turned up a notch for the sequel. The story picks up right where the first game left off. The player once again takes on the role of Torque, former death row inmate with a mysterious past. Now returning to his home town of Baltimore, Torque must confront the mysterious Blackmore, the man who may or may not have killed Torque&apos;s family. But it won&apos;t be easy, as the hideous creatures from the first game have now overrun the streets of Baltimore. Will Torque finally be able to come to grips with his past?</story>

Shortly after being interred in a new prison on Carnate Island, an earthquake appears to release demonic creatures based on the many modes of execution used in the sordid history of the island. These creatures proceed to eliminate much of the prison population, leaving only you and a scant few other inmates and guards to eliminate the horde and find out what has happened.</story>

    <story>A simple young boy from a small village, a noble knight and heroine of the nation, a mysterious mercenary. Hugo, Chris, and Geddoe - three people, three fates, three points of view. The Trinity Sight System allows you to play the first half of the game from three different perspectives, seeing events from various angles. There is a conflict between the independent nation of Zexen, and the Grassland with its seven villages. Both sides accuse each other of treason and cruelty, and the war seems inevitable - especially when the mighty empire of Harmonia appears on the horizon, with its own interests in the matter. Who is right and who is wrong? Only by playing through the stories of all the three main characters is it possible to understand what is going on. Suikoden III is the third game in Konami&apos;s RPG series, which is based on the classic Chinese novel Shui Hu - a story about rebellion, friendship, and treason. You control three main parties (up to six people each), and also many other characters, some of them entirely optional. There are three kinds of battles in Suikoden III- party-based, duel (one on one), and strategic combat, where you move around and control several parties. Party-based combat occupies the larger portion of the game. You can buy and affix magic to your characters, and improve their various skills at your own wish by visiting training and educational centers. Like in both previous games, you can recruit up to 108 characters (Stars of Destiny) and manage your own castle.</story>

    <story>This is the fourth installment of Konami&apos;s famous role-playing series, which are loosely based on the classic Chinese novel Water Margins by Shi Nai&apos;an. The events of the game take place 150 years before those of Suikoden III, and the region of the Suikoden universe they occur in are the islands south of Toran. The hero of the game is a young orphan who was brought up as a servant in a nobleman&apos;s house on one of those islands. One day, he finds a magic rune, and realizes it is the Rune of Punishment - one of the 27 legendary True Runes that grant the bearer enormous power. Yet while devastating the enemies, this rune is also bound to deplete the hero&apos;s life.... Suikoden IV retains many classic features of the series- the ability to recruit 108 characters (Stars of Destiny) and to build and develop your own castle, emphasis on political issues in the story, the ability to equip runes of various kinds in combat that allow the usage of magic spells, etc. You can now have only four active members in your party (six in previous games). Once again, there are three types of combat in the game- the most common, party-vs.-party combat, the duels, and strategic ship battles, which replaced the army battles from the previous games.</story>

    <story>Suikoden Tactics is a Suikoden game spin-off. It is a tactical strategy game with RPG elements. The story is about what happened after the Kooluk and Island Nations war and the mystery about the origins of the Rune Cannons. Kyril, the main character, is a powerful young warrior who is continuing his father&apos;s fanatical obsession with learning all he can about the Rune Cannons. The gameplay is similar to Fire Emblem. The game offers a combo attack plan by allowing players to build stronger relationships with each fight. If two characters converse during battle, they will improve fighting compatibility with each other. Overall, the gameplay is similar to most Strategy RPGs. Different upgradeable skills and spells make up the bulk of the gameplay. The story is rendered in real-time and has voiceovers.</story>

    <story>The Queendom of Falena is a matriarchy ruled by Queen Arshtat. The Sun Rune, one of the legendary 27 True Runes, is said to protect Falena from all dangers and works in conjunction with the Twilight Rune and the Dawn Rune. Recently, the inhabitants of the town of Lordlake had rebelled against the queen&apos;s rule. In order to put an end to the rebellion, the queen used the power of the Sun Rune. The immense power of the rune had a strange influence on the queen. The citizens are terrified. You, the prince of Falena, who cannot inherit the throne because of the matriarchy laws, decide to get to the bottom of the things by traveling to Lordlake. Thus begins an adventure that will involve unlocking the power of the True Runes... Suikoden V is the fifth installment of the series which are loosely based on the classic Chinese novel Shuihuzhuan (Water Margin). The traditional elements of the series - such as the ability to recruit 108 characters to help you on your quest, maintaining of an own castle, the rune-based magic system (limited casting of spells instead of magic points) - are all present in this installment. The strategic army battles similar to those of the second and third game are also back. As in the first two games, you have an active party of six characters, and four as back-up. Party formation plays a major role now, as you&apos;ll get bonuses from usage of different tactics. The characters can also learn various skills and execute combo attacks which vary depending on the members you currently have in your active party.</story>

    <story>The Sum of all Fears is a first person shooter game reminiscent of the Rogue Spear series. It&apos;s from the same development team and the look and feel is alike, although it&apos;s not as tactical as Rogue Spear. The game&apos;s story is build around the Tom Clancy book with the same title. You take control of a team of elite fighters trained for hostage rescue and anti-terror operations. Each and every team member is the best of the best. The first mission is to recapture a TV station seized by terrorists who broadcast their demands into the world. They have hostages, too, so you need to ensure that no-one gets hurt. But that&apos;s only the beginning of a global campaign against terrorism taking in 11 missions. A training mode and multiple difficulty levels are included. Unlike Rogue Spear, you can&apos;t choose team members or equipment, it&apos;s all pre-defined, from a range of over 15 guns plus grenades . You can&apos;t make your own mission plans either, so it comes down to controlling a team member, shooting every terrorist you see and performing various tasks (disarming security systems etc.). Unlike other shooter games, you can&apos;t survive many bullets, two wounds is usually enough to kill you. However, you then can switch to another team member.</story>

It features 26 sports divided into seven disciplines- Swimming, jumping, throwing, cycling, running, platform diving and archery. The handling is similar for all of them- rhythmic motions to keep the athlete moving and quick time events (pressing a button when it gets displayed on the screen) for performing certain actions. The mentioned rhythmic motions depend on the input device the player uses, e.g. at the swimming event the player needs to press two buttons alternately when using a keyboard and rotate the analog sticks when using a gamepad. The game features a basic career mode where the player gains a fixed amount of experience points after every event which an be reinvested into improved stats. There is also a optional arcade mode where the players have so-called boosts to their disposal to improve their athlete&apos;s performance for a short time.</story>

    <story>In the previous game, Summoner, Joseph became the god Urath, reborn by uniting the eight rings of summoning. Joseph’s culture hated the goddess Laharah and called her the “goddess of death.” This sequel takes place twenty years later in the realms of Halassar, Galdyr and Munari City which are across the world. You play Maia, who is the incarnate of the goddess Laharah and the powerful Queen of the realm of Halassar. Unlike Joseph’s kinship, Maia’s people worship Laharah as a benevolent creator. Maia was born with the mark of prophecy, her fate being written in the Book of Prophecy. From the beginning, she has welcomed her destiny and knows that she must fulfill the prophecy. What is unknown to her is the path she must follow to do so. Instead of summoning creatures to fight side-by-side with Maia, she actually becomes the demon when it is summoned. Three characters can be part of Maia’s party at one time and AI scripts can be assigned to each. Different characters are introduced as the story progresses and Maia’s skills improve. You can also choose to adventure in “solo-mode”, leaving your party members behind to go on alone. If you played the first game, you will notice immediately that Summoner 2 has a different combat system. Each button press results in the swing of your weapon so that you have more control over the action during battles. Unlike the first game, Summoner 2 was not released for Windows.</story>

    <story>Our four heroes from Super Monkey Ball - Aiai, Meemee, Baby and Gongon - were enjoying a typical day, when they saw a flying machine crash down on a nearby island. Soon, they discovered that the mysterious Naysayers have appeared, spreading discord and unhappiness all over the island. And to top it all off, the prince and princess of the neighboring islands have gone missing on Jungle Island - if they aren&apos;t found and returned, there&apos;s sure to be trouble! Can our heroes restore order to Monearth? Super Monkey Ball Adventure takes the monkey rolling madness of the previous games and puts a story-based spin on it. Choosing from one of the four monkeys, Players roll their way around the various islands of Monearth, talking to citizens and performing the tasks they request (such as delivering sandwiches, finding a missing baby, rescuing rare flowers, and more) to cheer them up. Certain parts of the island are locked by &apos;Puzzle Gates&apos; - these can only be unlocked by solving the puzzle stages which can be accessed in front of the gate. Each pad transports you to a different Puzzle Realm. The Puzzle Realm stages are the more familiar gameplay of Super Monkey Ball - simple looking stages where players must carefully (but quickly) roll their monkey to the finish line within the time limit. Bananas can also be collected throughout the game - these are used as currency, and can be used to unlock new playable characters and puzzle stages. They can also be given to particular unhappy citizens. The monkeys will also learn magical chants as they progress through the game - these allow you to climb walls, set your monkey&apos;s ball on fire, use a boxing glove to attack, and more. Also included in Super Monkey Ball Adventure are the famous Party Games - favorites like Monkey Race, Monkey Target and Monkey fight return. There&apos;s also three new games- &apos;Monkey Cannon&apos; - fire monkeys at enemy towers to steal their bricks for your own tower. &apos;Monkey Bounce&apos; - bounce on a trampoline-like platform with your opponents, and try to claim as many squares as possible. &apos;Monkey Tag&apos; - roll around a globe and try to collect as many balloons as possible.</story>

    <story>In Super Trucks Racing, you have the ability to race five-ton, 1,400 hp trucks with official professional teams, trucks, drivers and tracks. Drive carefully because any damage done to your truck will be visible and will affect the truck&apos;s ability to perform. The race marshals are also watching for any aggressive maneuvers against other drivers and they will penalize or disqualify you for doing so. Before each race, there will be a number of options to enhance your driving performance. Use the provided race or drift truck setups or create your own by adjusting your truck&apos;s tire pressure levels, suspension, steering locks and traction control. You are also able to practice on a track before you play to become familiar with your truck and the circuit. You can also qualify to try and get a front spot on the starting line. Six game modes are available to play. In Single Race Mode, quickly race against computer opponents with any unlocked vehicle and track. Championship Mode allows the competition of five championship races, each progressing in difficulty. Try to unlock all the extra trucks and circuits in this game mode. In Arcade Mode, you are to race against the clock and try to make each checkpoint to continue in the race. Time Trial Mode provides freedom to roam a track by yourself to try and make a record lap time. VS Mode is a split-screen competition involving two human players. Lastly, in Survival Mode, you will start out in last place and try to work your way to first place. After each lap, the truck in last place is disqualified. After it is all said and done, head over to the replay theater to playback your saved replays. Or take a gander in the trophy room to see all the trophies you have received. Then take a view at your records where you can view all of your great racing achievements.</story>

    <story>Superman Returns is based on the movie of the same name. You control the man himself as he flies around Metropolis, saves citizens and fights natural disasters, fires and supervillains alike. You have constant access to Superman&apos;s powers including heat vision, freeze breath, invulnerability and flight at supersonic speeds, though the former two are limited by a stamina bar. Unusually for this genre, Superman himself does not take damage and the challenges are all built around saving others from harm. Combat is accomplished through melee (you learn new combos as you progress in the game) as well as direct application of Superman&apos;s heat vision and freeze breath. Additionally, you may pick up objects, from the Daily Planet globe to tanker trucks, to throw at villains. You can also rip down a lamppost and use it as a club. Metropolis is presented as a wide open world where you can fly anywhere and perform any of the side missions at any given time. Besides the main story missions, there are 200 kittens to rescue and many fires to put out. The basic game is broken up a bit with two rather different sequences. There is a race around the city against Myxyzptlk and a Bizarro mode, in which you must destroy the city.</story>

    <story>Originally released as OZ (Over Zenith) in Japan, The Sword of Etheria is a single-player, 3rd person, role playing game with anime type graphics in a fantasy setting. Although some character names have been borrowed from The Wizard of Oz, the similarity ends there. The hero and main character is Fiel (Feel in the Japanese version), a boy who lost his parents at a young age and was raised by his sister Dorothy. Although they are human, Fiel and Dorothy can tap into their world&apos;s magical power, Etheria. Toto, their special cat, is able to transform itself into a sword. The brother and sister share their ability with the Katina, spiritual creatures captured and employed by evil gods to tyrannize mankind. Feel frees two Katina (Almira and Leon) and they join with him on his quest to vanquish the evil gods, rescue their world and reclaim the life-giving power of Etheria. The story unfolds during 20 chapters called stages. Gameplay includes exploration of the world in a free-roaming style, conversations with NPCs and party members. Objects and animals in the environment can be destroyed to find valuable items. Combat relies heavily on teamwork and how well the player works with the AI-controlled companions. Attack combinations during battle involve passing an enemy back and forth between party members. The more adept the player becomes in handling the chained combat moves, the more bonuses and rankings can be gained. Each character can be equipped with various armor, weaponry, and enchanted items like rings and necklaces. Items are found or can be purchased within the game. Dialog choices during gameplay effect the affection value of Almira and Leon. A partner with a higher ranking in this area will chain up your combo/pass more frequently. There are at least three different endings which are determined by which mode you are playing as well as your dialog choices. The game features Easy, Normal and Hard difficulty modes. The main difference between these modes is the amount and types of enemies that appear, items found in chests and dropped by enemies, and the respawn rate in some boss battles. In Story Mode, only Feel can be controlled until later stages when another one of the trio can be selected. Unlockables are only available after completing the game in this mode and include bonus stages, special items, costumes, characters and a gallery with music, sounds and images.</story>

As at the beginning of the game your sword play starts with what seems like swinging a bat rather than a sword technique, you improve your skill and techniques by stealing techniques by dueling with other swordsmen of which you add to your own library of sword techniques and customize which techniques suit your purposes. The semi-RPG elements refer to the skill and techniques development of your character. The more duels, missions and bouts your character accomplishes, the more sword techniques your character will eventually learn as well as gradually increasing your character stats. Thus dueling is the essence of the gameplay, may it be a friendly match with wooden swords or unofficial death matches using your steel sword (katana). Swordplay techniques are extremely complicated at first, comprising of detailed forms- Stances, each with different types of attacks; Parrying and the ability to counter attack after a correct block; Stance Attack, the ability for a surprise attack against a correct stance and much more. Learn all these techniques by dueling, learning from the local dojo&apos;s and ultimately gaining enough fame and skill to duel the many wandering master swordsmen that may teach you a thing or two about special sword skills.</story>

Over the centuries, the factory has been developing clockwork devices, specializing in perpetual mechanical movement. The factory&apos;s ambitions, however, are ill-suited to the contemporary economic climate, and the elderly Anna Voralberg, at the helm of the Valadilene factory for more than half a century, has decided to sell up. It turns out that the takeover might not be as straightforward as expected. The day that Kate Walker arrives, Anna Voralberg is being buried. What is more is that she has left an heir – her brother Hans. But Hans had left the valley at the end of the thirties and never returned, and was actually believed to be dead. However, a letter written by Anna in the days leading up to her death reveals that Hans is well and truly alive and living somewhere in… Siberia! Valadilene&apos;s elderly notary entrusted to take care of Anna&apos;s affairs suggests that Kate find Hans Voralberg as he is now the only person in a position to ratify the sale of the family business.

    <story>Logan&apos;s Shadow, the second PSP iteration of the long running Syphon Filter series, sees Gabe Logan in the battle of his life as he faces the possibility of his long time friend and ally, Lian Xing, could be a double agent. This 3rd-person stealth title uses all the tricks in the book, with Logan&apos;s task made simpler thanks to a number of gadgets, weapons and techniques available to him. For example, using boxes and walls to duck and cover or humans themselves to create a shield against incoming bullets can save you both health and time in the middle of the action. New interactive moments, such as unlocking doors or moving heavy items out of the way, require the right timing of button presses to pull off the moves. You will also go underwater to explore the depths of the ocean in order to take down the enemy and solve the mystery that could tear the world apart. There are five multiplayer modes available, two new to the franchise (Sabotage and Retrieval), and three returning modes (Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Rogue Agent).</story>

    <story>Taiko Drum Master is an entry in Namco&apos;s Taiko No Tatsujin rhythm game series and the first to have a Western release. As in other rhythm games, the goal is to interact with a special controller according to scrolling onscreen prompts timed to music. This game comes bundled with the TaTaCon drum controller, a miniature version of a Japanese taiko drum with sensors in the middle and on the sides. In-game actions are indicated by scrolling circle icons. Red circles indicate hitting the center of the drum, while blue circles require the player to hit the edge. On big circles, the player can hit both center or edge sensors for bonus points. Finally, yellow lines and balloons require the player to perform drum rolls. The game comes with a varied set of tunes- from covered pop hits like Material Girl and ABC to music from other Namco games such as Katamari Damacy and Dragon Spirit and even television theme songs. In addition, there are also several mini-games included on the disc that use the TaTaCon for more esoteric purposes, such as watermelon eating and wolf-stacking. The Japanese release is mostly the same, including keeping the game completely in English, but switches out a few of the tracks (particularly the TV show themes) for songs recognizable to Japanese audiences, such as We Will Rock You, I&apos;m A Slave 4 U, and I Was Born To Love You.</story>

    <story>The Great Juju Challenge is the third game in the platforming series. It stars Tak (the hero from the first two games) and his brother Lok. The story is about how the people in Tak&apos;s village have set up a course of events for people to compete in. The game is a mixture of platforming and adventure. Tak and Lok have entered the event in hopes of winning. Introduced to this game is the ability to swap between characters with the touch of a butto or in 2 player mode you can play together in split screen. The characters have to reach various checkpoints to extend the level. All the levels take place in the various jungle settings of Tak&apos;s Village. The events consist of swimming, racing, climbing ropes, and other endurance challenges. Tak is the magic user while Lok is the brawn. During the game, the two characters provide comical banter with each other. Tak can use a chicken suit to fly and a lobster suit to swim underwater. The cutscenes are in real time. Taloc, the bad guy from the previous games, is nowhere to be found as the game now focuses on the Juju challenge and not on trying to defeat the bad guy. Patrick Warburton voices Lok.</story>

    <story>Tak, hero from the previous game has been randomly falling into deep sleeps. During this time, he travels to a Dream World, where he is told that he must rescue a princess, or else he will fall into a sleep from which he will never awaken from. Tak and Jibolba, Tak&apos;s mentor, travel to visit Jibolba&apos;s brother, JB, who is an expert in dreams. Tak 2 is fairly different from Tak and the Power of Juju. While it is still a 3D platform game, it is more focused on puzzles and combat as opposed to collecting items. In earlier stages, Tak must use animals to his advantage as he makes his way through levels - for example, a bear can be used as a trampoline, Tak can ride warthogs after being sprayed by skunks to mask his scent, and more. Jibolba is along for the ride, but has transformed into a flea for easy transport. As a result, you can throw him at enemies to bite them and make them sleepy. Later on, Tak gains the power to transform into various animals himself. As a frog he can swim without being eaten by crocodiles, he can soar on air currents as a flying squirrel, and can break through barriers by charging through as a warthog. When Tak gains the titular Staff of Dreams as he progresses through the game, he can also create more powerful attacks using his magic, or juju.</story>

    <story>Tales of the Abyss is the story of Luke fon Fabre&apos;s unintentional journey outside of his mansion, which he has been locked inside of for the last several years, since he was found in an abandoned castle after an kidnapping attempt, with no recollection of his past. Luke soon uncovers a plot to destroy the world as he knows it, and he and his ever expanding party of comrades (including a fire spewing mouse-thing named Mieu) must help to unite two kingdoms, and settle on the matter of his own identity before the world comes to an end. ToA uses the same basic combat engine as its predecessors. The battles takes place on a pseudo-2D fighting ground that resembles the surrounding wilderness. You can set your party members to an AI controlled setting or give commands to each one by cycling through them in battle. This style can be somewhat of a hassle for those RPG fans who are used to the Final Fantasy style of combat, and it takes some getting used to even for Tales series veterans. The way the rest of the game plays is similar to that of traditional RPGS- you and your party go through many different towns, explore lots of dungeons, and explore. The exploration is done via the World Map screen, which is an isometric view that follows your character around as you move.</story>

    <story>This is a game where you have to use your sense of rhythm to pass the levels with 85 different songs. You walk around on a little stage with your character. As the music plays, markers pop up on the stage that expand in sync with the music. You have to hit those markers at the right time. This will trigger an instrument or jingle of the music (and give you points). Each characters has special abilities - some of them for example can move the markers to get them closer (or out of reach of the opponents). All characters can use a pitch-bend to change the tone of a triggered jingle for extra fun. Apart from having several game modes, you can also play this game solo or with a friend, either cooperative or in a battle mode to see who&apos;s got a better sense of rhythm.</story>

    <story>Teen Titans is based on the cartoon of the same name. Players control the five team members- Robin, Cyborg, Raven, Starfire and Beast Boy and can switch between them at any time. Each character has a unique set of powers and moves. In addition to the standard combos, in co-op modem characters can perform team moves together for added damage. There are power-ups to be found through the game which speed the world slow it down, increase your attack, etc. The game is set up as a series of levels and after completing a level, each heroes&apos; abilities are upgraded. The Titans receive a video game in the mail, but find themselves trapped inside when they try to play it. They must battle their way through many enemies, including bosses drawn from the show, to escape. There is also a multiplayer mode which works something like a four-player fighting game. This can be played against bots or with other humans. In addition to the Titans themselves, you can play as the bosses from single-player or more than a dozen other characters from the show that are unlocked by finding hidden items in story mode.</story>

    <story>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles- Mutant Melee is a 3D fighting game based on the 2003 animated series. The combat system is similar to the earlier games based on that series, but unlike them, it is a competitive vs. fighting game. It is not a traditional one-on-one fighter, but an arena-based, four-player game - somewhat along the lines of Power Stone. There are two game modes. There is a single-player adventure mode in which you must guide one of ten characters (including six unlockables) through a series of 100 bouts that have you either beating up enemies, or, in a few cases, dodging bombs for a set amount of time. Completion of these portions unlocks the additional characters, bonus characters and stages for melee mode. Melee mode is the multiplayer portion. It has ten basic and twelve unlockable characters, and nine basic and fifteen unlockable stages. There are four game types which mirror popular types from first-person shooters. There is a deathmatchesque knock-out mode, where the goal is to score the most KOs. (Players respawn after being KOed.) There is also a Last Man Standing mode, where the goal is to be the only player left when the others are KOed, a King of the Hill, where you must stand on a glowing patch of ground and defend it from other players, and a Keep away mode, where you must hold a treasure chest and avoid other players who are trying to beat you up and take it.</story>

Created by Game Arts, co-developer of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Smash-Up has many similarities with that title, with similar game modes, gameplay and controls. The game takes inspiration from various versions of the Turtles throughout the years- the character models are based closely on those from the 2007 animated film, while the character voices are provided by the cast from the 2003 series.

Each characters has their own ending sequence. •Practice- practice against a single enemy who can be set to pursue various strategies or be idle. •Mission- a series of 51 consecutive missions, each with a set goal. These include only using or finishing with certain moves or protecting a certain character from harm Modes playable with multiple players (with customizable rules, playable off- or online) include- •Battle Royal- free-for-all match. •Tournament- for up to eight players. •Swap Out- the winner of a match stays on for the next fight. Finally, Survival mode tasks players with fights against an endless number of enemies. Fighting moves include weak and strong attacks, special ninja powers, grabs and throws, guards, jumps and double jumps. Matches are won by depleting the enemy&apos;s health or throwing them out of the arena. Power-ups appear randomly during a fight, including one-time use weapons or pizza for health replenishment. Besides the seven starting characters, the game includes a further five that can be unlocked by beating the arcade mode. Exclusive to the Wii version are a further four characters, including several variations of Rabbid from Ubisoft&apos;s Raving Rabbids series.

Living in the sewers, they creep out when nobody is looking to fight for truth, justice and another slice of pizza.

The game is a 3D beat-em-up with multiple players. The game sprites all resemble the cartoony look of the TV show and each turtle features unique moves, sound bytes and fighting style all his own. Ninja Turtle moves include a weaker/quicker attack, a stronger/slower attack, Ninja Shuriken and a Jump-Kick.</story>

    <story>Telly Addicts is a game for one or two people based on the UK TV series of the same name that was aired in the mid to late 1980&apos;s. The game follows the format of the television series in that there are six rounds of multiple choice questions all of which are based on old television programs, each correctly answered question scores a point and in the multiplayer game the player with the most points wins. The rounds in the game are-•Screen Test - Here the player is presented with six TV screens from which they must select three. After each selection a picture is revealed and an associated TV trivia question is asked. •Classic Clips - This shows a short video excerpt from a television program after which three related questions are asked. •Spotlight Round - here we have five questions which must all be answered within ten seconds •Reveal Round - This starts with a grainy picture that gradually becomes clearer, the clearer the tincture, however, the fewer points are scored. •Guess The Year - The player is shown a picture and is asked a question such as When did this first appear on TV?, as an aid they are given the decade and just need to select the appropriate year. This is then followed by a couple of related trivia questions. •Randomiser - A spinner selects a category and the player must answer a related question. The game features the original presenter, Noel Edmonds who introduces each round and each question and, of course, clips and pictures from many UK and US TV shows.</story>

The player can race in a single, arcade race, take a complete free ride, or race in career mode. There are three kinds of racing to master- Circuit, Blitz, and Scramble. Circuit Races are exactly as they sound. The player howls around a course through checkpoints before time runs out at least twice. Blitz Races are considerably shorter than Circuit Races. The strategy for racing itself is not much different, except the race is in a linear fashion of point A-to-B. In Scramble Races the player roars around an area collecting checkpoints in a random location as fast as possible. These are the shortest races in the game. This game can be played by two players.</story>

    <story>Test Drive Unlimited lets the player choose one of several characters, both male and female, waiting at an airport to check in for their flight to the Caribbean dream island O&apos;ahu located in Hawaii. The characters do not have different statistics, that only applies to the extravagant, licensed cars. The whole island is accessible from the beginning and after the player has bought his first home and car, he can either drive around and look for events or load up the map and jump directly to a location of a race, a car salesman or other locations - similar to Need for Speed Underground. Every bought car has a built-in navigation system, guided by a woman&apos;s voice to get the player to his destination, either pre-programmed in the game or decided by the player. There are over 125 different cars and motorcycles in different price ranges to choose from. From the Audi TT over the Jaguar XJ200 to the McLaren F1 and Kawasaki Z1000, there is everything the character needs as a young man or girl with too much money on their hands. Each car has its own, realistic set of characteristics such as speed or handling, but they all have a highly detailed exterior and interior in common. The character starts with $200.000 dollars in his pocket, but there will not be anything left after buying a first car and home. Additional cash needs to be earned in different kinds of races from checkpoint challenges to time trials. The money cannot only be used to buy new homes and new cars (and a little tuning for those), but also to buy new outfits for the avatar. The heart of Test Drive Unlimited is the online mode. Using a GameSpy account, players connect to the official TDU server immediately after loading the game. New options become available online, such as a meeting lounge where the statistics and looks of other players can be looked up. It also provides access to player-created matches shown on the map screen. Creating a race here also works in the singleplayer modes. At any location, the start and finish can be defined, as well as the type of the race, which type/classes of cars or bikes are allowed and how many people can participate. If not all slots have been filled up by other players, the AI will take control of the rest. The PSP and PS2 versions have a lower visual quality and lack a few features, such as manual transmission, avatar customization, certain cars and all motorcycles, dealership and tuning shop NPCs, the vehicle interior camera angle and certain missions. They do include Master Points and Auto GPS, and certain default vehicles only available for the 360 version through download packs.</story>

    <story>It&apos;s Tetris as we all remember it. Drop different shaped blocks into the container, and fit them together to form a horizontal line, and the line disappears. Your job is to keep going as long as possible by clearing the container of blocks. This will be the first time on a Game Boy System that 4 players can play multiplayer Tetris, which is much the same as the original Tetris, only that when you clear a line of blocks, the line(s) appear in another players screen.</story>

    <story>It is 1960 and the peace and prosperity of Planet Earth is shattered as an aggressive alien species starts a full scale invasion. Their objective â€ the annihilation of the human race! The signs were there â€ a series of UFO sighting had led to speculation that we were not alone in the universe. But no-one expected the enormity of the threat. Mother ships, troop drop ships and super fast UFOâ€™s seem to be everywhere â€ and we were not prepared. The first â€ and last â€ line of defense is you and your squadron of 1960â€™s classic aircraft. You have the skills and the weaponry to battle with the UFOâ€™s â€ but the odds are against you as the enemy seems to have a never ending supply of UFOâ€™s. If you can force their ships to land and take control of a UFO you can fly undetected into the hornets nest of the Mother ship itself and turn the tide of war in your favour. Itâ€™s a simple case of destroy all aliens or be destroyed along with everyone else on the planet! </story>

    <story>Thrillville is an amusement park simulator where you take on the role of the favoured nephew or niece of the eccentric uncle Mortimer, the world-renowned owner of the Thrillville theme park franchise. When uncle Mortimer is indisposed, he lets you take over running of five fabulous parks. The only problem is that Uncle Mortimer&apos;s arch nemesis Vernon Garrison is trying to knock Thrillville off the map with his Globo-Joy chain of multi-conglomerate parks and will stop at nothing to crush Thrillville like a bug and become number one. The only way to stop him is to keep the parks running smoothly, this involves keeping the guests happy and finding out their needs and wants. Created by the team behind RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, the game moves away from pure management for the console systems. You can construct your own rides and test them yourself. Daily chores require you to construct new attractions and stalls, and customers need to be kept happy with reasonable prices. Instead of crunching numbers, some daily chores have been turned into mini-games based on classic games. Using shoot-em-ups, racing games and rhythm games, mundane tasks become exciting events. You can even participate in the games available for your visitors. Instead of being a god, acting with an invisible hand from the sky, you control a park manager to distribute the work and interact with customers. You can even try to befriend customers through conversations to keep them happy.</story>

    <story>This golfing simulation game is the 2007 multi-platform edition of Electronic Arts&apos; Tiger Woods PGA Tour franchise. Although the game&apos;s features differ across platforms, most notably from next-gen to current-gen, it has a few things in common across the board- more licensed players, more courses, more game modes, and improved GameFace character creation. Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on Xbox 360 and PS3 feature more realistic characters thanks to the all-new Universal Capture (UCAP) technology. UCAP is the same technique that was used on The Matrix films to generate digital doubles for the lead actors. Another next-gen-only feature that the Xbox 360 and PS3 share is larger crowds and mass movement of spectators from hole-to-hole, as well as PIP cameras. There is also an enhanced career mode where you can master your skills in a new Practice Facility. The golfers have a new animation state engine that yields more pertinent emotions and reactions based on what happens in gameplay. The game setup has been changed, with different swing styles, and the Speed Golf setting which allows players to skip to the next shot after the ball has been struck without watching where the ball lands. PS2 and Xbox versions of the game feature a new team tour mode where you can recruit your own squad of golfers to go up against Team Tiger Woods. The PC, PS2, and Xbox versions have the most licensed golfers (21) in the game. The Wii edition of the game features the ability to control your swing using the Wiimote.</story>

    <story>The 2008 edition in the Tiger Woods PGA series introduces enhancements and improvements to the previous version without major graphical or gameplay changes. There are new courses (Xbox 360/PS3- 5 new, 16 in total - PS2- 6 new, 18 in total) and different licensed professional golf players to choose from (21 on the Xbox 360/PS3 - 23 on the PS2/Wii). The Xbox 360, PS2, PS3 and Windows versions allow players to import photos to create in-game faces on the characters based on custom images, using the Xbox Live Vision camera, PlayStation EyeToy, PlayStation Eye or a webcam. Further customizations include clothing, hair or eye color and more. The initial statistics can be improved by completing challenges based on power or putting precision. They can also be raised by performing well in the PGA Tour, taking into account skill shots and not just the overall ranking. Players can unlock additional golfers and spend their winnings in the shop on new equipment. The game incorporates the FedExCup championship format (a collection of tournaments) with rounds of golf at Westchester Country Club, TPC Boston, Cog Hill, and East Lake. The putt preview has been improved, allowing the player to simulate the ball&apos;s path once per individual spot, taking into accounts elements such as power, speed and elevation. On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but with the 3-point timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player&apos;s performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii. The multiplayer (up to 4 players) has been expanded with GamerNet, where players can create and play custom challenges with their scores posted online (Xbox 360/PS3/Windows). On the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off. It can be used to influence air conditions, spin, or adds audio distractions. The controls are available in 3 modes- Full Swing (wii remote), Sitting Swing (new, waggle the wii remote) or the classic controls using the nunchuck for analog play. In Full Swing, twisting the wii remote adds hooks and slices prior to shots. Also exclusive to the Wii is a Miniputt mode.</story>

    <story>Tiger Woods is back for another round of golf in the 2004 edition of the best selling pro golf series. The biggest addition to this version is EA&apos;s Game Face, which lets you customize everything and anything. You have the basics, such as hair, skin, facial hair and other general appearances, but Game Face allows you to customize every other aspect, from teeth shape, logos, tattoos, headbands, hats, and more. You may also change individual body mass, muscle tone, mid-section, arms and legs. You also have the option of choosing specific swing style animations, post-putt and celebration animations, and pissed off animations for when you score a triple bogey. One of the new modes is World Tour, which puts you through a standard 52-week PGA tour to earn money, sponorships, and better gear. You can play for up to twenty seasons. The other new game mode is Battle Golf, where you can win an opponent&apos;s clubs if you beat them. All the other standard game modes are here, from Skill Challenge and Speed Golf to a Skins Match or Practice. A new feature is the game&apos;s ability to read your console&apos;s internal clock, and provide you with game modes. If it&apos;s near the end of October and your clock is properly set, you may be invited to a Halloween event where you can win items specific to that event. All top PGA players are included for you to play as (or against), including Vijay Singh and Justin Leonard. Newcomers to the sport have also been added, such as John Daly. Most of the courses from 2003 have made it, with seven new courses, both real and fantasy. One of the new courses is Bethpage Black, an extremely difficult course located in Washington. Like all other 2004 EA Sports console games, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 has the EA Sports Bio, which tracks your accomplishments and games over all EA Sports titles. The more EA Sports games you play, and the longer you play them, will increase your EA Gamer Level and unlock additional rewards, such as a new driver in Tiger Woods or historic teams in NHL 2004. This feature isn&apos;t on the PC version. Gamers who buy the PlayStation 2 version will be able to play online through EA&apos;s matchmaking service. You cannot play online with the Xbox or GameCube versions. If you buy the GameCube version, you can use the GameBoy Advance to hook up to the GameCube to unlock special rewards not available through normal play.</story>

The terrorist group has taken over an office center and wants to destroy the nuclear reactor buried deep beneath the complex. It&apos;s up to you, to stop them. The game play is like the rest of the series, where you are taking cover, trying to eliminate the enemies in a small area before a limited amount of time expires, with the time limit resetting when you finish the area and proceed to the next one. You don&apos;t control the player&apos;s movement as it is a rail shooter, meaning that your character moves in a pre-determined path, with enemies jumping in the screen to try and damage you. Hide behind your shield to avoid being shot, but you are also not able to shoot while behind it. The PS2 port can use the G-con 45 and G-Con2 light guns (with the last one being bundled sometimes with the game). Another different of the PS2 port from the arcade one is that the port features an extra mission (Grassmarket District that takes place 6 months after the Garland Square mission in which you have to rescue the daughter of S.T.F. Commander Kessler and clear the district from the remaining terrorists), along with some small minigames.</story>

    <story>The third title in the long running arcade shooter series has you again ducking and weaving through a range of levels, with the ultimate aim of defeating the enemy who wishes to take over the world. Along with the return of two player action, and the duck and shoot method (duck under cover by pressing the required button, which also reloads your gun), new additions to the franchise include the ability to use multiple weapons besides the pistol and machine gun. The shotgun and grenade launcher are added to your arsenal, although ammo is fairly low for both so you must aim for the right colored enemies to gain bonus ammo, or shoot crates and pick up the items. Besides the full conversion of the arcade game, there is also a collection of multiplayer bonus quests, plus once you complete the game straight through you&apos;ll unlock an exclusive single player hostage rescue campaign, including the option to use a sniper rifle.</story>

    <story>TimeSplitters 2, the sequel to Free Radical Design&apos;s PlayStation 2 launch title, once again sends players hurtling through time, as they battle the malevolent TimeSplitters in ten unique time periods, from the Wild West to a futuristic space station, and everything in between. The game&apos;s story finds Cortez, the series&apos; hero, on a quest to discover the origins of the TimeSplitters, an enigmatic group that travels through time causing trouble for the good people of Earth. Using the paradoxes of time travel to his advantage, the hero can regularly join up with past and future versions of himself, to fight the enemy as a team. A wide selection of historical, modern, and futuristic weapons is available, and environments feature destructible elements. Depending on the difficulty level chosen, players will find themselves with rudimentary objectives to complete or, on the harder settings, new areas and substantially more involved objectives to fulfill. Two players can also play the Story mode cooperatively and simultaneously. Like its predecessor, TimeSplitters 2 features a Challenge mode, which presents the player with a selection of time- and skill-based events. Completing these within the predetermined constraints awards the player with bronze, silver, or gold medals, which in turn aid in unlocking additional game options, levels, and playable characters (of which there are more than 120). The Arcade mode offers League, Custom, and Network sub-modes. League events feature pre-configured maps, game types, and objectives for the player to compete in, while the other Arcade modes make up the bulk of the multiplayer portion of the title. In the Custom mode, up to four players and numerous AI bots can compete in 16 different customizable disciplines including Deathmatch, Regeneration, Virus, Thief, Shrink, Monkey Assistant, and Flame Tag -- each offering an altered form of gameplay. Thief, for example, tasks players with collecting tokens left behind by fallen combatants. Here, the tokens determine the winner, not the number of kills.</story>

    <story>Cowabunga! Take control of your favourite turtle ninjas as you play through the events of the 2007 CGI movie. Leonardo returns from his meditation in South America to find his family in disarray, and crime on the rise in New York. A mysterious figure calling himself the Nightwatcher has turned up, and a shadowy rich man named Winters seems to be in cahoots with the remnants of the Foot Clan. Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets! TMNT is an action game, similar to Prince of Persia- The Sands of Time. Play as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello, swapping on the fly and using special co-operative moves to help your brothers in battle. Each turtle, being a ninja, can perform moves like double jumping, running along and up walls, gripping onto tiny cracks in the walls, and jumping from wall to wall to scale dizzying heights. Most of the game is spent making your way to the next destination by using your ninja moves to explore New York. Each character also has their own special move- Leo can traverse through walls, Raph can use his Sais to scale particular surfaces, Mikey can use his Nunchucks as helicopters to float for a short period, and Don can pole vault across long gaps with his Bo Staff. Sometimes, battles will occur - in these situations, you&apos;ll be locked in an arena and must battle all your enemies before you can move on. Battling is a simple affair - you can use one button for standard attacks (charge it for a more powerful one), and another button for light attacks that push enemies away. If your fellow turtles are with you, you can also hold down your character swap button for a tandem co-op attack. Some levels will allow you to play as the Nightwatcher - he fights similarly to the Turtles, except that as the more he fights, the more his &apos;rage&apos; builds, which can cause a devastating surrounding attack when fully charged. The Wii version of the game controls similarly to all other versions, except that gestures are used for attacking instead of button presses. The basic goal for each level is to get to the end. At the end of each level, you&apos;re graded on the following attributes- your speed, your combat, and the amount of coins collected. In levels where you work with your brothers, you&apos;ll also be graded on how well you worked together. Succeed in a these attributes, and you&apos;ll earn turtle coins which can be used to purchase unlockables. If you get an A Rank or higher in a level, you&apos;ll also unlock a Challenge Map, which can be played to earn even more turtle coins. Finally, once you&apos;ve played any level at least once, turtle coins will appear in hard-to-reach spots for you to collect.</story>

    <story>TOCA Race Driver 3 follows on from the ideas started in Race Driver 2. The game attempts to include as many different forms of four-wheeled racing in one game, as well as injecting each with a high degree of realism. The game has over 70 licensed cars and 80 real tracks, as well as 35 different disciplines of racing. There are two main gameplay modes. The World Tour mode has the player starting a racing career and, with the help of a Scottish manager, attempting to gain renown and acceptance into more famous racing events. There are 3D rendered cutscenes shown from the player&apos;s point-of-view, which move the story along and, while not as detailed as its predecessor, gives a good idea of the back scenes of a professional racer&apos;s life aside from just the racing. This mode includes mixtures from all the racing disciplines. The second mode allows the player to choose one discipline and play a career focused on that choice. This mode has no back-story and longer, more realistic races. TOCA Race Driver 3 provides two different driving models, Simulation and Pro-Simulation. The latter is recommended for gamers with analog steering wheels only. Simulation is intended for gamers without wheels, or who want an easier experience. This mode is also noticeably easier than the Simulation mode from TOCA Race Driver 2.</story>

    <story>The version of Ghost Recon- Advanced Warfighter released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox differs from both the Xbox 360 and the Windows version. The player takes the role of Captain Scott Mitchell, who is a squad leader of the Ghosts. The game takes place in Mexico City where separatists have attacked an North American summit, leading to the Canadian Prime Minister being killed and the Mexican and US president goes missing. Throughout the campaign the player will need to rescue the Presidents, recover a nuclear football and defeat the leader of the separatists. This version of the game is with a more streamlined level design a less tactical than the other versions of the game and is entirely played from a first person perspective. Although the story, mission objectives, weapons and characters as the Xbox 360 version, it has different level design and uses the UnrealEngine2 rather than the Yeti Engine. The player here only has one AI-controlled team mate with him and not a full squad. In this version the player isn&apos;table to go prone and can&apos;t jump over fences or climbing obstacles, instead the player is able to sprint. The multiplayer components differs between the versions. Both the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions feature online multiplayer, while local multiplayer is only available in the Xbox version. The Xbox version supports up to four players in split-screen and up to twelve players on Xbox Live or System Link. The campaign can also be player in co-op by two players. The PlayStation 2 version supports up to eight players online. Co-op is not available in the PlayStation 2 version.</story>

    <story>Lockdown is the third Rainbow Six game to appear on the consoles, this time with Red Storm Entertainment fully behind the wheel. Once again, you play as Domingo &apos;Ding&apos; Chavez, leading a small commando team on black-ops missions. This time, however, the developer strays from the realistic squad-based action in favor of more arcadish gameplay. The main single player campaign is based around a dangerous virus and hostages. In certain missions, you play as sniper Dieter Weber, picking off terrorists from higher ground and providing cover while the team infiltrates the building. The differences between the console versions are the number of missions and the availability of certain gadgets. There is an offline two-player, split-screen cooperative mode available (up to 4 over Xbox live) and full online multiplayer up to 16 players featuring traditional deathmatch, objective-based games and CTF modes, on Xbox and PS2. While the PS2 version includes a Rivalry mode, Xbox online multiplayer has an RPG element- the P.E.C. mode (Persistent Elite Creation). Before playing, you choose an avatar and a class with specific abilities (commando, engineer, spec op and medic). While playing, you earn credits and experience, which can be traded in for new weapons, items or amour. Gear regularly needs to be repaired, shown by the durability level, and experience can be used to assign skills points to abilities, individualizing your character.</story>

    <story>In 2007, an unidentified group of terrorists attack a number of high-profile targets, beginning with the G8 summit in Switzerland and continuing with a Venezuelan oil refinery in the Caribbean. Their demands are obviously targeted at disrupting the oil trade between the United States and Venezuela. Enter veteran international anti-terrorism unit Team Rainbow, who must stop the terrorists and discover who is behind the attacks. Rainbow Six 3 is an entry in the long-running series designed especially for consoles. It does away with the heavy strategy and planning elements the series was known for on the PC and offers an experience more focused on the first-person action. The game features 14 single-player levels (15 in the PS2 and GameCube versions). In each, the player controls Domingo &apos;Ding&apos; Chavez, who leads a team of three other Rainbow operatives. Goals in each mission include taking out terrorists, defusing bombs and protecting hostages. Ding&apos;s squad mates will act on their own in supporting the mission, but they can also be given specific orders through a context-sensitive menu- holding position, advancing, clearing a room or defusing a bomb. It&apos;s also possible to give delayed orders which are only carried out once a special signal is given. The Xbox version features voice recognition- team orders can be given through a headset. Before each mission, each squad member must be equipped with a primary and secondary weapon plus further equipment. More than two dozen realistic firearms are available, and there are also different types of grenades (hand-thrown or fired through a launcher), charges and mines, as well as a gas mask. Thermal and night vision are always available and don&apos;t require special equipment. Despite the action focus, the game still opts for a certain amount of realism- there is no running or jumping, more than a few hits are fatal and there is no way to regain lost health. Besides the single player campaign, there is also the custom mission mode, which allows the player to hunt terrorists on unlocked maps from the campaign. </story>

    <story>Set in the not too distant future, Japan creates the Information Self-Defense Force (I-SDF). The creation of this force is seen as a violation of international law and Japan&apos;s constitution, and it causes tensions to rise between Japan, China, and North Korea. In time, North Korea and China set up shipping blockades around Japan, and Japan calls on the United States for help, citing article nine of the Postwar Constitution. Throughout this time, Japan uncovers more and more information that the infamous Black Gold Day was caused by intentional information warfare attacks. As the U.S. prepares to launch the USS Clarence E. Walsh, Third Echelon sends the famous Sam Fisher on a mission that appears to be unrelated to the incident, but which may end up being the most important element of it all. In Splinter Cell- Chaos Theory, players take on the role of field operative Sam Fisher for a third outing. Fisher has some new moves this time around, and he also has a new weapon always at his disposal; a combat knife. Utilizing the knife, Sam can either kill his enemies, or simply knock them out. At the end of each mission, the player is given an overview of how they did. The more people that the player spares, the better the success score. The single-player game is more open-ended than the past two Splinter Cell games. While players are still forced through some areas in a &amp;quot;tunnel&amp;quot; like fashion, with no choice of where to go, there are many instances where they can decide how they&apos;d like to get there. For example, in the caverns, one can either kill two enemies and cross the bridge, or leave them alone, sneak along the side path, and climb a ladder at the end, bypassing the fight entirely, but still winding up in the same location. Throughout the game many different locations are visited, such as a lighthouse, a Japanese tea house, Seoul, New York City during an East Coast blackout, and other such exotic locales. The Spies-vs-Mercs multiplayer mode that appeared in the previous game has returned, with some new features. There are several new, large maps to play on, as well as updated versions from the past game. The PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox versions feature this mode.</story>

    <story>Once, Sam Fisher was an agent of Third Echelon, assigned to infiltrate strongholds belonging to enemies of National Security, gather information and neutralize enemies if needed. Times are changing, America&apos;s enemies are looking at new options, finding ways to make themselves more deadly. In order to star one step ahead of its target, Third Echelon is also changing and while Sam Fisher&apos;s foes are evolving and his allies are in flux, Fisher&apos;s own life will undergo some dramatic and permanent changes. And once that happens nothing will ever be the same. With his life turned upside down, Fisher is on a new mission unlike any he has ever been sent on before. Where he used to penetrate defenses and gather information from the outside, now he is on the inside, working with those he has sworn to destroy and finding enemies among his allies. He is risking everything for the sake of the greater good, even if it costs him his identity or his life. Play the game in a stealth manner or in a gun blazing way and your experience will be different every time you play. Try to sneak around the enemies and kill, interrogate or neutralize them without anyone else notice. There are 3 different endings depending on your choices in the game. Different settings will be visited during the game such as a prison, a boat in Cozumel, visit Africa, and many more. You will get many different weapons and gadgets to help you through your journey. Use gadgets to close the lights, use gadget to electrify enemies in water pond, and scan the surroundings using your many visions (electric, night vision, heat vision) to identify potential gameplay objects around the worlds. This version is quite different from the Xbox 360/Windows release. They share the same engine (although it is not multi-threaded), but this release adds an additional single-player mission with alternate ending, a new Spies vs. Spies online mode, 14 co-op missions playable offline (also online for the Xbox version), LAN, and 8 minutes of additional cinematics. There are also some changes in the storyline. The Wii/GameCube versions only have co-op multiplayer. The Spies vs. Spies multiplayer offers different game modes- 1. Team Hack- similar to capture the flag, but you need to hack the opponent&apos;s computer and secure your own. 2. Deathmatch- regular matches. 3. Team Deathmatch- regular team matches. 4. Key Run- similar to Team Hack, but with the addition of a key that needs to be obtained first to hack into the opponent&apos;s computer 5. Sam Vs. All- a single player, Sam Fisher, has to sneakily hack into computers defended by an entire team. 6. Countdown- similar to Deathmatch, with the addition of gameplay time provided by killing other players.</story>

    <story>In Pandora Tomorrow, you reprise your role as Sam Fisher, along with old friends Irving Lambert and Anna Grimsdottir. A terrorist has a disease which he plans to spread through the United States. He makes daily phone calls to an undisclosed location every day, delaying the release of the disease by one more day. As Fisher, you must find out who the terrorist is, where he is, who he is working for, and above all, stop him. In order to do this, you are taken all around the world, from Paris to Indonesia to the holy land Jerusalem. Sam comes equipped with his standard pistol and SC-20K. The SC has been improved, with an added scope with two levels of zoom. You have access to all the equipment from the first game, including Sticky Shockers, Diversion Cameras, Frag and Smoke Grenades. Sam has also learned some new moves. He has the ability to perform a SWAT turn, which allows him to pass from one side of an open door to the other without being spotted. He may perform a half-split jump, enabling him to lean against one side of a wall to give him boost to jump higher. He can also whistle, to attract the attention of any nearby enemies. Pandora Tomorrow also has a full fledged multiplayer game, playable on Xbox Live. The multiplayer ties in to the single player campaign, and it pits the Shadownet team (spies) against the Argus team (mercs). The game supports four players. Members of Shadownet must infiltrate various complexes to retrieve canisters of a deadly liquid, but they must watch out for cameras, motion sensors and trip lasers, all of which alert the mercs to their position. The spy cannot kill with weapons, but he can stun the mercs for several seconds in order to sneak up and kill from behind. On the other side, the mercs must make their way to each canister, guarding it from the Shadownet team. Whenever an alarm is tripped, the merc is instantly alerted to where the spy is. To help fight the Shadownets, the mercs have a built-in motion sensor view, which picks up any moving objects, as well as an electromagnetic view, which picks up on spy gadgets. The mercs come equipped with a rifle, and must defend the viral canisters at all costs. Multiplayer comes with a good variety of maps, ranging from a warehouse and a factory to a cinema and three towering skyscrapers. More maps will be available in the future via Xbox Live.</story>

    <story>In Splinter Cell, you take on the role of Sam Fisher, an operative for the secret organization Third Echelon. SC is a third-person stealth based game, similar to Metal Gear Solid. Third Echelon is a secret organization, a part of the U.S. government. The organization deals with very sensitive missions, and you play as Sam, Third Echelon&apos;s splinter cell. Your missions are so discreet, that if you are captured, the government will deny any such existence of that organization. Since it&apos;s a stealth based game, you have a variety of moves at your disposal. You can walk, run, crouch, jump, rappel, shimmy, cross horizontal wires, zip using a zip cord, and do a split jump. To defeat your enemies, you have a variety of means. You can use your weapons, but the noise might alert a guard. You can stun them, kill them, subdue them, jump down from the ceiling and knock them unconcious. Some enemies are needed to activate a door or passcode, so you can take an enemy hostage by holding a gun to his head, you can interrogate them, or you can use them as human shields. Some of the more innovative features of the game is the ability to peak through a door before going through. You can open it up a bit to peak through, or you can use your optic cable camera (a snake camera) to peer through the underside of the door, checking to make sure it&apos;s clear. Being a stealth based game, your arsenal is small. You have an automatic rifle that can be fitted with a silencer and other modifications, and you also have a trusty pistol. Splinter Cell also has downloadable content, so you can download new items in the future, specifically new levels and missions.</story>

    <story>A mighty syndicate gives Lara Croft the task to find the Scion, a mystical artifact which is said to be the key to the secret of Atlantis. Since her father already searched for this item, Lara does not hesitate and begins her journey through ancient tombs and forgotten worlds. Lara Croft Tomb Raider- Anniversary is essentially a remake of the original Tomb Raider. So you fight and riddle your way through familiar sites and meet good old enemies. But also you feel at home, the game features everything that Lara Croft Tomb Raider- Legend has. So besides the better graphics, Lara also has many new moves, such as swinging on ropes, bullet time when an animal rushes towards her, and the addition of a grappling hook in her inventory (which resembles the one from the original game). Jumping is also a lot easier, as the heroine automatically grabs the ledges without requiring pixel-precise timing. There are also completely new moves, where Lara balances and jumps on small sticks. The cut-scenes are identical, but rendered in real-time using the new engine. Some are also action-based, like in the previous games, requiring quick reflexes to keep the action going. The environments and riddles have been changed to fit the new gameplay and the voice recording was also redone.</story>

    <story>Legend is the seventh major game in the Tomb Raider series, now for the first time developed by Crystal Dynamics, along with the original character designer of the game&apos;s protagonist Lara Croft- Toby Gard. Heroine Lara is searching for a South American relic, but her adventure takes a different course when rogue anthropologist Amanda Evert shows up. Presumed dead along with a team of graduate students after an accident in a tomb in Peru, where Lara was the only one to escape, Amanda is back with a score to settle as they both race, along with the shady James Rutland Jr., to obtain an ancient artifact. Many other characters, both friends and foes, will stir things up. The story takes Lara through locations all over the world, from the Himalayas to Ghana, Kazakhstan, Bolivia, Japan and England, including her famous mansion filled with secrets and collectibles. Aside from current events, Lara&apos;s past is also revealed, through flashbacks. Among other things, you will get to know how she lost her mother and why it is such a burden. The typical third-person action-adventuring exploring is still present. Lara can move more freely, and is no longer limited by specific jumps. As you travel through rough environments, you will need to run, dive, swim, climb on poles, ladders, roofs, use zip lines, shimmy and vault, with acrobatic actions such as somersaults and flips. You need to cross difficult terrain, solve puzzles to advance or open up new areas, and engage in combat. New tools include a grappling hook, not only used to move around but also to haul enemies Scorpion-style, binoculars, a PLS (personal light source), flares, a PDA and a headset to keep in contact with tech support Zip. Enemies are still rather scarce. Both humans and animals will attack you, and the game retains the auto lock-on mode, but now with a slide attack and close combat with both kicks and punches, plus bullet-time actions to get behind enemies quickly. Lara carries her trademark dual-wielded pistols, but can also pick up new weapons along the way, such as a shotgun and grenades. Missions take place in both indoor and outdoor environments, with arcade motorcycle and jeep sequences in between. As usual, Lara has a fancy outfit for each location. The PSP version includes the full game and adds a multiplayer mode- Tomb Trials. You can race another player through tombs to see who comes out first, or go on a timed scavenger hunt for artifacts.</story>

    <story>Tomb Raider- Underworld concludes the story of Lara&apos;s search for her mother who is supposedly trapped in a place called Avalon. Continuing the events from Lara Croft Tomb Raider- Legend and Lara Croft Tomb Raider- Anniversary, her search brings her once again to locations around the globe from the cold wastes of the Arctic to the beautiful landscapes of Thailand. This time even the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea is not save from Lara&apos;s exploring. At the same time the game continues to explore the idea of monomyth, this time incorporating the influences of the Norse mythology into its narrative. The basic gameplay remains the same as in most of the previous iterations of the series with the focus on exploring, solving riddles and dodgy climbing passages instead of instant action and gun fights. For this Lara once again learned a few new moves including jumping between the walls introduced in Prince Of Persia- The Sands Of Time. To help the players with the riddles, the game not only features a sonar map, showing Lara&apos;s immediate surroundings as a 3D grid for better orientation around the levels. Also, if asked, Lara gives general but helpful tips on what to do next. The differences from the previous Tomb Raider games developed by Crystal Dynamics include the complete lack of QTE events. Instead the time slows down in critical moments, but the player still retains full control of the Lara&apos;s movements. Another change is the more non-linear level design more in vein with the traditional entries of the series.</story>

    <story>THPS4 is the fourth game in Activision&apos;s ever popular franchise. The main feature of this game is it&apos;s redesigned career mode. When beginning a level, you have all the time in the world to skate around, perform tricks, get a feel for the level, without the hassel of any goals or time limits. When you&apos;re ready to attempt a goal, simply find a pro skater, talk to him, then receive the goal, similar to Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX. Goals are similar to the previous games, such as collect SKATE, get a certain amount of points, transfer over this and grind that. There are new goals, however, such as collecting the word COMBO while doing one big combo. Miss a trick, and goal fails. Once all regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt the Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, and is extremely hard. All the major skaters are here, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie Thomas. The levels are been expanded and are huge. Some of the levels include a college campus, a shipyard, and the infamous prison complex Alcatraz. For multiplayer, all the favorite modes are back, from Graffiti and Trick Attack to Horse and King Of The Hill. New modes include Capture The Flag and Combo Mambo. THPS4 also supports System Link play, but not XBox Live. The PlayStation 2 version offers everything from the XBox version, but also has online play, utilizing either your own network adaptor or the official one. The PS2 version also features a one level demo of Shaun Murray&apos;s Pro Wakeboarder, which is not featured on any other version of the game.</story>

    <story>In Tony Hawk&apos;s Project 8, The Birdman is out looking for the top 8 skaters for his new Project and it happens that he has stopped in your city to search for the best top skaters. It is up to you to prove that you can make the cut among the 200 other people varying for the coveted 8 spots. You are start out ranked 200th with various goals set for you throughout the city including the return of classic mode from the early Tony Hawk games. Chances to rank up come in various different ways now. There are spray painted lines located throughout the city to mark a type of goal. Weather it is grinding a certain distance, completing Natas spins, keeping your balance while doing a manual for a certain time and distance, point combos, and trick combos. Also players can obtain missions via random strangers located throughout the city. Players can also earn Stokens by performing tricks to impress the locals that can be found wandering around the city. Players can use these Stokens to buy additional clothing, haircut styles, shoes, tricks, and boards from the store. New to this game is the slow motion Nail the Trick mode where the focus is placed on the skater&apos;s feet and the movement of the board can be controlled with both of the analog sticks to build up a huge combo score! The PSP version includes 14 multiplayer modes and 8 classic levels including Hawaii, Alcatraz and The Mall. The PS2, PS3 and Xbox version do not support online multiplayer.</story>

    <story>Tony Hawk&apos;s Proving Ground is a sequel to Tony Hawk&apos;s Project 8, this time letting the player be able to choose their own storyline by making different choices during the game with the ability to skate in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington D.C. There are four different classes of skaters (Rigger, Hardcore, Career and Street), which influences the story&apos;s direction. It also features an expanded Nail-the-Trick system with moves such as Nail-the-Grab and Nail-the Manual, Bowl Carving, Aggro Push, Skate Checking, Climbing/Exploration, Environment Altering, and Rig-a-Kit. During the game the player can get advice from professional skaters to help mold their own created skater and learn new moves and tricks and has the ability to create their own skate park. Unlike the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, the PlayStation 2 and Wii editions do not offer online multiplayer but still share the main story. Gameplay is however much different on the PlayStation 2 using the analog controller while the Wii uses the remote and nunchuk during certain motions to pull off various tricks. There are also different characters in these versions.</story>

    <story>The fifth game in the series, Tony Hawk&apos;s Underground is the first game to have a true career mode. You begin the game as a local skater whom nobody knows. Your board is wearing thin, and your tired of being a nobody. As your out skating, you see a flyer for a pro who&apos;s coming to your city to demo. You go to the skate demo and watch. Afterwards, you try to impress the pro, and he gives you advice on how to go about becoming a star. With your friend, Eric, you&apos;re now on your way to becoming a legend. THUG takes you to various cities to perform different goals. You begin in New Jersey, which acts as a sort of training stage, where goals are simple. Eventually, you&apos;ll visit Manhattan, Vancouver, Moscow, Tampa, San Diego and Hawaii. Most cities are split into different chapters, with each chapter opening new goals. THUG introduces a new system; walking. You can get off your skateboard to run or walk around the level. If there&apos;s a high tower you want to jump off of, get off your board, climb to the tower (by climbing a ladder or shuffling across a wire), get back on your board, and jump down. One of the new tricks associated with this is the Acid Drop, which can launch you off an opposing pipe, allowing you to pull off 1080&apos;s and up. Also new to THUG is the ability to drive certain vehicles, like a gardener&apos;s truck, a sports car, or a leaf blower. These are used for goals, but can be unlocked to drive whenever and wherever. Next to the standard Create-a-Park and Create-a-Skater, you can now create your own decks and your own tricks. The biggest feature is Create-a-Goal. You can create custom goals for one of the levels (or your own), and choose what pedestrian will give it to you, his/her dialogue, and what they&apos;ll say when you win. The PlayStation 2 version supports online play.</story>

    <story>Tony Hawk&apos;s Underground 2 is the sixth game in the Tony Hawk series. As an aspiring pro skater, you&apos;re invited to join Tony Hawk in an around-the-world underground skating competition known as the World Destruction Tour. It&apos;s Team Hawk against Team Bam in a no-holds-barred contest to gain the most points by performing insane stunts and raising havoc in cities all over the world. THUG 2&apos;s story mode basically follows the same formula as THUG, in which you have to complete a number of goals before you can move on to the next city. Re-introduced into the series is the Classic Mode wherein you have 2 minutes to complete as many goals as possible on any of THUG 2&apos;s levels and 6 remade classic levels. THUG 2 has all-new unlockable characters, vehicles, levels. All the Create-A-Modes from THUG are present, with the addition of the new Create-A-Graphic mode where you can make your own graffiti design with layers of text and predefined graphics, then use it to tag up during gameplay. THUG 2 supports online play (Playstation 2 only) and 2-player split-screen modes in a variety of new and classic multiplayer games.</story>

    <story>Torino 2006 is the official game of the XX Winter Olympic Games held in Turin, Italy, and the eight in the line of multi-event IOC licensed titles. The game includes 15 events scattered on 8 disciplines- Alpine Skiing (Downhill, Super G, Giant Slalom and Slalom), Ski Jump (Normal and Large hill), Speed Skating (500m, 1000m and 1500m), Women&apos;s Biathlon, Nordic Combined, Bobsled (Womens&apos; 2 and Mens&apos; 4), Luge and Cross Country. All venues were modelled after their real counterparts. Gameplay, as expected, requires more reflexes than the button-bashing of their Summer counterparts. Alpine Skiing is a matter of skill and quick reflexes, as the player, other than set the direction, only has to choose when to crouch to gain speed (mostly in Downhill and Giant Slalom) and when to carve the snow for sharper turns (either to correct a bad trajectory or approach a tighter gate). These events are based on a simplified version of the engine that power Ski Alpin 2006, also by 49Games. Unlike most other games that feature alpine skiing, the penalty for missing gate depends on the difficulty level chosen- on easy, six misses are allowed, three in medium and none on hard, each carrying a time penalty that depending on how well the player did can just affect the total score or mean losing a medal. Ski Jump (also a simplified version of another game, RTL Skispringen 2006) requires the player to keep the balance while descending the hill, jumping at the correct time, counter the effect of the wind in the athletes&apos; balance for maximum distance and then land in perfect telemark fashion. Cross Country and Biathlon are relaxed disciplines where all that counts is keeping the best trajectory possible while looking out for straight paths that can be used for short sprints and downhill slopes that can be done while crouching, which allows greater speeds and lower fatigue accumulated from sprints and more hasty climbs. Biathlon is pretty much the same as Cross Country, except it also includes two shooting sessions, with the steadiness of the aim affected by the fatigue levels. Skating disciplines require a strong, well timed start, and then accurate button pressing as the skater makes each step. Bobsled and Luge are similar with only two differences- The startup in Bobsled is done by following the on-screen cues and press up on the right time and other than setting the direction, it&apos;s also possible to make minimal path changes. The winner is the fastest competitor after two heats (instead of the official four). Nordic Combined is a Large hill ski jump which sets the start time for each competitor in the Cross country section. It&apos;s possible to compete in all 15 or just 9 events, or even create your own competition, with up to four competitors. At each competition the players aim for both medals and the score table, based on the results on each individual event. However, the challenge does not stop with winning medals. The player can unlock additional strips by completing challenges, such as hitting all 10 targets in Biathlon, having a perfect Bobsled start, winning a gold medal and beat each top record on every event or not missing a single step on Speed Skating. The difficulty level affects events differently- in Alpine skiing, it means CPU-controlled players are faster and fewer gate misses are allowed, in Ski jump wind can appear from any direction and in Speed skating, in addition to set the pace, the player also has to steer the athlete to keep her in the best path.</story>

Of course, motorcycles don&apos;t handle like cars. This is reflected in-game by giving you control over your rider&apos;s side-to-side leaning to affect cornering. Of course, all the standard simulation elements of braking, positioning, throttle control and condition of your ride are important as well. The game is divided into two main modes. Arcade mode allows you to do timed runs, quick races against AI opponents or split-screen racing. The main mode, Tourist Trophy, first puts you through a series of licensing tests. Each license opens up a group of challenges or races. Each challenge or race corresponds to a motorcycle, which you can earn by winning it. There is no cash in this game. Some events also unlock further events, of course. Bikes are customizable. You can set the tire compound, brakes, shocks, gear ratio and exhaust. Riders have even more options. Not only can they wear a variety of licensed clothing, their riding style is customizable, allowing you to adjust things like the position they take in leans, which affects handling. In addition to these Tourist Trophy also features a photography mode, which allows you to take pictures of the game in action and save them to a USB flash drive or print them directly from a printer attached to your PlayStation 2.</story>

    <story>The toys are back in town and at last they&apos;ve got a video game to equal the brilliance of the movies. You can relieve the story from the new film if you want, but there&apos;s much more to this game than the usual film tie-in. The best bit of this game is the exclusive Toy Box mode, where you can play as Woody, Buzz or Jessie in the role of Sheriff in a toyland town. This mode uses all the same characters from the films but gives you complete freedom to play with all of them however you want - from exciting car (or horse and dragon) races to catching ghosts. One special element of the Toy Box is magic goo that can change the size of any of the characters, which together with all the other collectable objects lets you completely customise the town, and the world of Toy Story, however you want. </story>

    <story>Transformers- Revenge of the Fallen is a game based on the movie of the same name. The Story Set a few years after the defeat of Megatron in the first game/movie, Transformers- Revenge of the Fallen reveals that the threat from the Decepticons has in fact, far from ended. Since the end of the first movie Decepticons have began popping up again all over Earth. They are in search of a mysterious object from space that will gift the balance of power. The Gameplay Transformers- Revenge of The Fallen is a linear third-person shooter that puts the player in control of many of the main characters from the movie, as the game shifts you between both Autobot and Decepticon factions. The story line is told via intro and outro cut scene videos that also allow for the player to easily transition from one character to the other. Playable characters on the Autobot side include- Optimus Prime, Iron Hide, Jetfire, Bumblebee. The Decepticon side includes- Starscream, Sideways (a new character), and Megatron. Though the game doesn’t allow transform wherever you want, transformation has been introduced as special attacks during robot mode, as fixed alternate game modes (driving Shanghai tunnels as Sideways, and fly through the skies of Russia as Starscream) and, in both robot and vehicle modes, as special moves that give you alternate abilities (i.e. Transforming as Starscream while flying till enable you to fly backwards as a robot to take out enemies behind you). For multiplayer, at any point during a single-player campaign a friend can join in as a Remote Weapon System, which allows them to shoot enemies, erect a shield to defend and transfer energon between you both.</story>

    <story>Based on the 2007 movie, Transformers- The Game puts players in the role of either the Autobot or Decepticon factions in an attempt to find the AllSpark, the artifact which gave life to their race. The Autobots intend to protect it for good, while the Decepticons desire its power for evil. The two factions fought their battle on the planet Cybertron, but in an ultimate attempt to protect it, the Autobots hurled the AllSpark into space where it remained hidden on Earth. When the Decepticons discover the location, they want to finish the war on Earth. Set in a 3D sandbox environment with possibilities to interact and destroy the environment, players can choose between the two teams, each with different story-based goals. These are set on different locations, with primary and secondary quests. The storyline for the heroic Autobots follows the plot and events of the original movie. The storyline for the villainous Decepticons, however, allows the robots to destroy both the planet and more aggressively bring an end to their foes. Players can choose characters such as Optimus Prime or Bumblebee from the list of selectable Autobots, or Megatron and Starscream from the Decepticons. Shown from a third-person perspective, the robots can switch between a robot and a vehicle/aircraft form, jump, block, dive underground, roll, dodge, use various weapons, and climb buildings. Special actions can be unlocked through the skill tracker. By performing long slides or jumps, symbols in the tracker will light up and provide extras. Along the way, various collectibles can be found, ranging from promo images and artwork, to playable versions of the original Generation 1 characters. The general gameplay is identical across the different platforms, but certain features are tied to specific versions.</story>

    <story>On the planet of Cybertron, the Transformer war between the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons rages on. But the losses are mounting up, and the war&apos;s front has been pushed into the heart of Autobot territory. The Autobots’ last stand takes a turn for the worse when the Decepticons introduce their secret weapon- the new Decepticlone army. As if by fate, a distress signal from the Mini-Cons, the long-lost third Transformer race, blasts onto the battlefield. Knowing that the Mini-Cons will tip the balance of power, the Autobots and the Decepticons race to Earth. On Earth, the Decepticons and their army invade the planet with extreme prejudice. It is then up to the Autobots to save Earth and prevent the Decepticons from controlling the universe. The player takes control of one of 3 featured Autobots and can switch between them for any mission. These are- Optimus Prime, Hot Shot and Red Alert. All have the ability to transform into their vehicle modes, with classic &apos;80s transforming sound effects. Players have to find and retrieve Mini-Con robots (of which there are over 40), which then function as weapons or equip the Autobot with new abilities. These add-ons include offensive weapons such as Missile Launchers, Limpet Mines, a Tractor Beam, Electric Arc Guns, Ribbon Beams, etc.; defensive abilitles such as Shields, Armours and Recharges; and Abilities such as Glide Wings, Boost Jumps, and Dashes. The player must battle the Decepticons and their Decepticlone army through a range of environments including the Amazon jungle, desolate Antarctica and a rugged Pacific island. Level enemies take the form of uniquely-designed Decepticlones - champions from an army of robots created to serve the Decepticons. All of the famous Decepticons are featured as game Bosses - including Starscream, Cyclonus, Tidal Wave (as a full-scale Aircraft Carrier/robot) and of course... the Decepticon leader, Megatron.

    <story>In Trapt, the player takes on the role of Princess Allura, horrified by the sudden murder of her father the King of Fronenburg and worse, being framed for his murder by step mother - Queen Catalina, later forced unwillingly to flee the castle with her maid Rachel. Fleeing her pursuers, she takes refuge in a forbidden castle, known through rumors as the place where an evil being only known as the Fiend was imprisoned. It was not by coincidence she was led here, as it turns out she was chosen by the Fiend to become her servant and wielder of the evil power the Fiend possesses. This power transforms the once innocent princess into a brutal Trapmaster capable of summoning and activating traps at will to the unwary enemy. The game starts in this castle and the unfolding of this new-found power as well as the attempts of Princess Allura and her allies in thwarting the plans of Queen Catalina. Trapt set is in medieval Europe of which, most of the game play is located in and around castle rooms, though not specifically limited to the aforementioned castle. Gameplay of Trapt consists the following- 1. Traps/Info Screen In this section the player has access to various important information to prepare for the upcoming mission/story, such as traps and items that may be bought (providing you have enough money), upcoming enemies and their stats in the next mission, and room information of areas available for access in addition to what traps are already located there. Real-Time Combat This is where the real game play occurs, 3rd person perspective view of the character and her surroundings. Most of the game play consists killing off enemies by placing traps to the unwary pursuer. The Princess cannot fight personally (only run) so the player has to rely on the traps to survive. Unlike other similar games with a trap system, in Trapt the traps are not automatically set. The player have to activate them manually by pressing the appropriate triggers (via buttons) to activate the traps. The 3 different button/triggers represent 3 different traps- Floor traps, Ceiling traps, and Wall traps. These are the only traps the player has direct access to. Other traps or devices are also located in the many rooms. The player can link/connect them with other traps to create combos at the displeasure of the enemy. The more combo&apos;s, the more money the player acquires, of which means the more traps the player can purchase for future planning. Placing traps can be done at any point during this real-time setting, which is basically the uniqueness of your powers. This means you can move and place traps around, even when the enemy is chasing you. However, traps have to recharge- after it is placed and after it is sprung, so timing is also crucial here.</story>

Shown from a third-person perspective players need to visit typical locations such as villas, restaurants and casinos to take down members of the opposing family. Next to the basic action missions there is some focus on stealth and escorting too. Some sections require a key to be found in order to progress. While fighting, there is a focus on head shots, as enemies can take a lot of bullets in other body parts before going down. There are eight missions in total. There are different types of weapons including a blade, machine guns and sniper rifles, but only a small amount of clips can be carried. Enemies hardly ever leave anything behind, so ammo crates need to be hunted down.</story>

These points can allow you to gain the ability to roll again if you don&apos;t like your roll. Flash mode is for those who want a quick game. There are 5 levels of the board. You start on the first level and have a choice of 2 spaces. Answer correctly and move up a level for another 2 spaces to choose from. The first to the top wins. Questions are asked from the 6 different categories depending on what space you are on. Each question has a multiple choice selection of 4 possible answers to choose from. The only exception is with the 50/50 spaces in Unhinged mode where there are only 2 possible answers to choose from. The questions are read by famous people like Bill Nye the Science Guy and Whoopi Goldberg.

Due to your extreme methods of policing and your ability to cause massive amounts of property damaged, you are suspended, only to be recruited by the EOD (Elite Operations Division), where your reckless attitude is a plus. 240 square miles of Los Angeles has been accurately rendered for you to cause havoc in. As a cop, you must behave when doing your duty. The game has a good cop/bad cop system, that gives you points based on what you do. Beat up an innocent pedestrian or run over a criminal that&apos;s surrendered and your rating will go down. Eventually, you can lose stats you&apos;ve built up. Arrest a surrendering criminal or frisk an innocent that&apos;s acting suspicious, and your rating will go up, enabling you to upgrade certain aspects. There are two main modes of getting around; on foot or in car. You can hijack (or, in police terms, commedate) various cars. Sports cars, sedans, etc. are yours for the taking. Each has various handling and stats. Since you&apos;re a well trained cop, you&apos;re capable of firing your weapon while driving. In an open top vehicle, you can aim anywhere. The other method is walking. While walking, you may encounter the odd street crime or suspicious looking pedestrian, which will let you get good or bad points, depending. True Crime features a branching storyline with three different endings, depending on how good or bad you are. In missions where you&apos;re required to do something, failing does not mean repeating the mission. If you fail to tail someone to a hideout, you&apos;ll have a harder time finding that hideout in a later mission, whereas if you capture someone, your next mission will be easier. Aside from gunplay, you&apos;re well trained in martial arts. You can pull off various punch and kicks, as well as combos. You can also grapple and possibly throw someone, ala a wrestling move.</story>

    <story>Tsugunai- Atonement tells the story of a mercenary named Leise. By removing a treasure orb from its sacred pedestal, he angers the God of Light. Now, his body is separated from his soul, and he must atone for his sin by helping the people of Waldonia. Leise&apos;s soul can possess bodies of different people, each one of which has different strengths and weaknesses in combat. The combat in Tsugunai- Atonement is precision-oriented. There are four main defensive moves- block, strage counter, back step, and counter attack. You must press a button at a certain time during the corresponding animation. You will also obtain runes of various shapes during the game, which will enable offensive and healing magic. Those runes can be places in amulets, and once an amulet is filled with runes, a summon spell becomes available.</story>

TM-B also boasts a multiplayer mode, with 1-4 multiplayers, over ten arenas (some specific to multiplayer), and a cooperative mode, so instead of fighting each other, you can work together.

The player at the end of the time limit with the most artifacts wins. Also, if you collect all the artifacts before time is up, you win. In Manhunt, one of the players becomes the prey and the others, the hunters.</story>

    <story>This is a conversion of the PSP version of Twisted Metal- Head-On, but with some differences. One of the changes is the inclusion of four lost levels of a new Twisted Metal game that was never finished (it was cancelled after six members of the production team died in a plane crash). It features the characters from Twisted Metal- Black, but with new stories (unfortunately, no endings were done for them) and two extra characters, 12-Pak and Gold Tooth. The levels are a massive suburban area, a giant stadium, a local carnival and a ship yard. Another feature is the ability to walk around in an asylum as Sweet Tooth, a feature that was being worked on for the new Twisted Metal that was going to be used for character based foot missions. In it you can roam the asylum and collect Sweet Tooth shaped heads that include facts about the history of the Twisted Metal series. Includes documentaries of the history of Twisted Metal and live action videos of endings for the original Twisted Metal on the Playstation that looks like old, worn out videotape, some of which have completely different endings from the final versions, even making Sweet Tooth sound almost like Mick Mankind Foley of WWE/WWF fame.</story>

    <story>TY the Tasmanian Tiger 2 is a 3D Platformer with an Australian theme. The player takes the role of TY, a Tasmanian tiger, armed with sharp teeth and boomerangs a-plenty. On TY&apos;s quest to defeat the evil Boss Cass and his army of cold-blooded Frilled Lizards, he must assist the colorful residents of Burramudgee Town and the Southern Rivers, who include a tree frog, a lyre bird, a platypus family, some kangaroos and more koalas than you can shake a didgeridoo at. While most of the game is standard platform fare, there are some diversions. Notably, there are a number of cart racing tracks which can be played with a friend. Additionally, there are missions that will place the player in giant robots, each with a different speciality (one is good at battle, one can put out fires, one is a submarine, etc.). There are many comedic quirks, having the players throw electrified boomerangs at robotic dinosaurs in the Outback, then send them up in a helicopter to rescue sheep stranded by a flood, then have them clear a road following a traffic accident. And finally, to top it all off, the save/continue points are outhouses.</story>

The Quinkan have invaded Southern Rivers, and even worse, the Bush Rescue team from the previous game has disbanded during Ty&apos;s absence! It&apos;s up to Ty to reunite his team members, as well as stop the Quinkan from unleashing the mysterious Quinking, an evil being of supreme power. Night of the Quinkan is the third game in the Ty series. As Ty, players can bite at foes, or use his boomerangs for consecutive ranged attacks. Boomerangs can be customized in an assortment of ways- either by changing the chassis (each chassis has its own special abilities); or by equipping special Bunyip Stones to the boomerang&apos;s chassis. Some stones can be combined with others, allowing players to customize their attacks to their liking. Some stones are rewards for completing tasks; others, as well as boomerang chassis, can be purchased from the Rang Shop in exchange for Opals, the game&apos;s currency. Ty 3 again rolls out the robotic mechs - choose from the Shadow or Extreme Bunyip (your standard mech), the Crabmersible (a submarine shaped like a crab, oddly enough), or the Gunyip (a speedy airplane with an assortment of bombs and guns). Ty can even take part in cart races against other characters for powerups and even more opals.</story>

    <story>After many years under Eidos/Silicon Dreams ownership and development, EA releases the official Champions League game for the 2004/2005 season. The last rehash of the engine debuted on FIFA 2003, it draws most of it&apos;s gameplay elements from the 2005 edition, but with some changes to gameplay such as a slightly more aggressive AI on attack (reducing the need to constantly push players forward using the Off The Ball controls, still present), new refereeing aspects such as some deliberate errors (as in occasional bad offside calls or throw-ins, not cheating the player through mistakes), advantage rule and handballs and a new set piece system, which replaces the much criticized targeting and push and shove featured in 2005. This system is much less rigid and less formulaic, as a directional arrow and powerbars define how balls are crossed and there are four player movement setups, thus making each corner and indirect free kicks different. For direct free kicks, players have the option to take driven or curved shots or drop a pass to a nearby player to explore a gap in the defense. All options are available at all times, instead of being determined by the distance to goal. Many of these changes were later adapted into the new FIFA 06 engine, and it was also chosen as the match engine for subsequent Bright Future&apos;s FIFA Manager. The presentation takes notes from real television broadcasts, with goals, fouls and attempts on goal being recapped not only in the full-time highlight reel but also during game stoppages and PiP popups. As the game is presented in a faux letterboxed format, next to the scoreline some statistics occasionally popup, allowing to keep track of them for some missions. A very requested feature, the ability to see the energy bars of the closest players to the ball of both teams, was finally included, as well as icons for the special abilities (speed, shooting, dribbling or tackling) of the best players. The Champions League, where the player leads one team to the Final in the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, in the quest to succeed FC Porto as European Champions, is one of the available modes, but not the most important. That honour goes to the The Season mode, where the player starts by creating his managing avatar, and then proceeds to a a series of 50 missions, with the first being a close last-week match against a Champions League spot rival, proceeding with a buyout of the club and increased expectations, and (hopefully) closing with the Champions League final. This mode also allows players to unlock additional features such as balls, a stadium and special exhibition modes by fulfilling objectives set by the club president during the season, some of them crucial matches (which can result in a sacking if failed), others simply a matter of balancing the squad. Other modes include the usual friendlies, home and away (a two-legged friendly), scenarios (where the player can create situations such as a defending a 1-0 nil for 45 minutes while two man down) and practice.</story>

You can also play a very extensive challenge mode where you try to make you nation the best in European football by clearing different challenges against all the other European teams. As with FIFA 08 the PC and console versions are quite different. In fact, they are based on completely different game engines. While the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3-versions boasts state of the art graphics and a new and improved control system, the PC-version still basically looks and functions like the 2006-version.</story>

    <story>Ultimate Mind Games is a collection of mini games that can either be played in story mode or individually. In story mode the player takes the role of a child with special powers, because their parents can move between board game world, Brun, and another they too have this ability. On returning to the Brun one day the player is met by their friend Mana who informs them that the town is deserted because they have been invaded. The whole country has been invaded by the kingdom of Jejune and board games are banned! Mana takes the player to resistance HQ and explains that, because the player is so good they must tour round all the towns on the world map, play games in each location improve morale and weaken the invaders grip. More money can be earned by gambling or by taking part in the Sunday matches at the coliseum. Time in Brun is measured in weeks. Every Monday supporters of the resistance will pay in their money, on the same day the Jejune invaders will increase their hold in all regions by five percent. Money earned can be used to lobby citizens in a region to support the resistance, this is the game mechanic that allows players who are bad at one of the featured games, say Chess, to take control of that region without having to win at that game. </story>

    <story>When 15-year-old Peter Parker was bitten by a genetically altered spider he became faster, stronger, more agile and gained the spider-like ability to cling to walls. Add web shooters and a costume and Peter becomes Spider-Man. Eddie Brock, Jr. is Peter’s childhood friend. In search of his scientist father’s legacy, Eddie came in contact with a symbiotic suit which transformed him into the monstrous Venom. Ultimate Spider-Man follows both their Brian Michael Bendis-scripted adventures, as Spidey attempts to prevent Venom from killing innocents while Venom seeks to avoid S.H.I.E.L.D.’s machinations. The Ultimate version of the Spider-Man mythos revamps the franchise, bringing in edgier (and often younger) versions of famous superheroes and supervillains. The Human Torch, Wolverine, Electro, and Green Goblin are some of the Ultimate characters who make appearances. Ultimate Spider-Man features a fully rendered, cel-shaded Manhattan open to exploration. With few exceptions, Spider-Man and Venom can explore Manhattan and Queens, climbing, jumping, and web swinging away. Story missions show up as hot spots on the map as do other in-game objectives. When the player is done patrolling (or destroying) the city, they can hit these hot spots to advance the story. Between story missions, Spider-Man and Venom can follow race paths, go on combat tours, discover and collect hidden icons, and help (or hurt) the citizens of New York.</story>

    <story>The Ultimate TV &amp; Film Quiz is a quiz game for three or four players/teams. The questions are, obviously, based on films and television and there are four game modes-•Super Star- In this mode the game is played over three rounds of eight questions. The winner is the player with the most points and players each have two &apos;jokers&apos; to remove a wrong answer • Play or Pass- This is also played over three eight question rounds. Players have three lives and lose a life with each incorrect answer, they also have one joker per round which they can use to pass a tough question on to an opponent. If a player answers their question correctly they can select which opponent is asked the next question. • Shoot Out- A quick on the button round where questions are not addressed in turn to each player • Quiz Trilogy- This consists of one round from each of the above quiz modes. All quiz modes have three eight question rounds and the right answer is not given when a question is answered incorrectly. All questions are asked in &apos;teleprompter&apos; style, i.e. they are &apos;typed out&apos; on screen to the accompaniment of a clacking sound, and they are all multiple choice with four possible answers to choose from. The game has no &apos;high score&apos; table to record how many times a player wins nor does it have any movie/TV clips or soundbytes. This game is a little unusual in that players share controllers, players one and two share controller one with player one using the Cross,Square, Triangle, Circle buttons while player two answers the questions using the D-Pad buttons. Players three and four share controller two in a similar way. The game can be configured to set individual player handicaps. </story>

    <story>An alien called Cosmi got stuck on earth after his spaceship crashed on a satellite. The only way he can return home is by gaining enough money to repair his spaceship. Unfortunately for the humans, the only way Cosmi can obtain money is by causing panic amongst them. The player takes the role of Cosmi and can use several different weapons and gadgets to scare away the humans. You can launch a giant bowling ball, a cannon or a karaoke set to terrify the people with your awful singing. To obtain new weapons you have to scan the DNA of humans walking the streets, each having their own set of abilities. When you scare humans enough, they drop coins. Getting enough coins completes a level and ultimately, the game. Under the Skin brings you to different locations, including Raccoon City, the place where the Resident Evil games take place. In that level you battle the ultimate foe Nemesis, who this time is entirely cel-shaded, just like the rest of the game.</story>

    <story>Unlimited SaGa is a sequel to Square&apos;s famous series of non-linear RPGs. Like in the early Romancing Saga games, and in Saga Frontier, you assume the role of eight main characters (selectable at the beginning of the game). The story centers around Laura, a 30-year old widow and an ex-pirate, but you view the story and make it progress differently depending on which character you have chosen, and on the decisions you take throughout the game. Each character is represented by a different kind of flower. Unlimited SaGa feels and plays a lot like a classic board RPG. Everything - from disarming traps to hitting the enemy successfully in a battle - depends on the so-called REEL system. You have to stop a spinning slot machine at the right time, in order to perform an action successfully. It is similar to the classic dice system in pen-and-paper RPGs, and to the Judgment Ring system in Shadow Hearts. You can explore the world in a non-linear fashion, visit many optional areas and fight monsters at your will. Some puzzles have multiple solutions and can be solved by using a character&apos;s special skill. For example, a character with a Swim skill can cross a river and reach the next area of the game.</story>

    <story>Unreal Tournament is completely different to Unreal - it&apos;s now mainly based on multiplayer, like Quake 3. At the beginning, you have to play classic deathmatch rounds. After you have successfully won some of them, a new game mode becomes available, domination. In domination there are about 3 or 4 different areas scattered around the map to be controlled by your team. For a certain amount of seconds you control one area, a point is added to your score. The more areas you control, the faster your team&apos;s score rises. When you or the other team reaches a certain score, the game is over. The 3rd mode is called capture the flag, every team has a flag to defend and tries to capture the other team&apos;s flag to score a point. The 4th game mode is probably the most innovative one, it&apos;s called assault. These are real missions, like you have to attack an enemy base and destroy something in it. Again, there are two teams, the defenders and the attackers. You have to complete the mission in a certain time, like 5 or 10 minutes. If you were successful, your team has to defend this time and the other team attacks. But the attacking team now only has as much time as you needed to attack. All these modes are either playable in single or multiplayer mode. If playing alone, you have a large menu with orders you can give your bots. Also, all weapons were redesigned, and some new ones are added.</story>

    <story>Up is based on the animated movie of the same name. Carl Fredericksen always wanted to be an adventurer but he never got around to it. After his wife dies he gets depressed but finally decides to experience adventures after all. He gets accompanied by the scout Russel. Most levels are played with two characters with different abilities- Carl can use his walking aid as jumping help and crowbar while Russel balances on small ledges, catches insects or blinds enemies with his magnifying glass. Sometimes the dog Dug joins them who can pass through small holes and swim. The levels are basic platforming stages with many puzzles which need all these abilities to be solved. Of course this can be played in co-op too. Diversion is brought by a few flying levels with a biplane. There are numerous differences to the Xbox 360/Playstation 3/Wii version. There are more levels, additional mini games like a raft trip where the player has to dodge crocodiles, the story is told with actual cutscenes from the movie and there are more unlockable extras, e.g. cheats. The two player characters gain additional gadgets during the game which can be used to reach new areas in already beaten levels. The multiplayer modes are also different- this version lacks the simultaneous flying duels for four players but two variants for two players and six other mini games which can be player as tournament for four players.</story>

Your weapons can be upgraded by earning medals during your missions. You can earn these medals by scoring headshots, arresting enemies with your taser (as opposed to killing them), collecting gang masks, etc. You can even unlock extra missions and weapons by arresting gang leaders at the end of each level, so that the police can interrogate him and find out the gang&apos;s next move.</story>

    <story>A clandestine group has been organizing illegal street races in the USA for more than 50 years. What started as a fun event has grown into an annual contest for cash and glory. Only six are given a chance to prove their worth. USA Racer contains 11 tracks in different locations across the USA. Players can race in cities such as Los Angeles, New York or Washington DC or can take part in a race through the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone. Next to Time Trial and Single Race, the Tournament is the main event. It has been split up in three sections- Park Trial, City Trial and US Race. After completing a section, the next one is opened up. The tracks contain obstacles and jumps. Enemies will try to push other cars off the road, and the police also make an appearance. Scattered around the tracks are power-ups that repair the car, provide boost or cash. The money can be used to upgrade the car, repair it or buy boost prior to the race. After completing an entire tournament with a certain car, an alternate vehicle becomes available for that character. In the Windows version two-player duels are available over LAN or TCP/IP. Players can either go head-to-head or play a game of Cop vs. Racer.</story>

    <story>Valkyrie Profile 2- Silmeria is a prequel of the original PlayStation video game Valkyrie Profile and addresses some of unanswered questions in the previous game&apos;s storyline. Several hundred years before the story of the Valkyrie Lenneth, the young and rebellious Valkyrie Silmeria angers the god Odin and becomes imprisoned in the body of Alicia, the princess of Dipan. However, Silmeria manages to retain her consciousness and shares the body with Alicia, leading her father, King Barbarossa, to believe that she is possessed. As a result, he fakes her death and banishes her to a faraway land. When Odin learns of Silmeria&apos;s actions, he sends the third valkyrie, Hrist, to find Alicia and to bring Silmeria back to Asgard. In the meantime, Alicia and Silmeria seek the legendary Dragon Orb, an artifact that would allow them to be free from Odin forever. Although the game retains the side-scrolling aspect of the first Valkyrie Profile while traversing through dungeons or other locations, the second installment is rendered in three-dimensions throughout. The game takes advantage of this during the battle sequences as you must move and position your characters correctly to perform attacks. As in the previous game, Alicia/Silmeria will meet and recruit Einherjar, characters that will assist you in your quest.</story>

Enemies pop out from behind most objects and a reticule lights up around them to let you know they are armed and dangerous. You have to have quick reflexes as innocent people pop up which need to be protected. There are 6 levels in all, 3 from each game and these levels have multiple stages. With the three difficulty levels on offer, along with the modifications you can make in the options setup such as the number of continues and auto reload and taking off the enemy indicator, you can make the game as difficult or as easy as you wish. There are multiple paths on some levels so there is some incentive to replay the levels. There is a 2 player co-operative mode which can still be played with two light guns or you can use the Dual Shock pad. Training is also available. Even though this an old Sega Saturn game, it hasn&apos;t been improved much for the PS2 so expect a smoother gameplay of the older graphics.</story>

    <story>Virtua Pro Football is Sega&apos;s attempt to compete with the FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer series. It&apos;s more similar to those than the more arcade based games in the Virtua Striker series. Controls work as can be expected and include short and long passes, crosses, shots and different defence options. The game features a special one on one mode where offensive players can challenge and dribble past a defender. The camera then zooms in to a behind the shoulder perspective of the dribbler and the player can do different stick and button combinations to get past the defender. Some of the movement options that are possible are lunge, feint and nutmeg. The game features over 250 teams in twelve leagues (including three licensed ones; Dutch Eredivisie and Gouden Gids Divisie and Spanish LFP Primera Division). Competitions that the player can compete in are domestic leagues, club cups, international cup and custom leagues and cups. More unique is the player mode where the player gets to create and develop his own footballer. For each week the player can choose between practice, rest and going out. Practice is done through different mini games and by playing these the different skills will increase but so does the risk for injuries. Therefore rest is also needed at times. Going out means interacting with different people at various places and is needed to become more known to the supporters and the public. It&apos;s also possible to buy stuff, both football items and luxury items. Part of the player mode is also various events such as comments from the coach, meetings with the press and contract negotiations. The game also features a play book mode where the player can create his own tactics for set pieces. Teams created in Sega&apos;s other football game, Let&apos;s Make A Soccer Team! can be imported into Virtua Pro Football. </story>

    <story>Wakeboarding is part of Activision&apos;s line of Extreme Sports titles. A rider (using a board that&apos;s like a combination of a surf board, body board and skateboard) is pulled along the water by rope at high speeds by the boat up front, and must pull of tricks either by jumping of jumps or using the wake left by the boat itself (hence the sport&apos;s name). Unleashed takes this sport and turns it upside down, allowing you to fly down water ways through well known locations around the world, pulling stunts off buildings or cliff faces. Other objectives are included that have you completing tasks and busting tricks in a unique way. Multiplayer modes include one-on-one trick attack and horse, where both players compete against each other to pull off the best tricks. Co-operative mode has one player driving the boat while the other hangs on behind, with new challenges for the boat driver to complete as well as the rider.</story>

    <story>This game follows the Disney/Pixar movie of the same name. The player takes control of the main protagonist, Wall-E and his friend EVE. The gameplay of the game has Wall-E explore various levels through basic platforming ideas by picking up power-ups, defeating enemies by picking up objects and throwing them at enemies and solving puzzles to reach areas that are normally inaccessible to the player due to Wall-E&apos;s small stature and limitations. The player can also control EVE in a series of flying stages where the player uses EVE to fly into constricted areas and avoid falling objects and stationary obstacles in the way of the player. While the game does feature environments from the movie, it also has added environments and characters made exclusively for the game. This version does differ from its other version. This one does feature the same control setup, but has a different developer and has eighteen different worlds to play in while the other only has nine. Also, players can use music in this version to summon assistance during a level.</story>

    <story>War Chess is a basically a chess game with a unusual presentation. All the set pieces for the game are substituted for the character of the High Fantasy setting. Whites are pictured as joined armies of humans and elves, while blacks are mostly represented by the undead forces. The player has an ability to choose from 11 various location for the match to take place. Those include- Forest, Desert, Ice and Lava, Dragon Cave etc. All the environments and pieces are rendered in full 3D with a fully rotatable camera. For the single playing experience the game provides a difficulty slider to account for gamer&apos;s proficiency skill. Additionally War Chess offers a multiplayer mode for two players to battle each other as at one PC so as over the network. The game obviously takes it inspiration from the Battlechess series, however doesn&apos;t provide unique animations for each type of encounter on the chessboard. Each piece has a double set of animations- one for attacking, another for dying. Those do not differ depending on the type of the opposing piece.</story>

    <story>Warriors Orochi 2 is the sequel to Warriors Orochi, a game that combines characters from the Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors games into a new unique storyline. Wishing to test his strength, the Serpent King Orochi kidnapped the warriors of Dynasty and Samurai Warriors. After many battles he was eventually defeated, but the peace was to be short lived. While former officers from the Orochi army banded together to form their own armies, a mysterious group appeared to bring Orochi back from the netherworld. Picking up from where Warriors Orochi left off, this game pits the warriors of Wu, Shu, Wei and the Samurai against these foes and their armies. This game features similar gameplay to the other games in the Warriors series, like unlockable characters, upgradable weapons and multiple stages to play through. Also seeing a return is the team mate system from the previous Orochi game, which allows you to rotate between three different warriors. Choose these three warriors from over 90 playable characters, and use them to battle with as you strive to defeat the vast armies of your opponents. New features in this version include Dream Mode, which tells even more of Orochi&apos;s story then the last game, and new unlockable characters and weapons not seen before in the series.</story>

    <story>Based on the 1979 Paramount Pictures film of the same name and voiced by most of the original cast, The Warriors follows the career of a Coney Island street gang. Starting months before the events of the film, The Warriors expand and defend their Coney Island turf, while proving that they are heavy enough players to join The Riffs’ network. With a citywide rep, they can get invited to a major gang meeting where the future of New York street crime will be decided. The game follows the nine lead members of The Warriors (with flashback missions showing how they came to The Warriors)- leader Cleon, Swan, Ajax, Cowboy, Cochise, Snow, Fox, Rembrandt, and Vermin. During the game, the player will control each member, usually acting as a war chief and leading a squad of Warriors on a mission. Missions vary from simply wrecking another crew to completing a series of objectives while avoiding arrest or worse. During missions, players can mug pedestrians, steal car radios, commit smash and grabs, tag walls or bomb other gangs’ burners, and load up on flash. Between each story based mission, The Warriors return to their Coney Island hangout where they can train to improve their stats, go out on patrol, review their accomplishments, replay levels, or enter into a series of quick-play combat matches. The game plays like a squad-based brawler. Each Warrior has his own fighting style and much of the game environment can be weaponized. Fights are fast and often brutal, but stealth is also an option. Players can perform stealthy finishing moves and distract police or other gang members with thrown bottles. The game’s environments are fully 3D allowing Warriors to escape along the rooftops, hop over fences, or dash into shadowy areas.</story>

    <story>The Water Horse- Legend of the Deep is based on the movie by the same which in turn is based on a children novel by Dick King-Smith. It&apos;s a tale about a young boy, Angus MacMorrow, who on the shores of Loch Ness finds an egg which hatches into a water horse. The game starts shortly after that when Angus needs to get food to the newborn little creature. The story of the game is told between missions with clips from the movie. The player gets to control both Angus and Crusoe (the water horse). As mentioned before the game starts with Angus having to collect food for Angus. Angus is controlled from a top down perspective and has to sneak around the farm without being spotted by his mother or any of the soldiers that are patrolling the area. Each level has to be completed within a set time limit. Angus can use different objects to help him progress. Stones can be thrown to distract guards, four-leap can be used to avoid guards and wood planks and boxes can be used to cross streams and climb fences. The player also gets to control Crusoe during different stages of growth. Depending on which stage he is in the gameplay will also differ. In the baby stage he needs to eat to grow. The player controls Crusoe in a barrel full of water and needs to catch apples that are dropped into the barrel before they sink. There&apos;s both good and rotten apples and it&apos;s important to only eat the good ones. In the toddler stage Crusoe needs to learn how to swim in a bath tub. This is done with a quick time event where the player has to press the right keys at the right time as they appear on the screen. In the teenager stage Crusoe needs to swim around a pond to find fish that he can eat. The more fish he eats the faster he swims, while the reeds and lily pads in the pond makes him slow down. In the adult stage the player controls a full grown Crusoe in the loch. Here Crusoe has to navigate through the loch while avoiding the different dangers of the loch such as mines, Victoria gun shells and photographer boats. At the same time Crusoe must find food and surface now and then to catch his breath. Throughout the levels of the game the player will come across mosaic pieces that can be collected. In total there is 100 pieces and they can used to unlock clips from the movie. In addition to the story mode the player can also play through individual levels at any time, as long as these are unlocked in the story mode.</story>

As the main character and hero of the story, the player must bring resolution to this conflict, and peace to the town, in whatever Way he deems best. There is a realistic day and night cycle and various strategical elements. You can talk to various characters, accept tasks and shop for new items.

    <story>After the success of Katamari Damacy, the King of all Cosmos and his son, the Prince, have gained quite a bit of fame. To keep all of the fans happy, the Prince is once again sent to Earth to roll stuff up with a katamari (a clump of stuff); this time he&apos;s taking requests from the fans as to what should be rolled up! The gameplay is the same as in Katamari Damacy; using both of the analog sticks you can push the katamari around. When the katamari runs over an object that is small enough, it will stick causing the katamari to grow in size. As the katamari grows, you&apos;ll be able to roll up increasingly larger objects. There are a variety of different objectives that need to be completed; some tasks will have you rolling up as much as you can within a time limit, others may have you rolling up a fixed number of objects as fast as can, and sometimes certain objects need to be avoided. Most of the missions take place in a large settings- such as a series of rooms, an open park and even complete cities. Special settings require the prince to roll up clouds to bring back the sun, or to collect lights so a young man can study. As the katamari rolls around, it can pick up almost anything; umbrellas, desks, erasers, pencils, batteries, plants, beach balls, tea kettles, fences, assorted animals, people, buildings, trees, mountains, cars, and many other objects. Between levels there are short-cut scenes providing some back story on the Prince and the King of all Cosmos. All missions start from the meadow, a central location where animals and people call for help. The prince can choose to accept the mission or look for something else. Upon completion, the prince returns to the king and the katamari is sent into space as a planet, or as stardust when there already is a better or larger planet available. To the end the game, the prince is transported to the cosmos to roll up all the planets and finally roll up the sun. In the meadow, players can view presents, rankings, collections, and change general options or save/restore a game. The game features all new unusual songs as well as a new two-player mode. The visuals are very bright, with unusual characters and conversations.</story>

    <story>Known to many road users, the infamous White Van Man is the workman that drives his light commercial vehicle through traffic in a particularly aggressive and infuriating manner. Frivolous honking and cutting off other road users are his trademark. In White Van Racer, players are given the chance to turn the tables on this modern-day phenomenon, and become a White Van Man of their own. Selectable vans range from nondescript models to ice cream trucks, mobile burger shops, or business vehicles for painters and window cleaners. While there is no civilian traffic on the roads, drivers compete against up to 4 other computer-controlled vans in a dash for the finish line. There is a total of 12 linear stages, set in 2 scenarios and consisting of variations (direction, time of day) on 4 basic road sections. True to the White Van Man disposition, pushing and shoving competitors is a necessary tactic for the successful driver. Apart from quick race and time trial modes, three championships allow players to unlock more stages and vans.</story>

    <story>In ancient times, a war was fought against demons on a world named Filgara. The planet bears the scars of this encounter as much of the world is barren and the ocean has turned to sand. For different reasons, four characters set out to become drifters and make their own path over the plains. Virginia Maxwell chose this trip on a steam train because she was bored by the monotonous life in a sleepy village and wanted to explore the world. Treasure-hunter Jet Enduro thinks the train will bring him to a place where a flower with magic powers can be found. Gallows Caradine is a shaman of his tribe and is the guardian of a sacred artifact. Clive Winslet is a cynical archaeologist and part-time bounty hunter. A fateful encounter aboard a train will bring these four together and mix them up in the doings of a mysterious organization of scientists. This Council of Seven once was formed to renew the life force of Filgara, but now seems to be harnessing it for their own means. This third installment of the Wild Arms series continues the tradition of two previous games, adding a stronger emphasis on the (fantasy) Wild West atmosphere. Characters have the ability to attack using ARMS (projectile weapons), use special abilities, use items or cast Arcana (magic). From the beginning of the game, each of the four characters has an introductory chapter before becoming a party and traveling together. The battles are random, with a FP gauge which fills while attacking and defending, and usage of Arms and magic which require FP, similar to the second game of the series. Later on, special vehicles feature their own type of battle system. Other similarities to previous Wild arms games include the search system (towns and dungeons are not indicated on the map until you discover them), the ability to cancel a random battle and special abilities used outside of battles to solve puzzles. An interesting innovation is a dialogue based on key words, similar to a system commonly used in adventure games, which allows a more flexible use of dialogue options.</story>

    <story>You play as a young teenager named Jude Maverick. You live in a quiet village that floats high above the ground, unaware of the world that lies beneath it. But one day, your world is shattered to pieces, and you descend onto the earth to face the terrible reality- the world of Filgaia was devastated by wars. A few settlements amidst rusty tanks is all that is left of civilization. The democratically elected government has some plans for improving the conditions of the world, but as you meet a young girl whom they used as a tool for their purpose, you realize you must find a better plan to save her, and the world, from complete destruction. The fourth installment of Wild Arms series abandons its traditional Wild West theme and is set in a post-apocalyptic world. The gameplay system introduces hex-based battles. Battle screens are divided into seven hexes, each one of which can hold several party members or foes. You navigate your characters on the battle field, trying to force the enemy into an uncomfortable position. There is also a variety of skills you can learn and apply in battles to get benefits. As in previous Wild Arms games, the dungeons contain many environmental puzzles to solve.</story>

Dean is a boy who dreams of becoming a hunter of golems, the huge, ancient machines that were once built to serve mankind. Along with his childhood friend Rebecca Streisand, and Avril Vent Fleur, a mysterious girl who falls from the sky, Dean sets out on an adventure to chase his dream of becoming a golem hunter and to help Avril recover her memories. Wild Arms 5 is a third-person role-playing game where the player explores the world and fights battles in turn-based combat sequences with up to 3 characters in your party. The playing field during combat is split in seven hexagonal sections, of which some have special properties. Players can use guardian beasts, combination arts (team work), chain attacks, original attacks and others. Just like the previous game, these are based on a force meter, which increases when characters attack or are being attacked. In the exploration mode, Dean and his party can use vehicles or run around, and during dungeon exploration there are two modes- Action (jumps, slides, interaction) and Shooting (through ARMs, Dean can choose from various cartridges to interact with the environment, destroying or manipulating it).</story>

He is expelled from his home for using this power to defeat a monster. Jack is a careless treasure hunter who roams caves and ruins with his trusty friend, the blue rodent Hanpan. Cecilia is a young princess who was sent to a magician school to study the lore of magic. She has the ability to communicate with ancient powerful beings called the Guardians. The three heroes meet each other and embark on a journey to save the world of Filgaia from a grave danger. Wild Arms Alter Code- F is a remake of the original Wild Arms for Playstation. The basic gameplay premise remained the same- you participate in random turn-based battles, using attacks, special magic unique to each character, and other abilities (such as summoning Guardians). In dungeons there are many physical and environmental puzzles to solve. The remake features fully 3D graphics, changes and more detail in the design of many locations, and a new party to control. In the original, only Rudy, Jack, and Cecilia were available as playable characters. In the remake, several other characters can be taken into your party and even switched during the same battle.</story>

Up to four players, in single kayaks or controlling a raft together, can play simultaneously to go down rivers, conquer rapids and drop off cliffs. The player especially needs to pay attention to the steering, which is controlled through the analogue sticks, one for each of the character&apos;s arms, to avoid a variety of obstacles. This is done by constantly moving them in a circular motion. Next to the main game modes, there is also a training to explore the course and get used to the handling.

During the first part each mission, a number of Assist points will happen where the player must assist the second character -- their performance here affects the playthrough of the second part of the mission, and doing well will reward you with cover fire or health bonuses later.

Some new clubs were brought to their proper names (such as Manchester United instead of Man Red), while others have lose it (such as Chelsea which is now once again London FC). However, despite the names, players are correct as Chelsea does have Ballack and Schevchenko, Real Madrid now has Van Nistelrooy which was in Manchester United and so on. Controls are the same, but moves and strategies have changed, as they tend to do from game to game. Fouls are not as easygoing as in previous game, but players turning is now too slow unless you know how to do it properly. Moves are much more realistic and goal keepers don&apos;t catch every ball with an ease, even easy one can sometimes slip by. That said, it all makes one step closer to reality, while it loses the reality factor on some other sides. Cameras are typical broadcast, tower, and bird-perspective, and cups, league and master league are still included. The Xbox 360 version is the only one to have hi-definition graphics and more animations, as the PC version is a conversion of the PS2 engine. The 360 version lacks a few features however, such as co-operative play, the PES shop, a replay save feature and some minor settings such as the ability to create players, rename leagues, edit kits, team names, boots and player appearances, and you cannot swap kit combinations.</story>

While not as complex as the specialized games developed by the German company (there&apos;s no waxing the skis, for instance), the game features a solid physics engine, which provides more realism than some of the most arcadish approaches to the genre. Gameplay varies by event, with the player being in full control of the athlete in most events like alpine skiing and half-pipe (which plays like most radical sports games featuring tricks and flicks instead of being on-rails), while other modes feature an higher focus on rhythm, like speed skating and figure skating. Curling plays like most games previously featuring the event, but there are two modes- simulation plays like the actual sport, where a team scores a point for each stone closer to the middle than the opponents&apos; closest, while game awards points for each of the stones inside the target. The game features three modes- Competition, where the player can participate in 5, 9 or all 16 events (or customize them), Campaign, where the player has to complete a number of quick goals to unlock additional tracks and features from previous games, while Career requires the player to compete in 15 levels with an increasing number of events to do the same. Single Events allow the player to train on any event.</story>

    <story>WipEout Pulse is the second game in the WipEout series to be released on the PSP. Just like the other titles in the series, it is a futuristic racing games where players control a hovercraft-like vehicle that hovers above the ground and can reach very high speeds. The game is set in 2207 where players take part in the FX400 Anti-Gravity Racing League with courses all over the world. The vehicles are divided over different teams (twelve including downloads), each with their own characteristics based on handling, speed, acceleration and more. While racing, moving over pads provides boosts or both offensive and defensive power-ups such as shields, rockets, a wall of fire, autopilot, a gun or a turbo boost. Instead of using weapons, they can now also be absorbed to restore the energy levels. A single button is used to accelerate, with regular steering and also air brakes for sharp corners. The visuals are very fast and the soundtrack consists of mostly electronic tracks, a hallmark of the series. The base game consists of twelve tracks, but these can be driven in both directions (designated by black or white in the title name). New to the track design are waterfall-like drops, loops and corkscrews. At certain section the vehicle is glued to the track to pass these. Entirely new to the series is the revamped progression system. As usual, new tracks and faster models need to be unlocked by winning races, but instead of a linear model these are now grouped as hexagon-clustered grids with different modes of play. When available, players can choose any of the sections to participate in a time trial, single race, head-to-head, eliminator games (returning from Wipeout 3) and Zone games (introduced in WipEout Fusion) where the vehicle constantly accelerates and transforms into faster models until all health is depleted. A certain amount of races need to be won to access a new grid, but using this system some difficult races can be avoided or ignored. In all races the vehicles are destroyed when all energy is depleted. Based on the performance a bronze, silver or gold medal is awarded and there are three difficulty settings. Using the vehicle of a certain team regularly is awarded with a loyalty system. The game supports game sharing and multiplayer modes using both Ad Hoc and Infrastructure as access. Up to 30 mp3 files can be loaded on a memory stick to use as the in-game soundtrack, there is photo mode to take screenshots during replays and on the game&apos;s official website players can design their own car skins using a flash client to use in the game. As with the previous games, there are many expansion packs that introduce new teams and tracks.</story>

    <story>This edition of Codemasters official licensed Snooker game includes over 30 snooker-champions and 10 official snooker tournaments. The LG Tour is the campaign of the game in which you can make your own player and play against the best of the world to win the championship. To make it easy for beginners and as realistic as possible for those who want it, you can change how much help the program gives you while you play (i.e. a aim-meter). But the developers also included a big tutorial which teaches you everything from the rules to the right angle for a shot. It&apos;s even possible to make a free game where you get feedback for every shot you make. Besides the campaign you can also play 8-Ball &amp; US-9-Ball Pool, the famous trick-snooker, 5 bonus game-modes (i.e. Against the clock - play a frame with the clock ticking and only a limited amount of time for each shot) and the Classic Match mode. The Classic Match mode is the most interesting because you can play famous games from the whole history of Snooker like the really big championship final from 1985 Steve Davis vs. Dennis Taylor which had 18,5 million viewers in Great Britain alone. And if you get bored with the challenging AI, you can also play over LAN or online against up to 16 players. If you&apos;re good enough your name will even appear in the hall of fame on the official website.</story>

    <story>World of Outlaws- Sprint Cars 2002 is a game that focuses on the niche motorsport of sprint car racing. While many people haven&apos;t even heard of the sport, most would recognize the distinct design of the speedy vehicles, with their partially exposed frame and trademark roof wing. The idea is simple, and anyone who is somewhat familiar with NASCAR--or any form of automotive racing, for that matter--ought to be able to pick it up with a little practice. The game is for the most part a simulation of real-life racing, with a strong career mode and a number of customization options. There are also elements to it that make it accessible to those who are looking to try something new, but overall, this is a game that is aimed directly at sprint car racing fans. As such, the developmental focus was clearly on the gameplay, seemingly at the expense of the audio and visual aspects of the game.</story>

    <story>WRC World Rally Championship is a rally game that features licensed FIA cars, tracks, and drivers of the 2001 racing season. While the game has full single and multiplayer options, most of the play centers around a detailed career mode where an entire racing season can be experienced. To start, the game allows the selection of a professional rally car (from a set of 7) and a driver. Selecting a driver also includes the co-driver/navigator that assists during the actual races. Playing an actual season involves completing 14 events in the game&apos;s 80+ tracks. Each track matches its real world counterpart and rendered in accurate terrain and weather detail - asphalt to dirt roads to rocky trails. In addition to the normal driving controls and feedback common to most racing games, the game adds a simple car damage system that not only affects the visual appearance (muddied paint, busted lights) of the vehicles but also the gameplay. A particularly brutal race for instance, might leave the car listing and handling poorly towards the end of the event. Two players can compete in a time-based competition.</story>

    <story>World Soccer Winning Eleven 9 pushes the franchise one level up towards realism by expanding and improving character moves and control. Now, the match feels more real to the actual play as players make mistakes more often and passes don&apos;t go too well if the player is on the wrong foot, or makes a bad turn. The new gameplay may require slight adjustment for players to switch from older versions to this one. The standard modes are here, match mode (with newly added memorial match), various leagues, and cups. Some more teams now have their proper names (like Arsenal and Chelsea), and are having up to date players in the teams. Also, new weather condition has been added, snow.</story>

    <story>World Super Police is a single player police pursuit game. Gameplay here is virtually identical to games like Outrun, a series of games that started life on the DOS and Amiga platforms in the mid eighties. The story behind the game is that normal police cars cannot catch criminals in really fast cars so, in order to combat increasing car crime, the World Super Police (WSP) have been formed. There are two strands to this game, one based around the Blue Wing group (WSP Japan) and the other around Red Hawks (WSP USA). In each strand there is a story but the missions are basically the same, the player&apos;s car sits firmly in the centre of the screen at the bottom and the scenery rushes by. On the left of the screen is a vertical bar which gives a &apos;radar&apos; view the road ahead The object is to keep the car on the road, travel as fast as possible avoiding other traffic, and take-out the bad guy with whatever weapons the player equipped their car(s) with. This involves racing for a minute or so until the target(s) show up on the radar at which point the felonious fiend must be stopped before they reach the border. Some missions are solo and unarmed, while in others the player is accompanied by fellow WSP in super cars and they can switch between offensive and defensive formations. The game&apos;s main menu also features a Training option which, unusually, is greyed out at the start of the game and can only be accessed once the player has completed one or more missions in either story. The menu also has a Royal Scramble option in which the player can replay old missions, naturally this too can only be accessed once the player has completed one or more missions</story>

About all the features of its original 2D ancestors are also present, including random wind and a fully destructible landscape. Not all the weapons that were previously available have made the cut into the 3 dimensional realm, however Worms 3D comes too with a selective set of new weaponry such as the Lottery Strike or the Gas Grenade which should allow you to find a few dozen of new ways to kill your fellow worms online.</story>

The main goal of the game is still the same, to burst the bubbles, however this time instead of featuring little and cute dinosaurs, Worms Blast introduces battle-hardened worms or explosive sheep angry for points, battling up on boats. Fortunately, Worms Blast is not just a mere copycat of Puzzle Bobble with cell-shaded graphics. Team 17 have made numerous changes to the gameplay, which make playing the game quite a different experience. Along others, these change include the ability to actually move your character or to shoot on the other player, different kinds of weapons and a load of varied gameplay modes. The main change to the game is probably the fact that you&apos;re no longer firing bubbles, but missiles that color them on impact.</story>

    <story>Worms Forts is a turn-based strategy game where 2 – 4 people battle it out with a team of 4 worms with the help of weapons and forts. Each player takes timed turns bombing, shooting, causing natural and unnatural disasters, punching and blowing up the other opponent’s worms. Each worm has a set amount of health and once that health is depleted or the worm drowns that worm is dead. New to the Worms series is the ability to construct buildings to aid in the fight. Build hospitals to resurrect dead worms, science labs to increase your firepower, strongholds to base your operations in and protect your worms, towers, keeps, castles and citadels to deploy weapons from there tops and weapon factories to produce multiple weapons around it at the start of each turn you take. Along with these typical building you can create Wonders in which your opponent has two turns to knock it down and if they don’t succeed you win. If they in turn build there own you must destroy it to win the game. Along with the typical Worms series weapons like the mini gun, bazooka, rocket launcher, earthquake and homing pigeon (a homing missile in the form of a pigeon) you will also have weapons to destroy buildings like the trebuchet, fridge launcher, nuclear strike and the Trojan Donkey in which you get to place a Trojan Donkey where you like where it remains until it explodes, how long it takes to explode is not known. Some weapons like the Old Women and Rhino can be steered to your desired location upon which they explode on contact or exploded early by pressing a button. Throughout the game different crates will fall from the sky or teleport onto the playing field. There are four different types of crates- weapon crates (more powerful weapons), health crates (increase the health of a wounded or sick worm), utility crates (carrying instant utilities – spy (see contents of all crates on the field), double time (doubling the time for your turn) and double damage (for one turn inflict double the damage) and collectible utilities like freeze (freeze your worms or building to protect them from damage for one turn), parachute (so your worm can safely jump from heights), jet pack (to reach distant locations and heights) and repair (to fix damaged buildings)). Single play allows for a quick game, tutorial, campaign, the trials (death match against the CPU) and the viewing gallery (view movies you have unlocked in the game by winning matches, how much of the game you’ve completed, check out the credits and look through the Fortapedia (a list of buildings available in the game and there descriptions)). As with the other Worms games in multiplayer you have a plethora of options to choose from to set up a match against other people including allowing the CPU to play. Choose schemes (selection of pre-set weapons and game options), landscapes (the type of playing field – Roman, Egyptian, Samurai and Old World), Fortpot (a slot machine that randomly selects three game options from the many available), game settings (wins required, turn time, etc.), worm health and sudden death settings.</story>

    <story>An updated port of the original Xbox version of Wreckless- The Yakuza Missions, adding several new features. Missions are now ranked based on how quickly they are completed, and fast times reward medals. By completing a bonus objective on hard mode, such as destroying traffic, a bonus mission will be unlocked. Earning a gold medal in a bonus mission will further unlock a cheat code, like unlimited time or low gravity. A free mode is available now too, allowing the player to drive through the city without worrying about a time limit. Finally two new features have been added to the cars- an adrenaline feature that slows down time, and a limited supply of short-range missiles. A new multiplayer mode allows two players to play on a single screen, with the camera following the trailing player. Different modes are available, such as a mode where the trailing car attempts to ram the leading car, or a normal racing mode.</story>

    <story>WWE All Stars can be seen as a successor to WWF Wrestlemania- The Arcade Game. Unlike the simulation-based WWE SmackDown vs. Raw games, it offers a more arcade-oriented gameplay, featuring elements of fighting games, with over-the-top moves and unrealistic animation. Similarly to versus fighters, the wrestling in the game is predominantly combo-based. The wrestler&apos;s signature moves are exaggerated, including nearly supernatural elements such as diving high into the air or slow motion moves. The game features popular WWE wrestlers from its time, such as Triple H, The Undertaker, Rey Mysterio, Big Show and John Cena, as well as WWF wrestlers from the past- Hulk Hogan, Bret Hart, The Ultimate Warrior, Jake the Snake and the Macho Man Randy Savage. The game includes a Path Of Champions mode, where players can choose a WWE Legend or Superstar to either become the WWE Champion, the World Heavyweight Champion, or the WWE Tag Team Champions.</story>

    <story>The 2008 edition in the Smackdown vs Raw series holds new features to the WWE game franchise. This is the first in the series to include the extremists of ECW, including The Sandman, Marcus Cor Von and CM Punk. The game also features a brand new struggle submission system, new weapon choices including guitars, and eight superstar fighting styles, including Showman, Powerhouse, High-Flyer and more. Each player can now choose a primary and a secondary fighting style. It continues the legend trend and brand new arenas, such as Wrestlemania 23, Unforgiven and Summerslam as well as the classic superstars like Undertaker, Shawn Michaels and Ric Flair. The roster largely depends on the platform and some versions include wrestlers not available in the other ones. The season and general manager modes of the previous games have been merged into the WWE 24/7 mode (PlayStation, Xbox 360), allowing to create a new superstar, play as an existing one or choose to manage someone. In the Wii version this is called Main Event mode and it does not contain an option to manage wrestlers. There is also a new Tournament mode with various challenges. Some of the features match types are Iron Man, Battle Royal, Hell in a Cell, Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, Hardcore, Ladder, Elimination Chamber and Royal Rumble. In the Wii version five match types are available- Single (One on One), Tag Team (Two on Two), K.O. Match, Triple Threat and Hardcore. It does not have the WWE Shop and a smaller move list, but includes Mii integration (menu screens and in-game HUD) as well as motion-sensing attacks based on the controls. The Xbox 360 versions allows players to use custom music during entrances while the PS3 version offers a first-person view during those sequences. Both are the only ones to offer online multiplayer.</story>

This game features vast improvements on the tag team action, including all new Hot-Tag, tag team finishers and new actions to help in the match. As with the previous game the roster includes over 60 superstars from Smackdown, Raw and ECW. To keep the roster up-to-date, the game includes a roster editor allowing players to change the rosters superstars are on and change their alignment between face and heel. However, this is the first game in the Smackdown series since Here Comes the Pain not to feature any legends. Another new feature is Create-a-Finisher, which allows players to create their own unique finishing move out of over 500 different animations. These can also be shared online during online matches. This game includes two different story modes, i.e. Road to Wrestlemania and Career mode. Road to Wrestlemania mode allows you to play 6 unique stories involving Triple H, CM Punk, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, John Cena and a co-op storyline featuring Batista and Rey Mysterio. Career mode is the replacement of GM Mode from previous games. This allows you to make a career for superstars and upgrade your created wrestlers. Other features include the Highlight Reel, letting you create videos from your matches, the brand new Inferno Match, new positions in the backstage brawl and the new gauntlet match.</story>

A custom character can still be created with the Create-A-Superstar tool, now expanded to include 3D apparel and decorations. The Create-A-Finisher feature now has aerial techniques, with jumping trajectory and speed customization. Some modifications were made to the gameplay, with more grapple moves and a new training mode for beginners. Instead of using the previous two-button system, reversals are now performed based on timing, where the player has to press the correct button when the icon appears.

    <story>WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 is a professional wrestling video game that is based on the two brands of WWE, Raw and SmackDown. One of the main changes in the game is the incorporation of a new physics system that allows objects to be used more realistically, such as objects involved in the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. Tables now break differently depending on the impact placed upon them. Inside and outside the ring, ladders can now be rested onto the ring ropes and be broken in half. For the first time since the original WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw game, chairs can be thrown at your opponents. The Hell in a Cell match is revamped with expanded cell walls, weapons underneath the ring, steel steps near the poles, and the cell door is removed. In addition, the game adds new ways to escape the steel cage. The game&apos;s new WWE Universe mode replaces the career mode from previous games. The mode builds storylines, and integrates cut scenes and rivalries between wrestlers based on the matches that are wrestled. These cut scenes appear randomly before, during, and after the match. Road to WrestleMania mode has been modified to include new features such as backstage roaming, mini-quests, and further interaction with other Superstars. Playable storylines involve Rey Mysterio, John Cena, Christian, and Chris Jericho. Along with that is the new storyline in which players choose Kofi Kingston, John Morrison, Dolph Ziggler, R-Truth, or a created superstar in a quest to end The Undertaker&apos;s undefeated WrestleMania streak.</story>

Another new addition is General Manager Mode, where you take the role of GM and try to book your weekly show.

Each episode has two acts, and takes players from secret facilities, to FBI headquarters, to a remote location in Siberia in search of the truth. Gameplay is similar to the Resident Evil series. A fixed camera tracks the player and changes angles at specified points in the room. Control is similar, and players lock on to enemies to fire, and cannot move while shooting. Each episode can be played as either Mulder or Scully, with a few different locations and challenges (such as autopsies and puzzles for Scully) for each side of the story. Bonus content includes brief videos of the dialogue recordings and concept art for the game.</story>

Rescued by the X-Men, Alison is taken to Professor Charles Xavier&apos;s School for the Gifted where she begins her quest to learn control over her lava-based powers. X-Men- Legends is a role-playing game set in the Marvel Universe. Offering single and multiplayer support, Legends tells the broad story of the war between mutants and humankind and the conflict between the X-Men and The Brotherhood, against the personal story of Alison and the role she plays. Controlling a party of four X-Men, picked from a roster that grows to 15 mutants, players take on armed guards, evil mutants, and killer Sentinels. Mutant powers grow stronger as the X-Men level up, but so do the challenges- securing an aircraft carrier, preventing a nuclear power plant meltdown and more.</story>

    <story>Year 20XX. Lake Turkana, Kenya. A group of scientists discover a mysterious monolith called Zohar. Year 4767 T.C. - Transcend Christ, or 7277 A.D., according to the old year-counting system. Zohar is no longer a mystery. All space ships are Zohar-powered. Humanity left the planet Earth (which is now called Lost Jerusalem) long ago, and founded a galactic empire on 30000 planets. However, a hostile alien race called Gnosis is hunting after Zohar. Giant bi-pedal robots called Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems (pronounced eggs) do not seem to be enough to stop the Gnosis. The Vector Corporation decides to develop an android called KOS-MOS to be the ultimate weapon against the Gnosis. Shion Uzuki is the 22-year-old engineer leading this project. Xenosaga is not part of the same universe as the Square game Xenogears, although it is based on the back-story of that game as written in Xenogears Perfect Works. The events of Xenosaga are roughly analogous to the very first events in the history of Xenogears, although as the series progressed events would diverge more and more from the timeline of Xenogears. Der Wille zur Macht is one of the central aspects of Friedrich Nietzsche&apos;s philosophy, meaning The will to power. The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated. Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the next few ally and enemy turns will be shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character&apos;s boost gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts. Each character has a unique tree of Ether spells they can learn by spending Ether points earned in battle, with lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS.</story>

    <story>This is a direct sequel to the first episode of the science-fiction RPG Xenosaga series. The story takes place thousands of years in the future, when mankind has long left the Earth, which is now called Lost Jerusalem, and founded a star empire. The main threat humanity has to face is the appearance of a super-powerful alien race called the Gnosis. The story picks up just after the concluding events of the first episode. Shion Uzuki, the young engineer who designed the powerful android KOS-MOS, arrives with her friends at the planet Second Miltia. They aim to learn more about the heritage of the late genius scientist Joachim Mizrahi, and to stop the schemes of the mysterious villains Albedo and Margulis. Jin Uzuki, Shion&apos;s brother, who was only mentioned in the first game, becomes an important character in the second episode. We also learn more about the origin of the boy chaos, and about the race of Realians, artificial humans created by Mizrahi. The gameplay in general and the battle system in particular are quite similar to that of the first game. All enemies are visible on screen, and field objects can be destroyed in order to attract the attention of the enemy or to create a zone that will weaken it. The turn-based combat again features triangle and square attacks, which now inflict different damage on enemies of different height. Another addition is the ability to wait two or three turns in a battle, accumulating energy for a stronger attack. The AGWS (giant robots) battles are still present, but you can&apos;t switch to AGWS at any point, like it was possible in the first game. Another game aspect removed from the first game is money, as well as shops, weapons, and armor of any kind. The only items in the game are healing items or keys that unlock the ability to learn high level skills. The second episode continues to be heavy on story development, and also has a significant amount of non-interactive cut scenes. Character graphics underwent the biggest change. The characters look now more realistic and less deformed or animé-like.</story>

She leaves her post and tries to solve the mystery on her own. Meanwhile, the KOS-MOS project is halted, and a mysterious new android, T-elos, emerges to replace it. Shion and her friends are about to fight the ultimate battle that will determine the destiny of mankind... The third episode retains the combat basics of the two previous games. Once again, there are two kinds of combat, in human form and piloting giant robots. The usage of ether attacks, boost gauge, and other typical Xenosaga gameplay elements are also present in this game. Robot combat is handled somewhat differently, the giant gears having a wider variety of attacks at their disposal. Both your and the enemy&apos;s parties have now a special bar that will render them immobile when filled. Exploiting this feature is yet another strategic addition to the combat. There is an in-game database listing all events, people, items, monsters and locations. Next to the main storyline, there are 60 puzzle mini-games. The game includes an editor to create these custom puzzles and share them with friends.</story>

    <story>Xiaolin Showdown is a game based on the animated series of the same name from Warner. It is a fighting game where you play as the four main characters of the show (Kimiko, Omi, Raimundo and Clay). Even if you play alone (the game supports 4 simultaneous players in story mode), the other 3 are present, controlled by the computer. You can also unlock 2 additional characters- Jack Spicer and Chase Young. The players must defeat waves of enemy robots to collect Shen Gong Wu artifacts to increase their power and defeat series of enemies, until they are able to face Mala Mala Jong and put an end on the plans of the evil boy genius, Jack Spicer. Each Shen Gong Wu provides a new power, like locking nearby characters or punching the ground for area damage. Additional Shen Gong Wu can be bought using coins collected during the game. The gameplay is inspired by party fighting games, like Power Stone and Super Smash Bros. You can chain combos with button combinations, jump and give flying kicks. Between the game levels, there are showdowns, where the characters have to bet a Shen Gong Wu. The one that wins the challenge chooses a Shen Gong Wu from the player who lost. You can also only play the showdowns, instead the full story mode.</story>

There are several different types of attacks- a regular shot, which can be upgraded five times by power-ups dropped by enemy ships; a side attack is a risky manoeuvre that involves pushing the control stick quickly left and right to destroy enemies to the left or right of the player&apos;s ship. This will also increase the score multiplier. The ship&apos;s exhaust can also be put to use by damaging enemies that come up from behind. The final weapon is the barrier, which creates a protective ring around the player, destroying all enemies that touch it. The game also features a difficulty setting adjusted dynamically by the score - the higher the player scores, the more difficult the game gets. XII Stag also has checkpoints in each level, which compare the current player&apos;s score to the high score at this point in the game.</story>

    <story>XIII is a cel-shaded first-person shooter based on the popular Belgian cult comic created by Jean Van Hamme and illustrated by William Vance. The game is loosely based on the first five comics. The main theme of the game is based on Robert Ludlum&apos;s book &apos;The Bourne Identity&apos; and features a man who is suffering from amnesia and quite possibly involved in the recent assassination of the President of the United States. You must be damn important, because everyone is trying to kill you. As you progress, you learn more about your secret agent past and your curious name, XIII. You unravel clues behind a conspiracy of epic proportions in an environment that breathes a comic book ambiance. Footsteps and shots are visualized in text and actions such as head shots are shown in a series of still images. Aside from that, XIII has all the typical FPS elements- both stealth and action, more than 15 weapons (shotguns, crossbows, rifles, ...), interaction with environmental objects and a whole load of baddies in levels all over the world. During the game, you can learn a number of skills such as silent walking, lockpicking and dual weapons handling.</story>

    <story>Xyanide Resurrection is a sequel to the Xbox game Xyanide. It takes place after the happenings of the first game. The evil space witch Aguira is still alive after having escaped her death sentence. It&apos;s once again up to the executioner Drake to find her and bring her to justice. Aguira has used the xyanide to create a strange world that Drake has to travel through and battle countless of enemies. Xyanide Resurrection is a third person shoot &apos;em up, similar to a rail shooter. The player controls a spaceship travelling through space. Forward motion is automatic but the player can move the ship up and down and left and right to avoid the fire of the incoming enemies. The player can also rotate the view as the enemies attack from all angles. As enemies are destroyed they drop pieces of xyanide that the player can collect. Xyanide restores health but it can also be used to purchase upgrades and new weapons in the store between levels. When starting out the ship is equipped with a simple fusion gun that shoots single shots and bombs when bigger explosions are needed. Three extra weapons can be bought- shotgun, laser and rockets. It is also possible to buy a magnet to easier collect xyanide and a shield that can take some damage. The game&apos;s story mode consists of five levels that have to be completed sequentially. By playing the story mode, levels are unlocked for the quick play mode where the player can perfect his score. A digital comic and artwork can also be unlocked. There is also a score attack mode where the player has to get as many points as possible before time runs out. The multiplayer mode is for two players that compete in getting the highest score by collecting pickups. </story>

The main character, Kazuma Kiryu, is a feared Yakuza enforcer who is embroiled in a mystery that involves his closest friends and $10 billion yen missing from the Yakuza clan&apos;s main bank. The core of the game is hand-to-hand fighting, where the player can use an enormous variety of weapons and items against his enemies. The game features a character upgrade system, where experience points will give Kazuma more hit points, unlock new moves, increase the heat gauge (special power meter), or unlock new heat moves, which give the player the most powerful and nasty looking attacks in the game. The adventure elements contain plenty of collection quests and dating mini-games, authentically reproducing the nightlife found in modern-day Tokyo.</story>

    <story>One year has passed since Kazuma Kiryu, yakuza with the heart of gold, defeated his biggest adversary in the previous game. Despite this victory, Kiryu has lost more than he had ever imagined. But events from the past continue to haunt him. A man he had admired so much, who was like a father to him, has revealed a terrible secret before he died. It&apos;s time for Kiryu to solve the mystery once and for all. Caught in the eternal fight between Kantou and Kansai, the Eastern and the Western mafia groups of Japan, he soon realizes that there are other powers on the stage, including a mysterious Korean organization that seems to be connected somehow to his past... The sequel to Yakuza continues the story from the previous game, featuring many recurrent characters. The main gameplay idea also remains the same - adventure-like exploration, hand-to-hand fighting, and slight role-playing elements, similar to the kind of gameplay that was introduced in Shenmue games. The sequel features some technical improvements, such as the ability to rotate the camera during the fights. It also contains more side-missions and mini-games, ranging from playing pool and mahjong to running a club and dating girls.</story>

    <story>This 3D board game consists of a series of duels, which are played with cards. The game has been split up in a Campaign Mode, in which you take on all levels of the Monster Coliseum on your own, a Free Battle Mode where you play skirmish matches against enemies defeated in the campaign, and a versus mode to take on a human opponent. Before starting, you have to choose a symbol, assign parameters to it (based on monster points, action points and power points) and buy a starter kit card deck. In a typical campaign game, you start in the entrance hall, where you manage your cards and monsters. To duel, you choose one of the four areas with five levels each, and defeat the opponents. New monsters are acquired by winning the match. The turn-based duels are played as a card game. Both characters start with a deck of cards and a number of health points. When a health status reaches zero, the battle is over. You attack your opponent by summoning monsters and assigning abilities to them. Trick cards can be used to gain both offensive and defensive advantages. Before each duel, you have to pick a monster that is up for ante, and the fighting is influenced by various parameters, including the land form you are playing on. On the game board, each monster is bound by a certain movement range and attack range. They can level up, evolve, or fuse to form more powerful creatures. The goal is to become King of Capsule Monsters, the highest rank in the Coliseum. If you have cleared the four areas, the final area, King Coliseum, will appear.</story>

Zombie Hunters 2 continues the series&apos;s hack and slash style of gameplay in the vein of Capcom&apos;s Devil May Cry or Koei&apos;s Dynasty Warriors games. This time, Aya is joined by her sister, Saki, and the mysterious Reiko as they must find the cause of a second Zombie outbreak. Retaining the Cool Combo system and the Rage and Blood meters found in the first game, The Oneechanbara 2 added some character specific moves, such as Aya&apos;s throwing knives, as well as smarter enemies, and new way&apos;s to defeat enemies. It also introduced a tag system to the series, allowing the player to select two characters and switch between them at anytime. Alongside the story mode, the game also featured the arena style survival mode and the quest system. All these features were improved slightly, with all the story levels being different, the survival arena&apos;s being unique, and the quest being much more varied. </story>

    <story>In Zombie Zone, you control Aya, a young girl who has lived with her father. An excellent swordsman, he has left his wife and the daughter Saki to live in a secluded place, teaching Aya sword techniques. His wife died, and Saki blamed the father for her death. She killed her own father, and went off to find an artifact to resurrect her mother. Now Aya must stop her own sister and avenge her father&apos;s death. The gameplay is hack-and-slash with some advanced things put in. You&apos;re fighting against zombies, so your enemies are not very smart. It&apos;s basically Aya against a very large number of slowly moving enemies, a bit like in Dynasty Warriors. There is a feature called sword fatigue- if you don&apos;t clean your sword in time, it will get stuck in an enemy, giving him an advantage over you. There are also slight RPG elements. You can upgrade your characters by collecting orbs dropped by defeated enemies. At the end of each level, you can use the orbs to make Aya more powerful. Sometimes the enemies drop red orbs; if you collect enough of them, you turn into a demon. Your attacks become more powerful, but they also take away from your health.</story>

    <story>The zoo animals have revolted against the zoo keeper. It is your job to restore order and capture all of the animals. In this fast-paced match-up game, players select animals of the same type using either the touch-screen or a standard controller. Line like animals up in rows by swapping them from spot to spot in the time allowed. There are five varied game play modes- Normal, Tokoton, Quest, Time Attack and 2P. Normal mode has you clearing a set amount of animals each level before progressing to the next. Tokoton is similar to Normal, but has all the animal amounts set to 100 before you&apos;ll level up. Quest has you playing ten set stages with specific goals (such as only capturing animals of a certain type) that you must attempt to achieve. Time Attack has you aiming to get the highest score possible in the time limit. 2P has two players battling it out against each other.</story>

    <story>ZooCube is a puzzle game that involves matching parts of animals to eliminate them and get points. The Cube is a 3D object in the center of the screen and the animal parts fall towards it. In a similar style to Tetris the player must keep the sides from building too high. It is a quickly paced, real-time game and at later stages the player struggles to juggle the cube items to keep eliminating animals on all sides. Power-ups can be used to destroy animal parts, get points, or to make life more difficult for the player&apos;s opponents, such as by speeding up the rate at which animal parts fall to their cube, or reduce how fast their cube can spin.</story>
