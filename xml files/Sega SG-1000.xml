    <story>Bandits are holding up a bank and have taken people hostage, and as a gunslinger, it&apos;s your job to shoot them. The bank has 12 doors, and the bandits are behind each one of them. When they pull a gun out at you when you open a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot them before they shoot you. If you shoot them too early (ie- before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair, and you won&apos;t score any points, but if you&apos;re too late, he&apos;ll shoot you and you lose one of your three lives. If you waste too much time, a bandit will come out from one of the doors and stick dynamite on it. You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it. If you&apos;re lucky, either a man or a woman will throw you a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. More often than not, the person will throw his/her hands up, saying I haven&apos;t got anything. That&apos;s when they will be replaced by bandits. Some men will carry three to five pieces of gold on top of their heads, and shooting at all of the gold will award you with a bag of gold coins. Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the rope, there&apos;s more money for you, because not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you&apos;ll get three bags of gold coins.There are more than ten rounds in Bank Panic, and each one ends when a person behind all 12 doors was able to throw you a bag of gold coins. The rounds get difficult the further you get. For example, in later rounds, a few bandits will block your shot, and you have to then shoot twice. Also, regardless of what round you&apos;re on, you can shoot so many bandits before time </story>

The player creates a party (up to five members) and explores a maze-like 3D dungeon, fighting random enemies on the way. The heroes also meet adventurers who can be convinced to join the party.

Making Jack&apos;s task difficult are numerous enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs.In each round, collecting a number of bombs results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting this coin will make the player&apos;s score increase 2 to 4 times. More often than not, the power ball appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the bombs. There is also the E coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin appear.The more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly to get you.</story>

    <story>Borderline is an overhead arcade shooter that puts the player in control of a Jeep in a war zone. The Jeep is equipped with a gun that has unlimited ammunition. Each round consists of four stages; after the player has completed all of them, the game proceeds to the next round, with increased difficulty. The first stage is a vertically scrolling shooter- the player can move the Jeep in all directions, shooting at enemies that try to destroy it by collision; the goal is simply to survive. The other stages share a different gameplay concept- the player has to navigate the Jeep towards enemy refineries and destroy them all. Enemy tanks will spawn indefinitely, trying to stop the Jeep. Parts of the stage are covered by bushes, and the Jeep has to furrow through them before advancing. In the third stage rockets can be picked up for bonus score. In the fourth and final stage the sole refinery is well-protected and shoots missiles at the Jeep. </story>

Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely.

    <story>You are Agent 17 (codename- Otto). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building. Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission- execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them- Shooting them with his gun. Kicking them by jumping onto them. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them. Crushing them with an elevator. Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark. While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he&apos;s already in an elevator if a bullet&apos;s trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn&apos;t mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don&apos;t have time to jump. Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building. If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn&apos;t go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It&apos;s virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.</story>

    <story>The simple little country girl Papri has a problem- her boyfriend Minto seems to show signs of interest towards another little girl, Cocco. Papri has to win his love back! The only way she can achieve that is by collecting flower bouquets, presenting them to Minto as a token of her feelings and gradually making him forget the other girl. Girl&apos;s Garden is Yuji Naka&apos;s debut and an early precursor of games with dating gameplay mechanics. Papri has to move through a confined top-down area, collecting flowers on the way. After having collected ten flowers, Papri can enter her boyfriend&apos;s house, completing a round and advancing to the next one, with the same goal but increased difficulty. Flowers must be picked up at full blossom; catching them too early will have no effect, while collecting wilted flowers will make Papri lose half of her bouquet. Papri&apos;s health is called love in the game, and is represented by hearts. She loses a heart if she falls into water or if a bear comes too close to her. Bears are roaming the area and can be temporarily distracted by dropping honey pots on the ground. Bees act as allies and will supply Papri with honey and bonus items that increase the score.</story>

    <story>Golgo 13 is a scrolling shooter based on the manga of the same name, putting the player in control of its main character, the assassin Duke Togo. In this adaptation, however, the protagonist&apos;s goal is, on the contrary, to rescue people. The screen scrolls horizontally, displaying Duke on a car that is moving along the road, trying to keep up with a moving train on top of the screen. The player can move the car left and right, aligning it with the train&apos;s cars. The goal is to shoot the train&apos;s windows, letting the people trapped inside run out. The player controls a crosshair, moving it in all directions, and presses the fire button to shoot. Between the player-controlled character and the train there is another track with a never-ending cargo train on it; tall cars of this train will not only block the crosshair&apos;s path, but also bounce the bullets back at Duke, hurting him. In later stages trucks will appear on the road and helicopters will shoot missiles at Duke.</story>

    <story>Deviating slightly from Compile&apos;s usual vertically scrolling fashion, Gulkave is a rather orthodox horizontal shooter. Flying across – or inside – a parallax scrolling landscape, your spaceship must singlehandedly take out eight fortresses. In your way stand enemy spaceships that either try to crush you or fire at you, as well as some asteroids thrown in for good measure. For each hit you take, your ship is not destroyed. Instead, you have a power (barrier) bar that decreases gradually until you finally lose a ship. At the end of each level, bonus points are given according to your remaining barrier. Losing a ship means you lose all your weapons upgrades as well. As usual with a shooter from this maker, the powerups come in the shape of numbered pods that are released from Zanac-style blocks. Different upgrades give higher shot counts, more simultaneous bullets or bigger energy waves. At certain score intervals, you&apos;re granted bonus ships.</story>

In order to get his cheese, Chumy must go between platforms connected by ladders, all the time avoiding the other creatures. Luckily, Chumy can jump very far, across and above the nasties. Chumy also has an arsenal of cans to throw at the enemies. Most die after just one hit, whereas others are more impervious to attacks. The rabbits are particularly dangerous, since they may pounce at you unexpectedly, they being able to jump just as far as Chumy. When Chumy eats cheese (or bombs or biscuits), he moves slower due to the extra weight. When the mouse has fed on all the cheese, it can take the dust chute down from the top level to the bottom, and make its way to the exit and on to the next level.

Skeet shooting and archery both come down to timing - though elevation and wind factors affect the latter. Gymnastics involves timing a succession of presses to ensure that the jump is long and the landing graceful. The triple jump involves one press for each part of the jump, whereas the weightlifting involves merely brute strength.</story>

There are 100 levels, and two types of levels. One is just locking down, the others you have to put them in a specific location. There are three levels of difficulty to choose from, you just get paid more the harder the level, and you have less time to complete the level.</story>

    <story>Safari Hunting is a port of the 1980 arcade machine Tranquilizer Gun. The play area is sort of a maze-like jungle scene with walkable paths and impassible jungle, you can venture into the jungle on foot to hunt the animals and you can also shoot from your truck at any animals that venture out into the 4 edges around the play area where your truck travels. Your task is to tranquilize different animals (snakes, gorillas, lions and elephants). The larger the animal, the more number of tranquilizer darts it takes to put the animal down. As soon as you tranquilize an animal, a timer will begin to count down and you will have to slowly drag the animal back to your truck before the timer reaches zero or the animal will awaken and kill you. Not only do you need to consider the countdown timer for a tranquilized animal, but you also need to watch your trucks fuel gauge, which is basically a time limit counter for the game as you apparently leave your truck running while walking through the jungle.</story>

There are several classrooms to explore like the Quantum Physics Room, Locker Room, Canteen, the Aerobics Dancing Class, and the Playground. In each classroom, Mikie has to collect all the hearts that are found in each classroom to form a message. In order to collect these hearts, Mikie must stand somewhere near them and shout out. There are two type of hearts- small and large. Mikie needs to shout out only once to collect the small hearts, and multiple times to collect the large ones. When a message is formed, Mikie can exit the classroom through a door marked OUT. Stopping him from collecting the hearts is the teacher, the chef, and the janitor. The teacher is the worst one. When he is unable to catch you, he works up a sweat, and eventually, throws his teeth at you. When his teeth hits Mikie, he loses one of his three lives. In later classrooms, Mikie can throw stuff at his enemies in order to stun them for several seconds (for instance, the basketballs in the locker room, and the chickens in the canteen). The janitor isn&apos;t as bad because he walks much slower than the others. In between levels, you have to enter the next classroom through a door marked IN without being caught, but you can do at least two things to pass time- Steal some lunch, and open one of the unmarked doors to receive a punch, a kick, or the chance to see a naked lady with breasts. Beware that if you take too long in the hallway and don&apos;t travel between floors, a bucket slides across the screen real fast and attempt to slip you.If you&apos;re good enough at the game, you can enter a high score, and if you fail to enter anything, the game will assume that you are Clint Eastwood.</story>

Crates can only be pushed one at a time (so two crates next to each other cannot be pushed together), and cannot be pulled--so it&apos;s possible to get a crate stuck in a corner, where it cannot be retrieved!

    <story>Star Jacker is a vertically scrolling shoot &apos;em up where the player controls a Universe Squadron whose job is to attack various enemy space colonies while evading or destroying the enemies UFO forces before returning to the Star Jacker mother ship. The main difference from other shooters is that the player here controls three space ships at once. As the front ship move the others follow its trail. This means that the player can shoot three shots at a time but it also means that enemy projectiles are harder to avoid since the ships take more space. However if hit the size of the squadron will decrease. The player has two means of attack- a regular fire for shooting down UFOs and a bomb attack for taking out ground targets. If a high score is attained a mystery target will appear. By destroying this the squadron will warp to the mother ship. The player will then be granted one extra ship and then game will continue. The game goes on until all ships in the squadron have been lost.</story>

That&apos;s why he has to explore deep dark forests, cross endless oceans, climb treacherous slopes, survive endless volcanoes, and even walk through clouds. But Tom-Tom will never be totally alone. You see, when he goes through the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom&apos;s only line of defense against these menaces. There are ten areas, each containing four rounds each, but the tenth area can&apos;t be accessed unless Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue mission. During his journey, he can break open different eggs that will reveal hatchets, skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian angels. You can ride the skateboard through each round, as long as you don&apos;t collide with an inhabitant. When you complete each round while still riding the skateboard, you&apos;ll start the next round still riding it. As you progress through each round, your vitality will start to get low, but it can be increased by getting milk, mushrooms, potato chips,or fruit that appear everywhere you go. As well as the normal eggs, there are also speckled eggs that must be avoided, otherwise the God of Death will be released, and once he follows you, you&apos;ll lose vitality much quickly. At the end of every fourth round, there is a king waiting to destroy you with his fireballs or lightning bolts. There are also warp-gates, but you don&apos;t find them, they find you. Warp-gates appear in rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one fruit, a special item will appear. These special items include handbags, wrist watches, a pair of shoes, a teddy bear, and a bottle of perfume. Another girl will appear and take you up to the clouds where the object is to collect as many hearts as you can without falling down or getting the item again. Once you have collected all the hearts, you can get the item to return to the surface, and more often than not, you&apos;ll get further in the round</story>

The aim is to keep destroying the enemies ships and planes until it is game over but the more you destroy then the higher the round you play on. You take control of two cross-hairs, one for firing bullets and the other for missiles and they both move together when you move them left or right which also moves your ship. When you move them up or down, then they move at different speeds and the bullets are for shooting down the planes and the missiles for the boats which has a short delay between firing. As the boats move across the screen from left to right they will fire missiles and torpedoes at you and these can be shot or avoided and if you are hit by one then you lose one of three lives. Two players can play and each player takes it in turns to play when the other player has been killed.</story>
