    <story>The story of Advanced V.G. follows a similar template as those of the previous Variable Geo games- the strongest young women in the country hold a tournament, which is sponsored by various restaurant chains, which in turn ask the competing girls to pose as waitresses working in said restaurants, for promotional purposes. The girls of the Jahana group who starred in the previous games return, with the new main protagonist being the young martial artist Yuka Takeuchi, who has been training in a secluded forest area before joining the competition. Like its predecessors, Advanced V.G. is a fighting game, with the basic kick and punch moves, while the various special attacks are executed by pressing combinations of buttons. There are three modes in the game, Normal, Vs., and Story. The normal mode is basically training matches between the player character and an AI-controlled girl. Vs. mode allows two-player mode, as well as demo computer vs. computer gameplay, with the possibility to choose any of the stages. Any of the eight heroines is available as a playable character in these modes. The story mode, on the other hand, allows the player to control Yuka Takeuchi only, and follow her story. Cut scenes advance the story between matches.</story>

    <story>The Cho Aniki series returns with their first sequel, the one that would cement the series humorous fetish with bodybuilders and other assorted stuff. As in the original Cho Aniki- Super Big Brothers, Ai Cho Aniki is a side-scrolling shooter in which you have to clear several stages of enemies with your flying avatar. Said avatar this time can be either of the two option bodybuilders that were supporting characters in the original while the original&apos;s main cast plays only small cameo roles as they appear every now and then to drop power-ups. Our two beloved speedo-wearing beefcakes also incorporate different play mechanics, as their attacks are often determined by button combinations (as in fighting games) which put a spin on the gameplay. Otherwise, the game&apos;s graphics and design are practically identical to the first game.</story>

    <story>Ryoran Girls&apos; Private Academy is a high-quality school, which specializes in arts and sciences, but also in martial arts. Each year the most successful students hold a fighting tournament. Each girl represents her specific area of interest (science, sports, music, etc.), and each wants to be the great winner, for her club&apos;s and her own glory. Asuka 120% Maxima is not particularly story-driven; the story mode allows the player to choose any of the ten available girls, each featuring a short introduction, followed by a linear progression of battles against computer-controlled rivals, with a few bits of dialogue before each battle. The versus mode allows the player to compete against any opponent controlled by computer, as well as two-player battles and a &amp;quot;watch mode&amp;quot;, in which the player assigns fighters to computer AI and watches how they unfold. The combat system follows a rather standard fighting game scheme; the girls execute a variety of kicks, punches, and attacks with special weapons, by pressing combinations of buttons. Girls might have unique weapons and techniques which are associated with the club/subject they represent; for example, a &amp;quot;tomboy&amp;quot; athletic girl will attack with baseballs and other sports accessories, etc.</story>

    <story>A devastating atomic war wiped out the biggest cities on the Earth and most of its population. Anarchy reigned, different military organizations fighting each other in a new war for dominance. One of such organizations eventually seized control of the planet, establishing itself as a tyrannic government and using advanced technology for military purposes. Only a lone pilot can save humanity from their clutches... Avenger is a vertically-scrolling shooter, in which the player navigates a plane through levels populated by hostile planes, tanks, cannons, ships, stationary devices, and massive boss enemies. Before each mission, the player can choose among different weapons in three categories- main, sub, and special. Main and sub weapons are fired simultaneously and have unlimited ammunition, while the powerful special attacks are accessed by pressing a different button and are limited. The player can try any combination of the three categories, for example enhancing the main rocket launcher with a pod that fires laser to the sides as a sub weapon, and a protective shield as a special one. Power-ups change properties rapidly, so the player has to catch them at a specific time to enhance either main, sub, or special weapon. Those power-ups do not change the properties of a weapon, but rather give it additional fire power.</story>

    <story>The game is based on the comedy TV show Yoshimoto no Shinkigeki, which in its turn is based on a theatrical comedy show popular in Osaka and its surroundings. The game stars characters that either look like the actors from the TV show and/or resemble characters played by them. The show consists of short episodes which are depictions of comical situations, and are not related to each other story-wise. Same can be applied to the game- there is no real story, just a stretch of hilarious and intentionally impossible situation the protagonists find themselves in. The setting is deliberately nonsensical, with the locations ranging from typical Japanese suburbs to ancient Japan, town in the American Old West, North Pole, etc. Scenarios are full of anachronisms- for example, one of the protagonists is sent in a space rocket to outer space from a desert near an Old West town, bumps into a planet, and falls back without taking any damage. Core gameplay is that of a platformer, more precisely an old-fashioned, Mario-type jump-and-run. Under normal circumstances, the protagonists have no weapons; the enemies are temporarily paralyzed (not killed) by jumping over their heads. The game contains a wealth of mini-games, most of which must be completed in order to proceed. The mini-games include- synchronized dancing (through QTEs), rock-paper-scissors variant with pizza throwing, cowboy-like shoot-outs, and many others.</story>

The other modes correspond to a league, a cup (knock-out stages only), and a versus mode, in which the player can also choose any opponent to compete against. In every mode, the player is able to choose between single match (one-on-one) and tag team, with an additional wrestler on each side. The league mode allows competition between up to four players. The combat system is similar to that of fighting games, with a side view and health bars for the wrestlers.</story>

    <story>Bazaru de Gozaru no Game de Gozaru is a puzzle game starring a monkey protagonist named Bazaru. The concept of the game is remotely similar to that of Lemmings- the player&apos;s task is to program the actions of the hero in order to safely traverse a stage full of traps and hazards. Unlike Lemmings, there is only one primate to control in this game; also, the player&apos;s programming must be performed before letting the monkey loose, unlike the real-time player input in Lemmings. The player basically orders the monkey what to do at specific spots (which are highlighted by exclamation marks on the level map). In the beginning the levels are short and simple, and the monkey can perform only one action. As the game advances, the puzzles become more and more complex, and so is the amount of actions the monkey must perform to reach safety. The actions include, but are not limited to- running, jumping (in both directions), rolling, pushing, sitting, etc. New actions are learned as the player advances. The player must study the level carefully and often predict the behavior of hostile characters as well as laws of physics, since the monkey can get easily trapped, killed by enemies, fall off cliffs, etc. For example, a wild boar will immediately charge at the monkey; using the momentum, the player can use the animal as a trampoline to jump to higher ground. Many levels can be solved in different ways. Alternate solutions are harder to figure out, but may lead to bananas, coins, and other things of interest.</story>

In this case, the heads clearly belong to the titular character of the Bomberman series. The game has similar gameplay and opponents as in the handheld version; Bomberman automatically advances on a &amp;quot;world map&amp;quot;, defeating opponents in falling block contests in a linear fashion. However, this is only one part of the game, the story mode. Two additional modes are- a versus mode, which allows multiplayer gameplay of up to five players, and a timed challenge mode. In the latter, the player has to complete specific falling block-related tasks before the time runs out.</story>

Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended. As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.</story>

The hit points of the robot depend on the condition of its shield. When the robot stands still, shield energy recharges slowly. Complete loss of shield energy makes the robot so vulnerable that the next hit destroys it.

As in Lemmings, the player has no control over the protagonist himself (except on a few occasions, when boss enemies must be defeated by throwing certain objects at them). Instead, the player must manipulate the environment in order to build a path for Melba, deal with the enemies, etc. Melba is for the most part entirely helpless and simply walks forward automatically.

The player can select the amount of rounds (minimum ten) needed to win a game and advance to the next opponent. The free play mode allows the player to choose the type of game actively, but the amount of available opponents is lower. There is no gambling in any of the games; points are awarded for combinations in poker and blackjack. The opponents undress after losing a game; however, they retain their underwear - there is no explicit nudity in the game.</story>

This athlete can be saved to disk and further improved during the course of time. For exhibition matches, the opponent can be built the same way. The game includes various hit types, depending on the player&apos;s position and timing. The direction of the ball can also be influenced when performing a shot. There are four different surfaces, influencing the gameplay, and three difficulty levels.</story>

    <story>Dekoboko Densetsu is a humorous game that combines elements of arcade action and racing. Up to five players can compete in the races. All the stages are vertically-scrolling (top-down), with the cars represented as small sprites of different colors. The player&apos;s goal is not only to beat the other cars, but also reach the finish line safely- each car has limited hit points, and continuously receives damage during the race. Damage can be sustained by driving over environmental hazards (pits, traps, bombs, etc.), failing to move the car forward in time (if the screen scrolls while the player-controlled car is at the bottom, it takes damage), being hit by the many enemies encountered in the game (which include a wide variety of wild animals, humans, fantasy creatures, monsters, etc.), or being hit by a competing car. Cars have the ability to jump over obstacles or enemy fire, avoiding damage. Over the course of the races, cars accumulate points depending on their results. These points can be invested in purchasing a limited amount of destructive weaponry (missiles, bombs, boxing glove that hits enemies from the side, oil to drop behind the car, etc.) or protective measures.</story>

    <story>Based on the popular Doraemon franchise, Nobita no Dorabian Night follows the adventures of the titular robotic cat, as he tries to rescue his friends from different time periods. How did this happen? Naturally, because of Nobita, Doraemon&apos;s best friend and geek extraordinaire. Something went wrong when Nobita was showing his friends a time machine, so they ended up stranded in hostile worlds, and now it&apos;s Doraemon&apos;s job to save them! The game is a traditional platformer; Doraemon&apos;s main activities are jumping his way through the levels and eliminating enemies who try to stop him. Doraemon starts with an ordinary gun, but later is able to find other weapons, including a homing bowling ball launcher and a stun gun. He can also collect various power-ups, such as limited invincibility, high speed, an item that freezes all the enemies on the level for a short time, etc. It is possible to switch weapons and power-ups at any time. Doraemon can enter different rooms and caves scattered through the levels. Some of them lead to mini-games (finding a correct way through a maze, memory games, etc.), which, in their turn, lead to significant power-ups, such as an extra life. The game has a symmetrical structure- each &amp;quot;world&amp;quot; is divided into four levels, the last one leading to the boss battle, after which Doraemon travels to another world.</story>

The Dragons must now embark on a mission to avenge her death and defeat the Black Warriors for the second and final time. The original arcade version of Double Dragon II was essentially an improved version of the first game. In addition to offering renewed audio and visuals, as well as new traps, moves and enemy characters, Double Dragon II discarded the conventional punch and kick buttons in favor of a direction-oriented attacking system similar to the original Technos beat-em-up Renegade. The NES version offered new stages, new moves and illustrated cut-scenes, as well as a new final boss and a new ending. Unlike the first NES game, it offered 2-Player Co-Op gameplay with the option to turn off the friendly fire. The Game Boy version of Double Dragon II is an English localization of a Kunio-kun game (the Japanese franchise which inspired Renegade and River City Ransom and has nothing to do with the arcade and NES versions.</story>

    <story>In this sequel to Down Load, the player once again takes control of Syd, a young cyber diver - a highly trained agent who is able to infiltrate the cyber world, a virtual reality network that has replaced real life for so many humans in this grim futuristic scenario of the end of the 21st century. This time, Syd is up against an even bigger menace- a terrorist organization that has taken possession of Adolf Hitler&apos;s brain, in order to re-create it in a digital for, thus effectively reviving one of the most vile and insane dictators in human history! Like its predecessor, Down Load 2 is a side-scrolling shooter; it shares many elements with the original game, such as the overall setting, virtual reality levels with abstract design (along with real-world locations), etc. However, the control scheme is a bit different. Instead of choosing a main weapon and a sub-weapon in the beginning of a mission, the player has four types of weapons and is able to switch between them at any time. In addition to the vulcan cannon and the laser beam, which were present in the first game, the player can also use homing missiles and a short-range, yet powerful lightning gun as main weapons here. All the weapons can be upgraded with power ups, up to three times each. Another type of a power up increases the speed of the ship (yes, Syd pilots a spaceship-like aircraft this time, not his trademark flying bike). Secondary weapons must be picked up, and include additional missiles, bombs, and protective shields. As before, powerful boss enemies must be defeated before proceeding to the next stage. Anime-style cut scenes with voice-overs advance the story.</story>

A wealthy school principal has placed a challenge for all the school gangs to compete in a special obstacle course composed of 4 different challenges that you and your team must overcome. First in line is a race across the city streets (and rooftops), next is an obstacle course filled with dangerous hazards, then a jumping challenge in which you have to break a series of metal balls, and finally an all-out fighting tournament. The game uses the same engine and basic gameplay mechanics featured in other Nekketsu High games, with the only change being the goals you must complete to clear each stage. Seeing as how the characters are gang members, fighting and beating your opponents can be a viable way of winning the challenges, so several weapons and power-ups can also be found in the courses</story>

With his powers of mind control and shape-shifting, he possessed Koruku&apos;s friends, turning them into terrifying monsters, kidnapped her sister, and burnt down the village. A mysterious old man approaches the desperate Koruku and bestows her with a wonderful armor, weapon, and magic powers. The young girl is ready to venture into Goatbone&apos;s lair and liberate her sister... but will she be able to defeat her own friends who now obey the word of their dark master? Fausseté Amour is an action platformer, somewhat similar to Valis games. The player navigates Koruku through large side-scrolling, platform-based stages, which culminate with boss battles. Koruku dispatches of the enemies with her regular weapon, a kind of chain that can be also used as a grapple, similarly to Bionic Commando- double-jumping allows Koruku to attach the grapple to a higher platform, swing, and jump on it. When Koruku is hit by an enemy, she loses her armor and continues to fight in her underwear; when she is hit again, she loses even the underwear, and dies (despite this somewhat provocative depiction, there is no explicit nudity in the game). Koruku can also use three kinds of offensive magic spells. Little fairies are scattered through the levels; when hit, they produce spare armor or orbs that can refill Koruku&apos;s magic energy. Anime-style cut scenes with voice acting advance the story between the stages. Audio CD tracks accompany the game during the cut scenes, and as background music for the stages.</story>

    <story>Feed Sluster is a fiend hunter- a man who takes job that involves elimination of mysterious beings known as fiends. One day he is contacted by a woman named Beth, who offers him a more demanding job, which involves investigating shady activities between humans and fiends, and getting to the bottom of the entire mystery, discovering the origin of the fiends and determine their ultimate fate. Fiend Hunter is a cinematic platformer set in an Old West-like environment with supernatural elements. With the exception of the initial town and a few other locations, the game is spent in areas that require carefully navigating Feed through a series of platform-like structures. Controls and animation resemble those of Prince of Persia. Feed can jump, run, perform a running jump, hang on ledges, pull up or drop down, kneel and crawl. He also takes falling damage; the primary challenge during platforming sequences consists of preventing him from falling down. Enemies only appear at pre-set points; each battle is one-on-one, and it is impossible to escape from a fight. Coupled with the enemies&apos; high HP count and varied attack patterns, this essentially turns each encounter into a boss battle. Feed fights with a sword and can perform various moves, combining attacks with jumping and ducking. He can also gain access to a few magic spells. A little fire fiend named Exy accompanies Feed on his journey. Exy can be used as offensive and defensive enhancement in combat, and can also be set to light dark areas. Each enemy drops a special orb that can be used to increase Feed&apos;s vitality, attack power, or magic, as well as teach Exy more powerful attacks, which gives the game a light RPG flavor. Feed can also equip rings and buy or find health-restoring and protective potions.</story>

Gameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western games. Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While it&apos;s possible to connect any of them from open situations, while grappling only when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves can be successfully used. </story>

Each ship can collect red, green, or blue power-ups; collecting a power-up of the same color enhances the currently equipped weapon, while a differently-colored power-up changes weapon properties while retaining whatever enhancements the ship might have had with the previous weapon. The actual properties of each weapon is different for each ship, and include various combinations of lasers, beams, missiles, piercing and homing weapons. Each ship also has two pods on the sides that fire simultaneously. If the player releases the fire button for five seconds, the pods will charge up and damage enemies with electricity during the next shot. In additions, the ships can also drop bombs that heavily damage all the enemies on the screen; up to two bombs can be carried at the same time. The stages include various themes such as medieval, feudal China, ancient Egypt, etc., all with a strong sci-fi angle. The player can continue up to nine times from the same spot if the protagonist runs out of lives, and additional continues are granted when the player gathers a sufficient amount of points.</story>

    <story>God Panic is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set in a cartoony, anachronistic version of feudal Japan with supernatural elements. There is no in-game background story or plot-advancing cutscenes, with the exception of a wise old man who would sometimes offer the cat-suit-clad hero some help. Creatures from Japanese mythology have gone wild, and it is up to the flying protagonist to defeat them, all the while defending himself against enraged villagers, mechanical cats, homoerotic wrestlers and other grotesque beings. The player character is armed with a standard gun in the beginning, which shoots in two lines straight in front of him. Power-ups are obtained by flying over treasure chests, usually placed on top of the screen. These grant the hero wingmen, additional shots, a new ray attack, extra lives, etc. Like in most scrolling shooters, a button is assigned to a powerful all-screen attack (in this case throwing coins) with limited charges. Stages culminate in boss battles, and some of them are built as a series of mini-boss encounters.</story>

The king has sent an army to rescue his daughter, led by a knight who was carrying the legendary Sword of the Valiant. All the soldiers were killed by the minions of the Demon God, and only the brave knight survived. But as he delivered the fatal blow to the Demon God, he was himself mortally wounded by him. The princess Misa has no other choice but to take the Sword of the Valiant and to find a way to escape from the Demon God&apos;s dungeon, full of deadly traps and enemies... Götzendiener (for some reason the title is German, meaning idolator), made by the creators of Princess Maker, presents its own take on rescue the princess story- here, there is nobody who can rescue the princess but herself. Armed with the sword, the princess must explore the isometric dungeon, fighting enemies in real-time combat and solving environmental puzzles on the way. The princess jumps automatically, and the actions in the game are limited to attacking enemies with a sword and pushing and pulling objects.</story>

    <story>Hawk F-123 is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up. There is no background story in the game and no cutscenes; the player pilots a fighter plane, flying over various areas such as a desert, a sea, a city at night, etc. Most of the enemies are different types of aircraft, though a few stationary turrets appear as well. The player-controlled fighter can pick up power-ups that change his primary weapon- red for a vulcan gun, yellow for energy bolts, and blue for laser. Each of these will increase in power (e.g. three lasers instead of one for the blue weapon) when the player repeatedly collects power-ups of the same color. Other power-ups add a secondary weapon or enhancement to any of the described above, such as homing missiles, fireballs, a wingman, etc. Secondary weapons are fired simultaneously with the main ones. In addition, special weapons can be collected and accumulated. These weapons are triggered by pressing a separate button, and include delayed bombs, exploding bullets, protective shields, and others.</story>

His daughter Chris travels to Central America in search of her father, and steps into an intimidating world of monsters and conspiracies. Hihō Densetsu- Chris no Bōken is a platformer. Chris is armed with a dagger and cannot use any other weapons or gadgets to protect herself. However, the dagger can be upgraded by collecting colored orbs dropped by enemies. Depending on their combination, the dagger can be used as a long-ranged weapon, firing projectiles or acting as a boomerang. The protagonist&apos;s health is measured with hearts; a stage must be restarted if Chris runs out of all five of them. Enemies would sometimes leave hearts and coins behind; the latter add an extra life to Chris if she collects a sufficient amount. A boss enemy awaits at the end of every second stage. Other features include moving and disappearing platforms, deadly traps such as spikes, mine cart-riding, and a strict time limit for each stage. The story is advanced through anime-style cutscenes between stages.</story>

    <story>Originating on the arcades (where it was known as Demon&apos;s World to the Western audience), Horror Story is an old-style side-scrolling platformer/shooter. The basic gameplay premise is very simple- shoot and jump your way through large amounts of monsters, defeat the boss, proceed to the next level. There is no narrative of any kind in the game, and no cut scenes; the hero is a tough-looking Duke Nukem-look-alike equipped with guns. The screen is scrolling at all times, even if the player character doesn&apos;t move. The levels are almost entirely linear, the only choice sometimes being to stay on the ground or jump to the higher platforms. Cooperative two-player mode is available. Though shooting is decidedly the main gameplay element here, jumping (particularly double-jumping) must be used liberally to navigate the hero through platform-based stages, and avoid and kill enemies (since jumping on their heads eliminates them as well). Weapons can be switched by catching power-ups, which appear as floating, constantly changing letters. Depending on the letter the player decides to take, the hero will get different weapons. These weapons include- a steady energy beam of moderate power; flamethrower; bombs; a short-distance grenade launcher of sorts; and a gun that spits fireballs in three different directions. As the name implies, the game has a horror theme. The game begins in what looks like old Japan, complete with traditional Japanese demons, but later switches to more mainstream horror, complete with haunted towns, ghosts, zombies, skeletons, etc.</story>

    <story>Side Arms Special is, in essence, the same game as the regular edition of the arcade side-scrolling shooter Side Arms (with audio CD tracks instead of MIDI music) - plus a new gameplay mode called Before Christ. This mode can be considered a hardcore mode, since the player has to return to the beginning of the level after the player character has died, as opposed to losing a life and continuing from the same spot in the regular mode. Also, while in the regular mode the player can change the type and direction of weapon (laser, spreading, etc.) at any time, in Before Christ mode, it is possible only upon picking up a corresponding power-up. Another change includes the ability to charge the weapon, similarly to the feature in R-Type. The charged beam is more powerful, but obviously requires more time to execute.</story>

    <story>After humans ventured into outer space, they began building colonies there. It became increasingly hard to maintain them, and special robots known as Bidroids were invented to do the hard work. However, the colonies began waging war on each other, and Bidroids were used for military purposes. When peace was finally achieved, the leaders decided that Bidroids could continue functioning as combat machines, but in friendly championships rather than in deadly wars. Hyper Wars is primarily a managerial simulation; robot combat itself is calculated depending on how the player created and maintained his or her robots. The player controls a manager of a team which competes in a league, complete with schedules, stadiums, etc. The player is given an initial budget with which he or she is able to create the first robot models and train them. Each robot can be created by merging together various parts (human, beast, bird, and so on). After creation, it is necessary to outfit the robot with weapons and upgrade its parameters by paying for training. When the player feels ready, the robots can be taken to combat arenas and participate in the tournament.</story>

Iga Ninden Gaō is a side-scrolling action game very loosely based on historical events, with plenty of anachronisms and supernatural elements. Gaō mostly uses his sword to defeat enemies; he can also jump and attack in mid-air. Sometimes it is necessary to jump over bottomless pits or other obstacles to advance. Pressing down the attack button will charge a special meter that will allow Gaō to throw knives at enemies. In addition, Gaō possesses special powerful all-screen attacks that come in limited quantities. Enemies may drop charges for such attacks, health-restoring items, and other power-ups.

The only time the background story is told is when the player selects a fighter in the story mode. Usually, the five good fighters have to face the five evil ones one after the other (each in different order) if selected in the story mode. Though the game&apos;s intro states that it is less about who is good and who is evil, and more about who is the better fighter... The gameplay is for the most part traditional fighting game-style (with the obligatory two-player battle mode as an option to the linear story mode); an important difference is the fact that some of the characters use swords and other weapons, rather than fight with their bare hands. The traditional kick and punch buttons are called short attack and long attack here; their execution is unique to each fighter.</story>

    <story>In 21st century, Tokyo was suddenly attacked by combined forces of robotic and organic alien races. A special giant mecha fighter craft was constructed in order to avert the threat. A young pilot is sent on the most dangerous mission of his life. Kiaidan 00 is a horizontally scrolling sci-fi shoot-em-up. The basic gameplay is similar to other games of this genre; however, the weapon system differs from the traditional power-up and upgrade style. The player character has all the weapons at his disposal from the very beginning. The five weapons include spreading energy blasts, focused multiple shot, laser beams that travel in different directions, an energy ball that protects the ship from frontal assaults, and an extended arm that hits enemies melee-style. The player can cycle through and choose any of these weapons at any time. Instead of the traditional secondary weapon system the game offers charged modes for all the weapons. When a weapon is charged it either becomes more powerful or gains new properties (for example, the extended arm becomes longer and is controlled from a distance). The player character&apos;s health is represented by shield units, which can also be picked up in the stages. Dialogue and cutscenes advance the story between and within missions.</story>

    <story>One day during a school break, a boy and a girl met in the yard and started drawing monsters and mechanical devices on the wall. Suddenly, a mysterious vessel appeared and swallowed the girl. All the creatures drawn by the children became alive - but so did a little fighter plane, which the boy immediately boards and goes up towards the skies, searching for the girl. L-DIS is a horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up with cartoon-like visuals and humorous overtones. The player can choose between three different weapon setups in the beginning. Power-ups are obtained by shooting little winged yellow creatures encountered in the stages. These power-ups rapidly change properties and can either enhance the strength of the main weapon, add a secondary one, or grant the protagonist protective shields or bombs that can eliminate all the enemies on the screen. Bosses and mini-bosses are present in most of the levels.</story>

In spite of the game&apos;s exclusively Japanese release, the protagonist delivers voiced monologues in English, musing over his mission, at the beginning of each stage. The game has a traditional power-up system with a basic weapon power-up that changes its color rapidly when revealed (red for vulcan gun, green for lasers, blue for missiles), as well as assorted collectible letters that either enhance the strength of the gun with additional shots, add a secondary weapon (such as bombs), or provide the ship with a protective shield. In addition, a powerful all-screen attack can be executed by pressing the second action button. At several points during the game the player is able to choose the next stage among two available ones. </story>

    <story>Mad Stalker is a side-scrolling mecha-themed brawler in which the player controls a character piloting a giant mecha (called Slave Gear in the game), fighting hostile robots unleashed upon the city by an evil mastermind. The player can choose between three playable characters- Chico Rodrigues, Richard Winston, and Eve Lurdia, each piloting their own version of a Slave Gear, distinguished by visual appearance as well as balancing of strength and speed. The game consists of six linear stages in which the protagonist has to eliminate all enemies on screen before advancing, typically facing a boss enemy at the end of a stage. All the enemies in the game are mechas. Player-controlled robots fight with fists or swords (Winston&apos;s mecha); they can also jump, kick, as well as grab and throw opponents. The game also includes a single- or two-player versus fighting mode in which players can choose to control the protagonists or enemy mechas.</story>

    <story>Martial Champion is a versus fighting game similar in concept to Street Fighter II. There are ten characters to choose from, each representing his or her own country. The main protagonist is a Japanese martial artist named Jin; others include his countryman Zen, a kabuki fighter; a Chinese kung-fu expert and a vampire from Hong-Kong; an Egyptian princess; a scimitar fighter from Saudi Arabia; a spear-wielding Kenyan warrior; a French weapons specialist; and two North Americans - an eyepatched soldier and a blonde female ninja-like fighter. There are three modes in the game- a tournament mode, in which these characters compete against each other before facing the final boss; a versus mode; and a group fighting mode, in which each player selects several fighters to represent in a series of one-on-one battles. The fighting scheme resembles that of Yie Ar Kung Fu, though with a simplified handling of high, medium, and low attacks. Some of the characters use weapons in battles; it is possible to knock these weapons out of their hands and use them against their owners.</story>

    <story>The plot of Metamor Jupiter is simple- a biological mutation causes an alien race to spread all over the galaxy. Armed with advanced technology, the aliens sent their machines and robots to face humanity in a cosmic battle. To counter that, the humans draw from the newly discovered crystal energy to deploy a unit of powerful fighter crafts, which can change their shapes in an instant, adapting to every situation. The player controls one of such crafts, and has to fly and shoot his way through side-scrolling levels populated by regular enemies, bosses, and various types of hazards. Other fighters will accompany the player-controlled machine from time to time, but they usually don&apos;t survive the robotic onslaught, and the player character is left to fend for himself. As the premise implies, the defining feature of the game is the fighter craft&apos;s ability to change shapes. The three main variations have two weapons each, which are suited for different situations. For example, one of the forms has vertical fire, but lacks powerful explosives; another can drop bombs, but has a slow forward beam attack, etc. Each of the forms can gather power-ups, which will strengthen the conventional weapons. Unlike most shooters of this kind, there are no lives; instead, the player-controlled plane has a set amount of hit points, parts of which are depleted when it gets hit. Hit points can be restored by catching power-ups scattered across the levels.</story>

    <story>Minesweeper is a minesweeping game, just like the one included in every copy of Microsoft Windows since ancient times. On a grid, the player clicks in a cell and hopes that it is not occupied with a mine. If it isn&apos;t, that cell is filled with a number, which indicates how many mines there are in adjacent cells. Using logical thinking, looking at the relations between different number cells, the player can conclude which cells contain a mine and mark them as such. Once all cells are revealed, the player progresses to the next minefield. Three main game modes are available, differentiated by the size of the minefield- 9x7, 12x12 and 18x14. Clearing a minefield takes the player to another one of the same size, but with more bombs to clear. A second mode is a mission mode (voyage mode in the PC Engine version), where the player is presented with 10 minefields each in 7 locations around the world. The first ones are very small, only 4x4, growing larger and larger from then on. What is different about the mission mode is that a few cells in the minefield are revealed from the start, putting the player&apos;s ability of deduction at test. The editor mode allows players to construct a minefield of their own, by inputting parameters of size and amount of bombs. The Game Boy version can also be played by two players via a link cable. The PC Engine (TurboGrafx CD) version contains an additional mode entitled Cook&apos;s Quest, in which the player has to help a cook to escape from falling boulders in a cave, represented by mines on a familiar minesweeper field.</story>

    <story>Mirai Shōnen Conan is based on Hayao Miyazaki&apos;s anime series Future Boy Conan, itself an adaptation of the novel The Incredible Tide by Alexander Key. In 2008, a devastating war between two super-powers led to a nearly complete destruction of the Earth. The continents sunk into the oceans, and only a few islands remained. Conan is a boy who grew up on one of those islands, a descendant of one of the survivors of a spaceship crash. He meets a girl named Lana, who later gets kidnapped by soldiers of Industria, a developed island with centralized administration. Conan travels to Industria and is determined to rescue Lana, uncovering a much greater conspiracy in the process. The game plays like a fairly traditional platformer taking place in predominantly maze-like environments connected by exit areas. Conan can jump, duck, and fight enemies with his fists. He can also use a limited numbers of ranged weapons such as spears.</story>

Every course only occupies one screen, and the player has to complete laps faster than AI-controlled cars or race against time. Multiplayer (for two or four players) is also available. Time attack mode allows the player to select any course from twenty-five available ones, thematically grouped in five categories- Circuit (resembling racing tracks), City (urban locations), Nature (field, beach, desert, etc.), Märchen (colorful fairy tale-like courses), and Special (unorthodox designs, e.g. a giant ape overlooking a road). Courses usually include various hazards that slow down or trap cars, as well as turbo fields that speed them up. Some courses also have entrances and exits, which teleport cars to another location on the screen.</story>

She fights the monsters who have suddenly invaded the city, and is summoned to the parallel world known as Vecanti, which is ruled by a cruel tyrant named Rogles, whose actions disrupt the balance of the the worlds. Wielding the legendary Valis sword, Yuko must defeat Rogles and restore the balance. Valis has the same story and basic genre (platform action) as the original first game in the series; however, it is a different game with different locations, regular enemies and bosses, new cutscenes, etc. Defeating the numerous enemies populating the game world requires precise usage of jumping and ducking abilities, and attack timing. Yuko can jump very high and attack while jumping. Various power-ups are scattered through the game, many of which enhance the performance of Yuko&apos;s sword. Acting as a melee weapon in the beginning, it can be customized with power-ups and turn into a medium-range weapon, firing shots at the enemies - with proper power-ups, also in different directions. Boss enemies typically have different attack patterns and require different strategies to defeat them.</story>

When you play a one player game you play the world cup as one of the top soccer countries of that time, and you meet countries in a fixed order. Cameroon in the first match and the final is against West Germany. In an old-school fashion you lose when you play a draw, there&apos;s no extra time whatsoever. In the game you always steer only one character, which you choose before the match starts. You can then give simple orders to you team-mates, like pass, tackle and shoot. Your moves are also limited to these moves. The game is totally lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles without a wink from the referee.

Unfortunately, every time a bounty is a near something goes wrong- the last case was particularly painful, involving Mail bravely cutting off the head of a famous criminal - only to realize that his body escaped without the head. Mail tried at least to sell the head in the nearest town, but discovered that the local tavern was full of these heads stored in a basket. But not all is lost- Mail reads a poster that promises a big reward for someone who catches an evil wizard who terrorizes the land. Sounds like just the job Mail was looking for! This version of Popful Mail is quite different from later releases, even though it has the same story and basic gameplay. However, the layout of locations, regular enemies, bosses, concrete events - everything is entirely different. This version is less of a fast-paced platformer and is more focused on exploration, with more maze-like levels and back-tracking. As in the other versions, there are friendly areas where Mail can buy weapons, armor, and items. There is no attack button- Mail attacks by simply running into enemies or jumping on them. </story>

Each character can also acquire additional weapons by picking regular power-ups. The game&apos;s stand-out feature, however, is its transformation mode. Each of the characters can transform to a larger and much more powerful biomechanical insect-like ship. The transformation can be performed at any time as long as the correspondent bar, which refills itself over the time, is not empty. The bar is reduced rapidly when the character is transformed; special power-ups can be collected from vanquished enemies to extend it temporarily, but once it is depleted the character transforms back to his or her normal form.</story>

    <story>A year after the release of the falling block puzzle game Puyo Puyo for MSX and Famicom, an arcade version was released that took the basic concept, but transformed it from a solo into a competitive game, changing the series fundamentally- all ports and later entries in the series are based on this version. The original arcade version has two modes- a single-player story mode and a two-player competitive mode. In story mode (which is based on characters from Compile&apos;s RPG series Madō Monogatari), the player controls Arle Nadja (Silvana in the English translation of the arcade version), a young sorceress, whose goal is to defeat Satan. To do so, she has to win 12 battles against his minions until she can meet him in a final confrontation. The game offers an extra training mode against three lesser opponents, as well as the ability to start from level 4 of the main game. During a match, pairs of puyos fall down from the top of the screen into each player&apos;s field. They can be moved left or right, rotated in either direction and made to drop faster. The goal is to arrange puyos of the same color into patterns of at least four, with horizontal or vertical (but no diagonal) connections. Doing so removes them from the field (with any unconnected puyos falling down) while at the same time sending garbage blocks into the opponent&apos;s field. Creating patterns of more than four, several different patterns at the same time, or chain reactions creates more garbage blocks. The garbage blocks can only be removed by creating patterns adjacent to them. The player whose playing field reaches the top first loses. In single-player mode, the falling speed of the puyos increases level by level and each of the enemies plays in a unique style. The home ports also add an endless single-player mode, in which there is no opponent (and thus no garbage blocks) and one simply plays for a high score, similar to the MSX/Famicom version. Unique to the Game Gear version is an additional quest mode. Similar to the mission mode of the original MSX/Famicom version, it presents a series of pre-filled playing fields with a specific task, like making a minimum number of puyos disappear in one move, or removing all puyos of a certain color. Progress is saved via passwords.</story>

    <story>The follow-up to Puyo Puyo is, like its predecessor, a falling block game in which the goal is to combine four or more blocks (Puyos) of the same color, which then disappear. The remaining Puyos will then fall down and can produce combos which can cause special blocks (Nuisance Puyos, that can only be destroyed by eliminating adjacent Puyos) to appear on the enemy&apos;s field.</story>

    <story>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot &apos;em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay. You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire. The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called The Force, which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements). The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger&apos;s artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot&apos;em&apos;ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type&apos;s contemporary rival, Gradius.</story>

    <story>Like most games based on the Ranma 1/2 manga and anime series, Datō, Ganso Musabetsu Kakutō-Ryū! is a fighting game. Unlike the earlier Ranma 1/2 iteration by the same company, this game does not follow the main manga/anime story, and does not include any other gameplay elements beside one-on-one fighting. However, the game is still rich on story-telling; fully voiced anime-style cut scenes appear after each battle and serve to put Ranma in various situations and set the stage for battles against familiar character from the manga and anime, such the old pervert Happousai, Mousse, Ryuga, etc. The Vs. mode allows two-player gameplay; the players can choose any combinations of the characters who appear in the game to test their skills. As Ranma, the player can revert to his female form (this time at will, simply by pressing a button); the female Ranma is more agile but less powerful. The combat system includes characteristic fighting game mechanics, with punches, kicks, jumps, combinations of buttons to execute specific moves, and powerful special attacks, which can be executed after charging the power.</story>

    <story>Based on the popular manga/anime series of the same name, Ranma 1/2 follows the story of an aspiring martial artist who accidentally turns into a young woman by bathing in a cursed spring. He can revert to his natural form by touching hot water; however, contact with cold water will turn him into a girl again. Most of the original manga story is dedicated to semi-comical situations, based on the fact that Ranma is trying to conceal his predicament, which leads to misunderstandings, confusion, and romantic complications in his high school life. This interpretation of the license follows a part of the initial manga story, starting with the curse and going through Ranma&apos;s first conflicts with schoolmates and rival martial artists. The game is mostly structured like a beat-&apos;em-up side-scroller, though there are also several boss fights that are more reminiscent of a one-on-one fighting game. The Vs. mode allows the player to recreate these boss fights using different characters. Ranma&apos;s curse becomes a gameplay feature in the game- cold and hot water turn Ranma into a girl and a boy, respectively. Female Ranma is quicker and can jump higher, but her attack and defense are lower. Anime-style cut scenes advance the story between the levels.</story>

Like its predecessor, it is a horizontally scrolling shooter that puts the player in the role of a lone fighter pilot who has to protect Earth against the invasion of biomechanical aliens serving the Zoul Empire. As in most games of its kind, the action revolves around shooting waves of continuously attacking enemies, facing bosses to terminate stages. The player can collect colored power-ups that will modify the ship&apos;s weapons, turning them into an explosive gun (red), flame laser (green), and multi-way fire (blue). These power-ups are constantly rotating, and picking them up at specific moments will change the direction they are facing - up, down, left, or right. By holding the attack button the player can charge the ship&apos;s power, unleashing explosive attacks. It is also possible to increase the ship&apos;s speed for a quick thrust, which makes it easier to evade enemy fire.</story>

As people are being evacuated, a lone fighter pilot is entrusted with protecting the ship. However, he cannot ward off the alien onslaught, barely escaping the carnage himself. The mother ship is destroyed, and the humans are driven to a desperate move- venture into the core of the alien world, taking the war to them. The only one brave enough to go on this suicide mission is the same pilot who has protected the Earth before. Rayxanber III is a horizontally scrolling shooter that retains the gameplay elements of its predecessors in the series. As with the previous installments, the game&apos;s two distinguishing features are rotating power-ups (which must be collected at specific moments to change the aiming direction of the ship&apos;s weapons), and the ability to quickly dash with the ship, evading enemy fire. A new feature is a special bar that can be charged up, resulting in a powerful attack that sends two homing missiles towards the enemies.</story>

The two characters begin with different initial stages, but continue on the same path afterwards. Seishiro is physically weaker and has a default ranged energy attack; Fujiro fights with regular punches and kicks. Both characters have access to unique elemental attacks that are activated by holding down a button. Most of the stages are straightforward side-scrolling action with boss battles at the end of each; a few areas contain light platforming elements.</story>

The player controls a car from an into the screen 3rd person perspective, racing through the 17 pseudo-3D courses (named after various geographical locations, e.g. West Coast etc.). There are other cars on the road, which can slow down the player-controlled car by colliding with it, but the race is against time rather than against these cars. The player is given a time limit for each course, and an indicator shows how close the car is to the completion. Should the car run out of time, the race is lost, and the player has to replay it before tackling the next one. The car can be controlled with two buttons only; collisions do not damage the car, but merely make it stop; though the player can change a car model and gear system, no realistic gear-based driving is used in the game. All this contribute to the overall arcade feeling of the races.</story>

    <story>Released specifically for Naxat Soft&apos;s Summer Carnival of 1993, Nexzr Special is a collection of short stages and modes that share their basic gameplay system and visuals with Nexzr. The regular mode introduces familiar regular enemies and a few new bosses. The Carnival Mode contains Score Attack and Time Attack modes, both requiring the player to focus on attaining the high score rather than just surviving. For that reason the difficulty in these modes is more forgiving; they allow more continues and have more generously placed power-ups. These modes also offer more destructible objects on the screen, as these specifically serve to increase the score.</story>

    <story>Super Albatross is a golf game. There are three modes available- training, match play, and tournament. Match play is essentially a story mode that casts the player in the role of a young man whose mother has passed away and who tries to find solace in golf. In this mode, opponents must be defeated in a linear fashion and courses are dictated by the story. In training and tournament modes the player can choose between six different courses. The tournament mode is a competition between various characters who appeared as opponents in the match play mode. The golf game itself is viewed from a top-down perspective at all times, and allows the player to choose the type of club as well as adjust the angle and the strength of the shot.</story>

    <story>Darius was Taito&apos;s effort to compete in the arcades against the likes of R-Type and Gradius. Technically impressive, it featured three screens depicting the largest playfield seen in a game so far (the same system was employed for Ninja Warriors), with the player sitting atop a big set of loudspeakers. Visually and audibly, it was a league above Irem&apos;s and Konami&apos;s offerings. When Taito (and others) ported the game to home machines, they were forced to shrink the playfield to fit in one single screen, and re-dubbed it Darius Plus. The plot of Darius involves the two heroes Proco Jr. and Tiat Young fighting the menaces posed by galactic fish and other sea animals again their homeworld. What sets Darius apart from other shoot&apos;em-ups of the time is its way of letting the player choose his path with a certain amount of freedom. At the end of each area (level), you are able to choose between one of two worlds which the area branches into. This renders a higher replay value, since there are many paths to reach the end of the game by. Apart from this, the gameplay is on the simplistic side, both due to unimaginative attack waves and little interaction with the surroundings, but mainly due to the very basic powerup system, which is nowhere near the complexity of the aforementioned R-Type&apos;s and Gradius&apos;.</story>

    <story>Sylphia is set in an environment inspired by the Greek mythology. The heroine of the game was a fearless maiden who tried to protect her home town from the onslaught of monsters. But even her power was no enough, and she was slain... Touched by her sacrifice, the goddess Athena revived her as a flying demi-goddess. Restored to new life, Sylphia can now unleash her wrath upon the monsters and their supporters. Despite its theme and setting, Sylphia plays like a vertically scrolling shooter. As in most games of this kind, the gameplay consists of shooting down waves of enemies, on the ground and in the skies. Sylphia can use four types of ranged attacks, which roughly correspond to other shooters&apos; traditional weapons- fire blasts, laser, spreading fire, homing missiles. These weapons are displayed as colored orbs and must be collected. Power-ups can be collected for each type of attack. In addition, a devastating special attack can be stored (for one charge) and executed.</story>

    <story>Originating in the arcades, Dynasty Wars is a beat-em-up set during the Three Kingdoms Era of the Chinese history, and is, more specifically, based on the Tenchi o Kurau manga adaptation of the story. The player adopts the identity of an ancient Chinese warrior, and riding on horseback has to eliminate all his opponents, mostly infantry and archers. Four historical characters from the time period can be controlled- Zhang Fei (fights with a halberd), Liu Bei (broadsword), Guan Yu (a Chinese pole weapon known as guan dao), and Zhao Yun (pike); some of the character names are misspelled in translated versions. The characters are distinguished by their health and strength parameters. The game uses a lateral scroll and the player can move in all four directions. A novelty is the attack system- when pressing fire the energy of the attack will load up as the warrior moves his weapon up and backwards, in order to gain momentum. The more the player can keep fire pressed, the more powerful the attack will be. In addition, so-called tactics can be used at specific moments; these are powerful area attacks that deplete the protagonist&apos;s HP in process and range from summoning an ambush partner and causing rocks slide down slopes. Stages typically culminate in boss battles. Along the way, various power-ups can be collected. Besides treasure that increases the player&apos;s score, and food packs that heal the protagonist, there are also yellow and blue orbs, which represent the game&apos;s light RPG elements- yellow orbs count as experience points and increase the character&apos;s vitality after a stage is over, and blue orbs increase the power of his weapon.</story>

    <story>Eple is a young girl donning a penguin costume, who lives in a secluded village in a snowy region of Northern Japan with other humans and birds. One day, following a monster attack on the village, Eple and her penguin friend fell into the water and drifted to faraway lands. The duo must face fearsome enemies and dangers to find a way back home. Travel Eple is a top-down action game similar in concept to Bomberman. The game is divided into stages, each consisting of one screen. Every stage has an opponent who tries to kill Eple either by attacking directly (most regular enemies only have close-range attacks, but bosses may not follow this rule), or by throwing objects at her. Eple, on the other hand, has no attacks on her own and must rely on these objects (mostly explosives such as bombs and grenades) to hurt the enemy. Objects keep appearing randomly in various parts of the screen as long as the battle continues. Stages may contain hazardous areas that damage Eple, or other spots that prevent her from walking around normally. Health-restoring pots also pop up from time to time. A few stages require Eple to access a magic staff, which grants her various protective abilities (e.g. an ice force field that absorbs fire damage). A versus mode is available, in which players compete against each other by controlling Eple and her friend Pal. Their magical abilities can be customized before the battle begins.</story>

    <story>The TV Show is a humorous overhead action game similar to Bomberman in concept. The game consists of a scenario mode (single-player) and a versus mode (up to four players). Both modes offer seven characters to choose from. The characters are comically-themed and include a hyperactive schoolgirl, an armored ninja, and others. There is no real storyline behind these characters; each comes with a short introduction sequence that invariably leads to their admittance to an alien-organized TV show, where they have to defeat enemies and retrieve prizes. Each stage is an overhead screen containing the protagonist, enemies, the prize, and several bombs. The bombs should be picked up and carried around; they are used to deal with enemies and blow up the receptacle in which the prize is contained. The green bombs change their color to yellow and red when picked up, at which point they are about to explode and have to be thrown to avoid damage. Bombs also blow holes in the terrain, and the player must pay attention not to fall through. In addition to bomb-carrying and bomb-throwing, each character possesses a special ability. These range from throwing projectiles at enemies to speeding up when driving a bike, depending on the selected character.</story>

    <story>King Asfal from the Dark World had a son named Galgear, who inherited a magic ring from him and grew insane as a result. The prince was imprisoned, but managed to break free, kidnap Valna, the queen of Vecanti, and install himself as the Dream Land&apos;s new ruler. Cham, the leader of the resistance against Galgear, hears the voice of Yuko, the former Valis soldier who has now become a goddess, telling her that one of the resistance members, a girl named Lena, is the heir to the Valis sword. Lena and her sister Amu decide to rescue Valna and find a way to stop Galgear. Like its predecessors, Valis IV is an action platformer. It is similar to the previous game in allowing the player to control three different characters- Lena, Amu, and Asfal. Each of the characters wields a unique weapon (Valis sword for Lena, boomerang for Amu, and lance trident for Asfal) and has access to their own elemental spells (thunder for Lena, fire for Amu, ice for Asfal). Each one also has a special ability- Lena can slide through narrow passages, Amu can double-jump, and Asfal is immune to certain traps. Along with recovery and spell-enhancing (up to three levels) items, characters can also acquire special spheres that increase the overall count of their hit- and magic points.</story>

But one day, a messenger brings terrible news- the castle of Farland was attacked, the king, the princess, and countless soldiers brutally slain. Zomu Dizae, the third and the final demon commander of the dark world Zekisis (Latok has defeated the other two, Badu and Gospel), has arrived. He is aided by the treacherous Necromancer, who turned the soldiers of Farland into monsters. Will Latok be able to defeat the evil once again? Xak III- The Eternal Recurrence is an action RPG, similar in gameplay style to its predecessors, but also incorporating some elements first introduced in Tower of Gazel, such as the ability to jump and having companions (although this feature is much more limited here). Jumping ability is crucial in many cases, as there are obstacles that can only be avoided by jumping over them. Latok starts at level 50, but still can gain experience points and become stronger. A new (and very useful) feature is hit points restoration, which occurs when Latok is standing still. To counter that, enemies can re-spawn, which means that there aren&apos;t many completely safe areas in the game.</story>

The two games share the same basic story, but have many differences regarding concrete events, locations, gameplay details, etc. The events of the game take place a short while after those described in Ys II, and before the events of Ys III- Wanderers from Ys. As the game begins, Adol and his friend return to the town of Minea, where the first game began. The evil Lord Darm has been defeated, and it&apos;s time to relax and spend some time with friends - but not for long. A new evil is rising, and Adol decides to set sail for the overseas land of Celceta to investigate these occurrences. Ys IV returns to the style of play used in the first and second games. The gameplay area is viewed from a top-down perspective, and the player attacks enemies by running into them to cause damage. Combat is slightly more sophisticated than in the first two games, since Adol can now move in eight directions, and attacking enemies diagonally or from the sides is more efficient than bumping into them headstrong. Adol gains experience from defeating enemies, which serves to raise his attack and defense power, like in the previous games. He can equip various swords, armor, shields, and rings to enhance his attributes. The magic system introduced in Ys II is also brought back for this game.</story>

The player selects one of the five characters (Yusuke, Hiei, Kurama, Kuwabara or Genkai), and is then taken to a series of one-on-one shoot-outs in a pre-determined order. The enemy is viewed from a first-person perspective, and the player moves a cursor to aim and shoot. The gameplay system is fairly simple, allowing the player to execute three types of attacks- regular shots, charged shots, and special attacks of limited quantity. Points are received for winning fights and can be used to raise the characters&apos; hit points, speed, or number of special moves.</story>

Each weapon has three levels of power, and to obtain those, similar upgrades must be collected sequentially. However, what makes the game unique is the ability to use a traction beam to trap an enemy and then throw him against his peers, destroying them. The game (more precisely, the European PAL version of it) is known for being the origin of the grammatically incorrect phrase in the English translation, All your base are belong to us, which has since become an internet phenomenon. </story>
