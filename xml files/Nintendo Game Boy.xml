You can play against the CPU or a second player, using the same Game Boy or, if you have the game link cable, two Game Boys. Unlike the previous cart, there is no skill selection.</story>

    <story>This puzzle-game is the successor to Kwirk. The player has to guide a small potato to the exit of each level, which is made difficult by a number of obstacles. Crates have to be pushed out of the way or into holes to make them traversable. Difficulty is increased by the fact that there are crates and holes of several different shapes and sizes and many levels contain different types of spinning doors. The game features four different modes of play- Beginners Mode in which the basics are explained and the player receives hints on how to solve each level; Practice Mode that lets the player choose the size of the levels which are then randomly picked; Puzzle Mode in which the player has to complete 40 levels and receives a score depending on the time it took him to complete a level; and finally Action Mode, which is basically a story mode containing two stories. The game also features a password system and four different difficulty levels.</story>

    <story>The Addams Family- Pugsley&apos;s Scavenger Hunt is a side-scrolling platformer based on the second animated TV series The Addams Family (1992). The entire Addams family is being held captive by various monsters throughout the mansion, and Pugsley needs to rescue them. They are hidden in various parts of the mansion, e.g. the forest, which can be accessed in any order. The gameplay follows the usual platforming standards- Pugsley moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. This version of the game is heavily based on the SNES version of The Addams Family - it features the same storyline with another main character and almost identical level design. Another difference to the SNES version of this game is that Pugsley can only take two hits before dying - but there is an additional power-up that makes him faster and gives him an extra hit.</story>

    <story>The Addams Family is a side-scrolling platformer based on the movie of the same name. The player takes the role of Gomez who searches for his missing family members. To find them he has to explore six different parts of the mansion, e.g. the forest or the graveyard, which are basic platform levels- the player moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. In contrast to the other versions of the game he has weapons to his disposal, e.g. a throwing knife. Other differences are a unique level design and another health system- Gomez has five hearts which practically act like a life meter because every hit only takes away a part of a heart.</story>

That is until the Evil Witch Doctor decides to capture the Princess Leilani and hold her as his own. It&apos;s up to Master Higgins to gather throwing axes, fireballs and skateboards in order to aid his noble quest. The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.</story>

    <story>In Adventure Island II- Aliens in Paradise the player takes the role of Master Higgins who has to save his cavegirl from aliens which also want to dominate the Earth. The basic gameplay elements are the same as in its predecessor Adventure Island- Master Higgins walks through the levels while fighting against various enemies. One hit results in his untimely death unless he carries one of the various power ups, e.g. weapons or a skateboard which improves his speed. He also needs to collect food to fill up his steadily decreasing starvation bar - death awaits if it hits zero. A big addition are dinosaurs which serve as mount and offer different abilities, e.g. flying or shooting fireballs. Like all power ups these don&apos;t have to be used instantly but can be saved for later- before every level the player can choose the power ups he wants to bring with him. There are overall eight worlds with different themes which are represented by a overhead map. Sometimes there are different paths with other level and at the end of a world Master Higgins has to fight a boss.</story>

In each room, you have to collect all heart frames in order to open a treasure chest which contains the key to the exit. Different terrain types and enemies have to be avoided or used to your advantage to get all the heart frames. Some enemies don&apos;t hurt you at all, others only awaken once all heart frames are collected. Some shoot you as soon you cross their line of sight, then there are enemies that fall asleep and stay where they are once you touch them. Terrain types include grass that enemies cannot cross, sand that slows you down, but not the enemies, stones that cannot be crossed but also block enemy shots, trees that cannot be crossed but don not block enemy shots, water that can only be crossed with a bridge or an egg, arrows that cannot be crossed in the direction opposite that of which they are facing and others. Some heart frames give Lolo the ability to turn enemies into eggs and push them around like boxes. Eggs can be used to cross water, trap enemies or block their shots. In some levels, collecting two heart frames gives Lolo access to one of three items. These items are- A hammer that crushes stones, a bridge that can be used to cross water and an arrow that changes the direction an arrow tile is facing. At the end of each level you receive a password.</story>

    <story>The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is the video game adaptation of the 60&apos;s cartoon series staring Bullwinkle, a moose, and Rocky, a flying squirrel. The game plays out much like an episode of the show. The story begins at the dedication of the Frostbite Falls Rocky and Bullwinkle museum. Unfortunately, the not-so-nice Boris and Natasha have disguised themselves as security guards for the museum and managed to steal some of the priceless artifacts. Bullwinkle and Rocky must track down the stolen artifacts and return order to Frostbite Falls. Most of the action is of the side-scrolling platformer variety, but along the way, you will get to play lots of mini-games involving characters from the show. During the platforming sections you can switch instantly between the two protagonists. Both play differently- Bullwinkle can throw bombs at enemies and Rocky can fly for short instances.</story>

The Sultan&apos;s guards and also animals of the desert want to hinder Aladdin in his way. He can defend himself with his sword or by throwing apples. Next to apples, Aladdin can also collect gems which can be traded for lives and continues with a traveling trader. Finding Genie or Abu icons enables bonus rounds. The Genie bonus round is a game of luck played for apples, gems or extra lives. In Abu&apos;s bonus round, the player controls the little monkey who has to catch bonus items that fall from the sky, but without touching any of the unwanted objects like rocks and pots.

However, when the Predators move in for the hunt, they find they are vastly outnumbered and suffer the same fate. Only one of them survives. He theorizes that among the hatched Aliens there was a queen that laid additional eggs, which would explain the huge number of Aliens. The last survivor sets out to destroy the queen and regain the honor of his clan. The Predator must traverse several side-scrolling levels on his way to the queen, while destroying Aliens in all their forms - facehuggers hatched from eggs, chestburster aliens and fully grown warriors. Various weapons are available- the standard weapon are the wrist blades. Ammunition for the shoulder cannon, the cutting disks and bombs must be picked up. The bombs not only work as weapons but can also be used to destroy barriers. To avoid a fight altogether, the Predator can also use his invisibility system, which runs down the energy supply. To recharge it, energy powerups must be collected. Also hidden in the levels are keys that open up doors blocking the way into the next area. A small radar map helps in navigating the maze-like corridors and also displays approaching enemies.</story>

The goal of the level is to fill all squares out. A life is lost by touching an enemy or running out of time.</story>

    <story>Being the predecessor of Asterix and Obelix for SNES, this game features the same story as it&apos;s later counterpart - however the level design was massively changed, doesn&apos;t offer a 2 player mode and level codes were added only for the GameBoy Color version. To show Caesar the power and freedom of your village, you have to collect various trophies from all over Europe. To do this, you can select Asterix or Obelix and move them through various levels while beating up Roman soldiers, collecting coins and avoiding gaps or other obstacles. Various special levels like crossing the sea to Great Britain by boat (and beating up some Romans again) or freeing Rugby players captured by the Romans are scattered across the game and provide variety between the classical Jump &apos;n Run levels. Most levels additionally have a time limit to make things a bit harder, though the difficulty of the game can be adjusted. There&apos;s an overall of four different countries, all of them based on comic books of the series (namely- Asterix in Britain, Asterix in Switzerland, Asterix at the Olympic Games, Asterix in Spain). At the end of each of these stages you have to contend in a contest typical for the country and also taken from the plot of the comics- In Britannia you take part in a rugby match, in Switzerland you have to blast safes, in Greece you take part in the Olympic games and in Spain you have to fight against (or run from) a bull - victory will get you the desired trophy!</story>

When all asteroids are destroyed, the player can then move on to the next round. In addition to the asteroids, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen. The player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process. Asteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed. There are three types of asteroids- large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes- small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.</story>

    <story>Atomic Punk, which was released as Dynablaster in Europe and Bomber Boy in Japan, is a game from Hudson Soft&apos;s Bomberman series. The game offers two single player and two multiplayer modes. The single player mode called Game B has the classical Bomberman gameplay, while the mode Game A introduces several variations. The levels in Game A are divided in nine areas, which can be accessed in any order from a world map. Depending on the time taken to finish a level and the number of blocks destroyed, the player gets a certain amount of gold, which can be used to buy power-ups (called panels in the game) in shop, which in term is accessed from the map. Power-ups allow, for example, to revive Bomberman when he dies in a stage or to increase the length of an explosion. Before entering a new area, the player chooses which panels to use in order to complete the area. The multiplayer mode are both player vs. player modes. In Panel mode, each player can place only one bomb at a time and the bombs&apos; radius starts at one, but panels appear in the field to improve this. In Powerful mode, no panels appear, but each player can place up to four bombs at a time and the radius is four.</story>

The hero Wilbur Finletter has to travel through eleven side-scrolling levels in order to stop the evil Doctor Gangrene who runs over the town with his killer tomatoes. Basically Finletter moves through the levels, jumps over gaps and avoids the enemies because they have the ability to drain his life energy by touch. Losing enough energy causes the loss of a life. However, he is not defenceless as he can use a kick against the tomatoes. Additionally he can find swords in the levels which can be thrown. Other things to find are lightning bolts (invulnerability for a short time), parachutes and general point suppliers. Finletter also has the ability to use a skateboard. The goal of each level is to find the hidden tomato can and the level end within the time limit. In three instances, there is also a boss fight.</story>

    <story>Bamse, the strongest bear in the world, is a popular Swedish cartoon figure created by Rune Andréasson in 1962. This is his first appearance in a video game. The game was exclusively created for the Swedish market. The story goes, that Skalman has invented a time machine and together with Bamse and Lille Skutt they travel 75 million years back in time to the age of the dinosaurs. But the mischievous Vargen sneaks along and kidnaps Skalman to his doomed castle. Bamse must now free his friend so they can get back to their own time again. Bamse is not an original game. Instead it is a re-skinned version of Baby T-Rex by the same developer. This explains why the settings of the game appears out of context with very little to do with the original cartoon. It also suffers from translation errors and contain left overs from the original game which do not fit in. It is a very traditional platform game where you run and jump to get to the end of the stage. There are a total of 4 worlds, each with 3 stages and a final boss stage. The gameplay is fast paced, with slides and skateboards for added speed. You can find small jars of Dunderhonung and bowling balls to throw at the enemies.

    <story>The East and the West square off for nine innings of hard hitting baseball in Bases Loaded for the Nintendo Game Boy. Experience the action as pitchers battle it out against a lineup of heavy hitters using fast, slow, curving and special pitches. Each player brings their own unique stats and abilities to the game as you work your way through progressively more challenging teams. This portable version of Bases Loaded is loosely based on the title for the original NES. In this scaled down version Major League teams are replaced with two teams representing the East and West Coast Divisions. With two Game Boy units and a Video Link cable players can go head to head - although each player will also need their own game cartridge. Single players can enjoy a quick pickup game by selecting an unofficial game of 1 to 9 innings. An official game will allow a victorious team to move on to consecutive matches against progressively more challenging teams, a feature that substitutes for the traditional &apos;Season Mode&apos; of most baseball titles. But you&apos;ll have to do this in a single sitting as no battery save option was included. Play in USA or Japan mode for a subtle change in the gameplay or learn how to best utilize the strengths of the East and West teams. Pitchers are rated 1 to 5 and batters get a rating for both running speed and hitting ability.</story>

    <story>The Joker lives again in SunSoft&apos;s sequel to their NES original. The Joker has somehow managed to escape from Arkham Asylum once again, and Batman must fight him across seven stages to restore peace to Gotham City. Batman carries a gauntlet shooting basic bullets by default. This can be upgraded with weapon powerups located in boxes throughout the level, giving access to homing and energy weapons. Every upgrade weapon can be charged up for a secondary attack, different for each weapon. Batman also has a slide useful against most enemies and some bosses. Boss fights introduce a system where life is measured by points instead of tick marks or bars. In these sections, Batman has significantly more health, and can take many more hits when rumbling with these stronger foes. Levels include a snowy landscape, moving train, military base, and sewers. Two levels require you to run and dodge explosions while vehicles keep pace in the background. Some levels also have Batman activate a jetpack and play through a short side-scrolling shooter. This game is one of the few Batman games that was not based directly on a movie or television series.</story>

The game features three possible gameplay modes- 1P Game (story mode), Vs. Computer and Vs. Human. The story mode is slightly different from the console version, featuring a different unlockable final boss. As in the console version, battles can be won either by depleting the adversary&apos;s life bar or by tossing him or her out of the ring. Each character has its own special moves and a desperation move (which can only be used when the character has 10% or less of his or her health).</story>

    <story>Battle Bull is an action game in which the player takes the role of an excavator driver who participates in a championship with 48 levels. The goal is simple- driving through the levels and killing a certain amount of other (respawning) drivers. The usual way of achieving this is shoving stones into them. However, only a certain kind of stone can be used this way; the other ones are permanent. The other vehicles have the same ability in addition to the deadly touch. After each round, the player receives money which can be reinvested inside the upgrade shop. The available items are better engines, better shovels, extra lives, the ability to jump and weapons. The latter are obviously an alternate way of reaching the kill ratio.</story>

    <story>This game is much like Zelda II- The Adventure of Link turned into ancient Greece. You play as Orpheus, whose girlfriend, Helene, has been kidnapped by the demonic ruler of the netherworld called Hades. So begins the journey. Just like in Zelda II, there is a top-down map of Greece with towns and other locations to explore. Each of these has side-scrolling sections in which Orpheus fights his way through the minions of Hades. There are various items one must get to continue to the next location, including swords, shields and crystals. There are three fragments of love hidden around; Orpheus has to find them before he can enter Tartarus and fight Hades to save his beloved Helene. The monsters of the game are also based on the Greek mythology and it is pretty entertaining to confront cyclopes, minotaurs and pegasuses.</story>

Pretty much all living things drain the protagonist&apos;s life bar when touched, e.g. pupils or birds, and need to be avoided. Most levels are played from an angled top-down perspective. In those sections the player regularly needs to fetch items for other characters to proceed, e.g. tennis balls. Beavis &amp; Butt-Head have no standard attack and have to collect their weapons (tomatoes and spitballs) in the levels. There are also other power ups to find, e.g. energy refreshments, extra lives or temporary invincibility. The second kind of level consists of standard side-scrolling platforming.</story>

Your four puppies need to be rescued and brought back to their mom. As a responsible father and guardian you&apos;ll first need to find the puppy, avoiding dangers such as bad-tempered cats, mean dogcatchers, acorns which have a habit to drop down just when you pass underneath, and careless skateboarders. You can bark at these opponents to scare them away. And if you&apos;ll find a source of water (such as a rubber hose), you can make yourself wet and then - in a tense situation - shake off the water, eliminating everyone in the vicinity. Once you find your pup, you&apos;ll find out that getting him back to his mom is no easy task. While your puppy can - thankfully - walk on his own accord when you put him down, you&apos;ll still have to carry it over obstacles, and you&apos;ll be forced to fight all the enemies again while doing it.</story>

    <story>Black Bass- Lure Fishing is a Game Boy version of Super Black Bass, however this time there are only two lakes to fish in and only a limited set of lures is available, such as shallow runners, spinner baits, pencil baits, plastic frogs even real life worms. The casting is an overhead view with two meters. One is for the direction, but the view for the lure is a side view where the shadow of the fish can be seen as it approaches. It also shows how deep the lure is and how much line is left before it is reeled in. There are four fish in the game to fish for - trout, pike, catfish and of course the game&apos;s namesake, the black bass.</story>

    <story>Based on the arcade game, Blades Of Steel is a hockey arcade action game (gameplay doesn&apos;t require the need to worry about statistics or provide the ability to customize teams.) Two players can play against each other, or one player against the computer. In one player mode there are single game and tournament mode options. From time to time a fight may break out, which will provide a close up view of the two players. The player has control during the miniature fight game sequence, with the loser having to spend time in the penalty box. The referee will break up fights that go on too long, and calls a few penalties such as icing. Several short clips of digitized voices are also featured.</story>

Once again you must get into your armour and journey to the underground caves in order to discover the truth behind the new menace. Blaster Master Boy is a somewhat direct sequel of Blaster Master, your mission is to control your character through a series of underground dungeons from a top-down perspective and defeat the enemies you encounter there. You no longer have your trusty tank to take with you in side scrolling areas, nor your grenades, but to aid you in the dungeons you now have the ability to carry special bombs which can be used to kill enemies as well as clear paths through the dungeons à la Bomber King.</story>

Other modes of play include Big Boggle, where there are more letters; Categories, where you must find words that are related to a topic; Anagrams, which calls for you to unscramble words; and Use All, in which the goal is to use every letter on the board. Since there is a dictionary that contains 35,000 words, it is unlikely that you will find a word that has not been included. If that happens, you can override the dictionary for such an emergency. You can also challenge your friends to game via a link cable. Now you can test your brain and your spelling skills with Boggle Plus. </story>

Making Jack&apos;s task difficult are numerous enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs. In each round, collecting a number of bombs results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting this coin will make the player&apos;s score increase 2 to 4 times. More often than not, the power ball appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the bombs. There is also the E coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin appear. The more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly to get you.</story>

    <story>This is a Japan only release, not to be confused with the USA release Bomberman GB, which is a different game. In the one player game, you are placed in an arena with a dark Bomberman for a best-two-out-of-three round. You must, using your bombs, blow him up without getting blown up yourself. After you beat him, the process repeats with two Bombermen then three Bombermen. After you beat the three Bombermen in two out of three rounds, you must beat a boss character to move on. When playing the rounds, you can find power-ups to increase the blast size, allow more than one bomb on the screen and, temporarily, make you invincible. When you beat the bosses, you gain things like the ability to kick a bomb away, run faster, ram enemies, etc. In a multi-player game, two to four players do their best to blow each other up. Multi-player is done with the Super Game Boy on a SNES. More than two players is only possible with a multitap. This game was released in the U.S. as Wario Blast, with some changes. The animated opening was removed and, of course, Wario was added.</story>

    <story>Brain Drain is a puzzle game in which the player has to recreate a pattern, consisting of different symbols like apples or hearts, which is shown in the corner of the screen. The main playing field consists of said symbols, but randomly switched around. The player controls a frame which encloses four of the symbols. When pressing a button, the symbols are rotated clockwise around the frame. Of course the levels have to be solved within a time limit. In the higher difficulty levels, the player also has to deal with so-called special effects which occasionally kick in during play, e.g. some symbols get hidden by ? blocks, symbols rotate on their own or the controls are reversed. Three power-ups can be earned by completing bonus levels or finishing a level really fast- clock (stops time for 20 seconds), flash (skips the current level) and credit (gives a second try after time has run out). Clock and flash have to be activated manually; credits is applied automatically. Besides the regular playing mode, there is also the Brain Race available which involves solving a certain number of levels (depending on the difficulty) as fast as possible.</story>

Jonathan Harker can move left and right, jump and attack with a weapon, the most basic of which is a knife. The status display on the screen shows Harker&apos;s health bar, countdown timer to complete the level and currently held weapon. Throughout the levels question mark boxes (similar to the Mario games) can be found, attacking these will reveal power ups which include health restoration, timer increase and new weapons. Among these new weapons are axes, daggers and a shotgun. Question mark boxes can also be used as platforms to reach other areas and enemies. Each stage is divided into two sections- the Daytime and the Nighttime. These are entirely different levels comparable to stage 1-a and 1-b. Harker must jump to various platforms and obstacles and defeat minor enemies throughout the levels. The end of a Nighttime level is usually guarded by a boss creature who must be defeated to progress.</story>

The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave... Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they&apos;ll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</story>

    <story>Bubsy is back! After defeating the evil Woolies in the first game, Bubsy, the brave bob-cat, has to participate in an even more dangerous adventure- to explore a mysterious hyperdimensional mansion, inside of which there are portals that lead to different area in different locations and times. Similarly to Sonic games, Bubsy moves very fast and can also jump very high. Bubsy kills the enemies by jumping on their heads. The levels are large and can be accessed right from the beginning of the game (except the ultimate level), starting in either west or east wing. There are five types of regular levels- Egyptian pyramid, sci-fi space-like environment, a world filled with musical instruments and notes, a green level with trees and hills, and a side-scrolling group of levels where Bubsy has to navigate an airplane.</story>

Most levels are side- and vertical-scrolling with pre-designed layouts. A few levels are different, though- top-down perspective, with a randomized layout. Either way, the player is armed with a variety of weapons, including different guns (laser, missile, ring) and the powerful cobalt bomb which kills everything on screen. Burai Fighter Deluxe is identical to the NES version of Burai Fighter. The Deluxe part refers to the added versus multiplayer mode through the link cable functionality that is included with this Game Boy release.</story>

Only the arcade mode (a port of the original arcade version with the main singleplayer campaign or the possibility to challenge an AI opponent) and the challenge mode (beating a series of 25 levels as fast as possible) are available. Regarding gameplay, this is a tile matching game. There are bubbles of varying shades at the top of the screen and the player controls a stationary cannon at the bottom of the screen. The cannon is loaded with one bubble at the time and the direction of the shot can be varied left and right. The goal is to clear the screen by matching bubbles of the same colour.</story>

    <story>Buster Bros. is a platform game which consists of 50 levels in total. It can be played with one or two players on the same screen, and the other player can join anytime within the game. Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they&apos;re at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump. You can also pick up power-ups such as- the ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that attaches to the ceiling and waits &apos;til something bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire but cannot destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, you can also pick certain things like clock (halting time for a small period), dynamite (reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making you able to reach more points), life, and such.</story>

    <story>Casper is a mini games collection based on the 1995 movie of the same name. Casper is a ghost with three evil uncles, who have turned the dad of Casper&apos;s human friend Kat into ectoplasm. The goal is to bring him back to the living. There are six different mini games- •Protect the Ooze- The player has to protect the Ooze containers stationed at the bottom of the screen. Casper&apos;s uncles come flying from the top of the screen and have to be shot with the crosshair before they can damage the containers. The game ends after a certain amount of time has passed. •Ooze Runner- There are four floors which can be reached by climbing ladders. On each floor is an Ooze container which needs to be collected. However, the uncles patrol the floors and their touch needs to be avoided. After enough Ooze has been collected, a flag appears on the top level which needs to be touched to end the level. This has to be accomplished within a time limit. •Return the Books- One of the uncles drops books from the top of the screen and the goal is to prevent them from falling on the floor. Casper can transform into a trampoline which is used to bounce the book to a collecting container on the left of the screen. Occasionally Ooze vials will appear which need to be collected in order to win the mini game. •Puzzles- Here the player has to construct a machine, e.g. one which automatically cooks breakfast, by switching a few items into the correct order. •The Up and At &apos;Em Machine- Casper has to push Kat, who is sitting in a mining cart, left and right in order to avoid chains and ghosts. •Casper Says- A simple Simon Says variant. In order to complete the game, the first four mini games have to completed three times with increasing difficulty, after which the fifth and sixth come into play. After completing those two, the player will face the last challenge- a final Ooze Runner game. </story>

    <story>You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their presence is somehow poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up. You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment. The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect. Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-&apos;em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.</story>

The player&apos;s goal is to topple the opponents king. A player controls a small army (with units like orcman, karate man, warrior etc) on a small chess board. If two pieces meet on the same square, they fight on special screen with a playing-card roulette. Depending on the cards that each unit gets they will do damage to an opponent. Different units have different health points and also different cards, for example, some units have more propensity to getting the instantly killing joker card. Some units are able to cast attack or defense spells. When these pieces move to an empty square on the map a spell window will open. Each spell can either damage surrounding squares or heal/revive surrounding units. </story>

    <story>Catrap is a single screen puzzle game with 100 rounds. You and your sister (or girlfriend?) have somehow been turned into cat-humans and you&apos;re are trapped in a castle full of baddies. The gameplay is best described as a mix between Boulder Dash and Soko-Ban. The goal is to clear each screen of bad guys, in 100 increasingly difficult rounds. You can punch a bad guy by walking onto it from the left or right. You can&apos;t attack from above or below, but you can stand on top of a monster, or underneath a monster. Other elements to make the game more interesting are loose ground which you can stand on or dig through, ladders to climb and boulders you can push around. You can choose to play each round as a boy or a girl, but this doesn&apos;t affect gameplay, only the background music. In some rounds, both the boy and the girl are present at the same time. You can then switch between them with select-button, using both of them in clever ways to solve the rounds. During the game, you can rewind to undo certain moves. You can play the rounds in any order, so you can skip to more difficult ones and solve them at a later time. There is a round editor to create your own puzzles, but these self made rounds can&apos;t be saved.</story>

    <story>As an undercover agent of Chase Headquarters, your job is to patrol the streets and track down five criminals. You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal&apos;s car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can&apos;t afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. However, once you&apos;ve caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a suspicion.</story>

However, the plane is actually loaded with terrorists who hijacked a large shipment of cash. The game consists of side-scrolling action. The hero can walk, run, jump, punch, and kick while jumping. Further, he can perform special feats as the situation requires, such as crossing a rope suspended from 2 cliffs. One of the biggest threats in this game is nature as Gabe must defend against wolves and birds, snow falling off cliffs and structures, and falling rocks.</story>

The goal of each one-screen level (the background themes progress from the big bang all the way to the future) is simple- bouncing between platforms, collecting as many points as possible and above all the exit key which opens up the way to the next level. Of course there are various hazards to overcome, mostly in the form of special platforms like sticky or angled ones. There are also other tools to collect which can be used to make life easier at other places- water drops for extinguishing fires, a hammer for destroying walls and keys for opening up passages.</story>

    <story>A mouse-driven game in which the player controls a small, circular spaceship which must travel around the screen collecting crystals. This task is made more difficult by the aliens which constantly swarm out from the portals on both sides of the screen. These can be shot down by the ship&apos;s gun (which has unlimited ammo) or eliminated by activating one of the player&apos;s limited supply of smart bombs, which will clear the screen of all current enemies. The physics of the game were quite unusual for the time; the ship does not simply follow the mouse&apos;s movement like a mouse cursor. Rather, it retains its inertia, and must be carefully guided around so it does not crash into anything. Bullets, when fired, travel in the direction of the ship&apos;s movement, requiring the player to actually travel toward enemies in order to shoot them down. This was the first color game for the Macintosh, although it was business-as-usual for the IIgs.</story>

    <story>Darkwing Duck is a 2D 3rd person platform game featuring this Disney super-hero, friend of Lauchpad McQuack (the Duck Tales character who worked as a pilot for Scrooge McDuck). As a decent super-hero, his role is to save the city from his enemies. Graphics are cartoonish, like other Disney licenses developed by Capcom, but darker. Gameplay is similar to Mega Man and Duck Tales, in the same jump and run style. Controls are easy to handle.</story>

Your goal, of course, is to rescue the Princess Blobette from a large castle. In order to do so, the Boy must use the Blob to get past the castle&apos;s many obstacles. The Blob is an extremely useful creature. By feeding it jelly beans, it will turn into useful things like a trampoline, ladder, or key.</story>

    <story>Tom Cruise&apos;s film brought NASCAR racing to the masses, and Mindscape did the same for games players with this license. If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. You play Cruise&apos;s Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied. This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves. From times to times you&apos;ll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you loose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit. The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.</story>

The player chooses between three cars (dune buggy, sand rail or off-road truck) and races against the clock while dodging obstacles like other cars or blockades. The ten courses, which have to be unlocked in a linear order, take place in a tube and are shown in a cross-sectional view from above. The cars can move left and right on the bend. Other than that there are also a few power-ups to collect on the way which bring advantages like a nitro boost.</story>

    <story>Dexterity is a puzzle game with a 7x8 grid, each one filled with a tile or another item. The goal is to flip over all tiles within a time limit. This has to be triggered manually by pressing a button, but if there is another flipped tile on the field, all other tiles between the player&apos;s position and the other tile will flip, too. Some grids are filled with stationary blocks, moveable blocks (either pushing them normally or send them flying with a strong kick) and holes. There are also monsters which need to be avoided. All five of them have different behaviour patterns and have the ability to reverse already flipped tiles; some of them can even push blocks or destroy tiles. The monsters can be killed by using blocks against them- pushing them over the borders of the playfield or a hole will kill them. Alternatively they also can be trapped. Killed monsters slowly respawn at pre-defined spawn points; this takes place over several phases. In the egg phase, it can be picked up to kill another enemy with it. Another possible weapon are stunned enemies which stood on a multi-flipped row. When pushing blocks into a corner, they will disappear and transform into power ups, e.g. bonus points, extra time or a temporary stun of all enemies. A life is lost when an enemy is touched or the time runs out. When that happens, all flipped tiles stay flipped.</story>

Some sections involve negotiating platforms and window sills far above the street, while others involve walking at street level while dodging safes that criminals attempt to drop on you from windows. In all cases, Dick can pummel enemies into submission with his fists or find and use a hand gun, tommy gun or tear gas. The weapons all have very limited ammunition.</story>

Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</story>

Frustrated at this, she decides to take Kiddy with her and find The Lost World before everyone else! As with Donkey Kong Country 3- Dixie Kong&apos;s Double Trouble!, Dixie Kong takes the lead in the third chapter of the Donkey Kong Land series. Dixie can glide using her hair, and carries barrels over her head. Her partner is the heavy Kiddy, who carries barrels in front of him, and can jump a bit further by somersaulting over platform edges first. There are also special animal friends that can help the two primates out. Ellie the Elephant can shoot water at enemies, while Enguarde the Swordfish can glide through water with ease. Squawks the Parrot can fly and spit eggs, and Squitter the Spider can shoot webbing as well as use it to create new platforms. Each level has Bonus Coins and DK Coins tucked well away in the levels. While it&apos;s possible to gain an ending without these, to complete the game properly, players must seek them all out and unlock levels of the fabled &apos;Lost World&apos;. A new feature to the game series is a Time Attack mode - once players finish the game, they can attempt to beat the best time for certain levels.</story>

    <story>The Game Boy version for Dragon&apos;s Lair is actually a port of Roller Coaster, with its protagonist replaced by Dirk the Daring. Dirk must collect all lifestones scattered all around the game world (by walking or jumping) to finally save Princess Daphne. The game world is divided in several screens which can be freely navigated and are a little wider than Game Boy&apos;s screen. As Dirk moves the screen will scroll and when its limit is reached, it will flick to a new one. To help him move around, Dirk can jump over bumper cars, flying magic hats and other kinds of moving platforms. Dirk starts with 10 lives which can be lost by falling from high platforms, touching spikes or landing on water or fire. The main theme is somewhat reminiscent from the NES version. The game can be played in two different speeds and can also be played by two players taking turns.</story>

The game, originally written for the 8-bit Ataris, is basically a Defender clone, but popular because it so closely recreates the gameplay of the original Defender, with its speedy scrolling and frantic gameplay. The player is a spaceman with a jet-pack, flying across a barren landscape whose skies are inhabited by a number of different aliens; from the simple Planter to the slowly advancing Blunder Storm or the quick, aggressive Nemesite. Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. You must shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety. This is the Dropzone.</story>

When they show it to Uncle Scrooge, he recognizes it as part of his great, great Uncle Fergus McDuck&apos;s legendary treasure map! With the remaining parts of the map hidden around the world, it&apos;s up to Uncle Scrooge to find them and discover Fergus McDuck&apos;s secret treasure! Duck Tales 2 is the sequel to the NES and Game Boy game, Duck Tales. Based on the Disney cartoon of the same name, players control Uncle Scrooge as he searches the globe for massive amounts of wealth while trying to discover hidden pieces of the map. Scrooge&apos;s main method of attack is his cane - by jumping in the air and holding the B Button, the cane turns into a pogo stick, allowing players to jump onto most enemies&apos; heads and cross dangerous terrain like spikes with ease. By pushing up against a wall or an object, Scrooge will whack his cane like a golf club, either sending the object flying or occasionally revealing secret items. New to Duck Tales 2 is the ability to push and pull certain objects with the cane after hitting them. Familiar faces such as Huey, Dewey and Louie, Webby, Mrs. Beakley, and Launchpad McQuack all turn up to lend a hand. Scrooge will even bump into the crazy inventor, Gyro Gearloose, who will improve Scrooge&apos;s cane so that he can access even more secret areas.</story>

    <story>You are Agent 17 (codename- Otto). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building. Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission- execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them- 1. Shooting them with his gun. 2. Kicking them by jumping onto them. 3. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them. 4. Crushing them with an elevator. Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark. While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he&apos;s already in an elevator if a bullet&apos;s trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn&apos;t mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don&apos;t have time to jump. Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building. If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn&apos;t go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It&apos;s virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.</story>

    <story>F1 Pole Position is a Formula One racing video game released for the Game Boy by Ubisoft. The game is originally known in Japan as Nakajima Satoru Kanshū F-1 Hero GB &apos;92- The Graded Driver which is the sequel to Nakajima Satoru Kanshū F-1 Hero GB. In comparison to its prequel, the game has a more realistic approach due to the licensing by Foca to Fuji Television. Modes available are the usual- grand prix, warming up (or training), multi game (or multi player), and options. Some other changes (or improvements if possible) in relation to its predecessor- the more detailed background and tracks. Also, making the turns without getting off the track is much more easier due to a better view (even though the track map is still not displayed on the screen). During the qualifying and races, retire will appear if the player crashes too much, or simply want to stop racing. In the Japanese version, before every race, Satoru Nakajima will give some tips about certain areas of the circuit, while this feature was removed from the Western version. One other difference is that Ayrton Senna is included in the Japanese version, while Michael Andretti replaces Senna in the Western one. In both versions the player has to compete in two full seasons. The rounds are basically split into different parts, in each one a minimum goal must be achieved (to qualify and finish the race x number of times) so that the contract is renewed. If the player fails, the game over screen will pop out.</story>

    <story>Felix The Cat is a platformer based on the famous cartoon character. The Professor has kidnapped Kitty, Felix girlfriend, trying to exchange her for Felix&apos; magic bag. Naturally, Felix is not going to let himself be blackmailed, and instead sets out to free Kitty. There are four different types of levels. 1. Typical platforming levels in which Felix has to make his way to the exit while jumping about obstacles and chasms, killing enemies using different weapons. Swimming levels in which Felix rides a float or on the back of a dolphin. Levels that take place entirely under water. Flying levels that put Felix in control of different flying devices, such as a plane, a hot-air balloon or an umbrella. Throughout all levels, Felix can collect cat symbols to improve his weapons. After collecting a certain number of cat symbols, milk bottles or hearts will appear. Hearts improve Felix&apos; current weapon. What types of weapon Felix can use, depends on what type of level he is in. There are lots of different weapons ranging from a boxing glove to motorcycles to tanks to spaceships. All weapons that are better than the standard weapon have an energy bar that diminishes over time and can be refilled by collecting milk bottles. Getting hit by an enemy decreases the level of Felix&apos; current weapon. If he gets hit while carrying the standard weapon, he loses a life. The Game Boy version plays virtually identically to the NES version, but features less levels.</story>

    <story>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football&apos;s world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as isometric) viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games. Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set- fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</story>

    <story>The late-1997 edition of FIFA was heavily tied in with the qualifying procedure for the 1998 World Cup. In the Road to the World Cup mode, you take a team from first qualification through to the main tournament, using the varying systems in different parts of the world. The game features 16 distinct outdoor stadia. The League play features 189 clubs and 11 leagues. Each team has specific crowd chants incorporated into the ambient sound. The action is faster than in previous versions, and AI has been expanded. Players have distinct facial feature and hair styles. Each match is introduced by Des Lynam and commentated on by John Motson and former Scotland international Andy Gray.</story>

    <story>The handheld version of FIFA Soccer 96 has a few differences in comparison to its brethren on the big systems. There are only eight national leagues instead of eleven, there is no practise mode, saving or team editor, and it does not have the license to use real team and athlete names. Of course there are also the expected technical differences regarding graphic, sounds and controls. Besides those changes, it is still a traditional soccer game. The player has the choice between 217 teams (59 national teams) and several playing modes- friendly matches, national leagues, a league with national teams, tournaments or playoffs. There are a variety of options to set, including the difficulty level, weather or if athletes can be injured. There is also an overall option if the gameplay is more action or simulation oriented. The matches itself are shown from an isometric perspective and the athletes are directly controlled.</story>

    <story>The second in the Final Fantasy Legend series increases the amount of detail over the original in gameplay and graphics. The major changes are in the character classes and party members. Similar to FFL, starting a game of Legends II allows you to choose your main character from Humans, Monsters, Mutants and a new class- Robots. From here, you build your party of 4 from the same character classes. During gameplay special side-characters will join you in battle to help defeat certain enemies. The other improvement is in strategy. In FFL you gain experience points after each battle, increasing strength, etc. In FFLII, you gain different points and abilities depending on how you defeated the enemy. If you win by using a sword, your strength increases. If you use magic, your mana increases. This adds a more strategic approach to defeating enemies.</story>

    <story>The final (no joke) Final Fantasy Legend title to grace the Game Boy, FFLIII tells the story of a great flood which destroys cities in the past, present and future. As you control a party of 4, with a choice of human and mutant classes, and travel back and forth through time collecting pieces of the great ship Talon so as to defeat the enemy that has flooded the lands. The inclusion of a time travel storyline means that whatever you do in one time frame can have an affect on what happens in another time. Other major changes compared to the original 2 in the series are the ability to mutate your characters further and a change to the upgrade system. Items picked up after battle can be attached to your mutants or humans to turn them into monsters or robots, increasing your parties power and abilities. And although the original system of obtaning experience points after every battle has been removed, its replacement allows you to choose which magic stone each character can use, so they learn that specific magic type and never lose it.</story>

    <story>In The Flintstones- King Rock Treasure Island, Fred Flintstone finds a treasure map during work. In order to find said treasure, he needs to solve seven levels, some ending with a boss battle. These are traditional side-scrolling platform levels in which Fred has to jump over gaps and dodge enemies. His weapon of choice are axes which he throws at an angle. However, hitting an enemy does not kill them instantly but stuns them; a state where they can be abused as stepping stone. Hitting them while they are stunned kills them, but they respawn when Fred walks back to their starting location or at special skulls - those are mostly placed at sections where Fred can&apos;t progress without an artificial staircase. Of course there are also power ups to collect- most of them only increase the points counter or refresh the life energy, but one allows Fred to ride his pet dinosaur Dino. This allows him to throw axes straight and jump higher, but Dino is lost when hit once.</story>

The player&apos;s task is to recreate the original picture by sliding the tiles around one at a time. This variant of the concept adds special items that appear on the tiles for brief moments. They are activated when the tiles they are on are moved around. Among these are a bomb which if not moved within ten seconds of its appearance will detonate and lead to a game over. There is also a lock and key combo where the locked tile is unmovable until the tile with the key has been activated. Other items include one that reshuffles some of the tiles, one that gives extra time and one that auto completes the current puzzle. There are two different game types- normal game and against the clock. Both are on time but the latter is played without any of the special items. There are also four different difficulty level that can be chosen before a game. </story>

The compilation consists of four popular titles from the Game &amp; Watch Series, each with a Classic and Modern version of each game- 1. Octopus- Collects as much treasure as your bag can hold, while avoiding the octopus tentacles that continually swing around you. In the Modern version, Mario becomes the diver, and as he collects more treasure, his bag becomes heavier, making it harder to return to the surface. Mario can also delay the octopus tentacles by throwing treasure at them. Fire- Position your net to catch the falling people jumping from the burning building. The Modern version has Mario and Luigi rescuing Toad, Yoshi and Donkey Kong Jr. from Princess Peach&apos;s Castle. Each falling character has different weights and falling patterns. Manhole- The player must cover the holes to keep the continually walking people from falling through the manholes and into the sewers. In the Modern version, Yoshi must use his tongue to keep Mario, Toad and Donkey Kong Jr. from falling thought the hole, each character having different speeds and patterns. Oil Panic- The player must collect the dripping blobs of oil before they slip past and ruin everything. The Modern version has Bowser dropping oil blobs at Mario, who has to catch the oil and dump it over to Yoshi before the Koopa King gets the best of Mario. Each mode (Classic and Modern) has two difficulties- Easy and Hard. The higher score a player gets in each version, new unlockable bonuses will become available via the Gallery Corner. These bonuses include release dates, pictures and animations which tell in greater detail the history behind Gunpei Yokoi&apos;s portable creations.</story>

    <story>This strategic action puzzle game features original gameplay. You control a spacecraft situated on a globe which you can rotate and move around the screen. You must knock globes into others of the same colour, to rid the screen of all the globes. The screen has no borders, so globes can be pushed off the side of the screen, increasing your tactical range. Knocking globes of different colors into each other produces smaller pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving you energy, or they will turn into globes and you will have to get rid of them too. Many of the globes are linked to other globes (or the ship) via string, and the level layouts include barriers as obstacles (and ricochet points), making the Newtonian physics more complex.</story>

    <story>The Real Ghostbusters, known as Garfield Labyrinth in Europe and Mickey Mouse IV- Mahou no Labyrinth in Japan, is a puzzle/platform game. The story is very simple- Venkman (or Garfield and Odie or Mickey and Mini Mouse, depending on the version you play) walk over a bridge one day, a tile breaks loose and Venkman/Garfield/Mickey falls down a deep pit, which ends up in a bizarre labyrinth, which Venkman/Garfield/Mickey must escape. There&apos;s no other goal apart from that, the player just needs to find the exit in each level. Apart from getting there, the exit must also be unlocked. For the latter, the player must collect all gems in the level. Each level contains various traps and enemies which need to be avoided. The puzzles involve finding keys to lower bridges or open doors, make use of teleporters and especially- drilling away blocks. Conveniently, the player finds a pneumatic hammer at the beginning of the game, which must be used to create paths to certain areas and items, without blocking the way forth or back. There&apos;s also an inventory to store items like keys and bombs (used to kill enemies). The protagonist has a health bar and can take several hits before losing a life, but there is also a time limit for each level. The game features a password system, a password is given automatically after completing a level. In spite of the differences in main character and a minor variation in the short intro cinematic all regional versions are identical.</story>

    <story>This top-down puzzle game starts with a screen featuring a number of red cogs at different parts of the screen, and a grid of pegs (which become less complete on later levels). Your task on each level is to use a number of gears of one of 3 different sizes to ensure that all the pegs are linked together. All this has to be completed before the engine overheats. Making life harder are two creatures with the peculiar name ‘Poffins’. One of these goes around removing pegs, and the other causes the engine to overheat further. They can be shot out of the way, or have gears placed over them to stop them. There’s also a bonus round, which is a fruit machine, only with cogs and other things from the game rather than fruit. </story>

    <story>Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, this is a boxing simulation where players, taking the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve rounds against different boxers to win the championship title belt. Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown. By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored. All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress.</story>

    <story>Loosely based on the movie of the same name, Ghostbusters II sees Virgo the Carpathian appear in New York city. He captures Diana&apos;s baby and it is up to the Ghostbusters to get him back. In order to accomplish this, the Ghostbusters- Igon, Ray, Peter and Winston, must chase Virgo through the courtrooms, the sewers, the apartments, the underground and the art museum. Ghostbusters II is a top-view action game based off of New Ghostbusters II (the second Ghostbusters II license on NES) but with enough differences to be unique. Players begin by choosing two of the four ghostbusters, who all play the exact same. The first one selected is controlled by the player directly and carries a proton pack, the second ghostbuster is follows the first and carries the ghost trap. The objective of each level is to capture a predefined number of ghosts before the timer expires. The player moves up, down, left and right. One button will fire the proton gun directly in front of the first ghostbuster, stunning any ghosts. The second button will toss the trap directly in front of the second ghostbuster, trapping any stunned ghosts. While exploring the levels, any of the 2 remaining ghostbusters (as well as the ghostbusters&apos; accountant Louis) not currently being used will occasionally show up. Touching them will provide power-ups (and often swap with a selected Ghostbuster) including vacuum guns, instant traps and invulnerability.</story>

    <story>A peaceful nation has been invaded by an enemy army, and you must help clear the way for your own forces by plane. You must guide your tank to the end of each stage by arranging boxes with a hook attached to the bottom of your plane, as well as by shooting enemy planes and batteries that threaten it. The tank will roll forward on its own and climb up any wall that is only a single block high -- anything taller and it will crash into it and turn around, taking damage. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed and the game is over. If you get hit, you lose a plane, and if you run out of planes, the game will also be over. There are several special items to help you on your way, including a power hook that allows you to directly carry the tank, a bomb that can destroy all enemies on the screen, and an option that makes a second plan follow yours and mimic your actions. The game features ten stages, as well as a 2-player cooperative mode (two planes) when played via link cable.</story>

This new dimension you find yourself in is not terribly unlike the one you came from, with the exception that everyone is named after foods or food-related items and most of the monsters appear to be mutated vegetables and the like. This RPG breaks from the normal formula in a few respects. The battle system does not use any menus, switching all commands to simple button pushes. A being attack, B for dodge, Start will run and the D-Pad is shortcuts to certain spells. The combat is also live, in the sense that if you take too long to complete your turn, your opponent will attack again. Using a battery-backed save system, the game will automatically auto-save after every successful battle.</story>

He has to defeat an army of ghosts in a series of environments, including construction site, sewer, airship, jungle, and finally, the headquarters where he meets the evil ghost building machine. Rather than using his mallet, Harry can obtain a spiked ball which does more damage than the mallet. There are five stages, and each one ends with Harry fighting a boss. Upon completion of a stage, the gameplay switches from a beat-em-up to a horizontal shooter where Harry flies through the air, defeating airborne enemies and avoiding dangerous objects.</story>

    <story>Harvest Moon is a farming simulator/RPG where you must build and maintain a farm during the course of a year, while taking care of your budget and yourself. You have the ability to buy, sell and take care of farm animals, crops and any other supplies that you may have. You can trade with many of the town&apos;s people, and fellow farmers. If you link up a friend&apos;s Game Boy, you can trade items between players as well. The local stores supply plenty of items to help you in your quest, at a cost, of course. And if you have the time, you can go about the town in search of a little fun away from work. From an overhead perspective, you can explore your farming area, the local town and the Harvest Sprite tunnels, full of strange and wonderful creatures that can help or destroy your quest. There are four seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) and each brings with it new challenges such as keeping arm animals warm during the colder seasons, and supplying water to the crops during the warmer periods. The GBC version includes all new characters and background sprites in full color, but is also backwards compatible with the original Game Boy version.</story>

    <story>In Hatris, the falling blocks of Tetris are replaced by falling hats which are top hats, cowboy hats, baseball caps, derbys, party hats and crowns. The setting is a hat factory, where hats are dropped down from a conveyor belt two at a time and must be stacked on one of six mannequin heads. Once five hats of the same kind have been stacked on top of each other, they fall down onto another conveyor belt below and are shipped out of the factory, rewarding the player with a cash bonus. (The game keeps track of score as money, not simply points.) Once you ship out enough hats out of the shop, you go up a level to the next shop. The higher shop number you get to, the more types of hats start appearing to make it more difficult for you to accomplish your task. The game ends when one of your stacks of hats reaches the top of the screen.</story>

The game starts with a maze where the kebiishi and some aliens appear. The aliens start moving through the maze wherever they please. While trying to keep from getting eaten, the kebiishi digs holes where the aliens will likely travel. If an alien comes to a finished hole, it will fall in an be trapped for a while. While the alien is trapped in the hole, you can fill the hole to bury it. If all aliens are buried, the round ends and you can proceed to the next round. The credits say original concept by TSG, copyright 1979. The Game Boy version includes new original features such as a super alien that has special powers, moves to avoid holes and chases the keibiishi.

    <story>Hit the Ice is a fast-paced, high-impact hockey game based on the 1990 arcade game from Williams. Having more in common with Midway&apos;s Arch Rivals than any sane hockey simulation, this arena is no place for penalties, and no place for wimps. While the idea is still to somehow put the puck into the opposing team&apos;s goal, each team only has three players, there is a heavy focus on checking, and it is possible to do a super shot which is strong enough to send the goalie into the net along with the puck. Available are exhibition and tournament modes for one or two players. Two players can even team up to take on the computer. The TurboGrafx-16 release also adds a four-player mode, while the Gameboy version adds a shot race mode where the player must get a certain number of goals as quickly as possible.</story>

The goal is always to both survive and collect as many money bags as possible. The amount of required bags to beat a level depends on the chosen difficulty level. •Underwater snorkeling- Hugo camera is fixed behind Hugo&apos;s back and he has to dodge incoming obstacles. He also needs to regularly take new breath which is only possible if he stays in the middle of the screen. •Snowboarding- Just like in the underwater level, Hugo has to dodge incoming obstacles; just on a snowboard. •Forest- Hugo automatically moves from left to right and has to dodge obstacles by either jumping or ducking. •Ice cave- Here Hugo moves over a bottomless pit. The only way to stay alive is to stand on pillars, but those randomly rise and fall. Hugo can move in four directions. •The fifth level is unlocked after beating the other four. </story>

The mini games are- •Chiseler- A Breakout variant •Djali Bowling- A bowling variant with a two-click system- the position of the bowling goat and the speed by clicking the button with the correct timing while the goat respectively an arrow automatically move back and forth - the position when the button is pressed determines the result. The player also has to choose if the throw is straight or with a drift. •Catch the Fool- The player is in charge of a rescue net and can move left and right. People are thrown out of the window and the player has to move into position in order to rescue them. •Upsy Daisy- Two participants are floating because they have a bundle of balloons in their hands. The goal is to destroy all of the opponent&apos;s balloons. •Picture Puzzle- A standard sliding block puzzle. •Wheel of Fortune- This game has to be unlocked with good results in the other mini games.

This war machine has been named the Red October. While on its trial run, the captain, Marko Ramius has hijacked the submarine along with it&apos;s crew. They plan to defect to the United States. Naturally, such a weapon must not be allowed to fall into American plans, and so orders are issued among the Soviet forces to destroy the Red October. You control the Red October during its run for freedom. The game plays as an underwater sidescroller. The Red October submarine can move in any of four directions. The A button fires torpedoes horizontally towards the right and the B button fires missiles vertically, upwards. Additionally, the Caterpillar drive (invisibility) may be activated for short periods of time. The player may also activate a ECM blast that will destroy all nearby offensive weapons. On the screen at all times are displays for Armor (health) and Power (fuel); should either run low, the Red October in danger of being destroyed.

    <story>At a time when computer games were being blamed for violence, bad language, epilepsy and everything else the ‘moral majority’ needed a scapegoat for, Virgin gave us- The Road Safety Game. Or not, as this is a standard platform game with a twist of questionable taste and purpose. You play a crash test dummy, trying to progress through levels filled with hazards such as cars and fireballs, within the time limits. Contact with each of these loses you a limb, and once you have none left, contact means game over. Since the character isn’t handicapped by missing limbs in any way, in practical terms you can think of these as hit points especially as there are screwdrivers to pick up which restore one limb.</story>

    <story>As in the movie (and the more famous graphic adventure), your task is to find the Holy Grail. Before this can be done you must find the Cross of Coronado, a shield and a diary. This makes for a four-level arcade adventure combining climbs, exploration (with several routes through each level, and some traps) and puzzles. Indy is armed with his trusty whip to fight off foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand combat. The first level takes place in caves underneath Colorado, before you reach a moving circus train strewn with traps, a Zeppelin which is full of guards and ladders, and then Castle Grunwald in Austria.</story>

There are ways to play that can dramatically increase the score, which makes the game very strategic in nature. Additionally, when desired, the player can get an oracle reading by asking a question...the question is answered when the player makes a very elegant play (4 way match). There is also a construction set where players can create their own tiles and backgrounds. But the game comes with numerous tile sets and backgrounds.</story>

Four courses are available- Jack&apos;s Greatest, Castle Pines and Desert Mountain as previously seen in Greatest 18 Holes and Muirfield Village from Unlimited. Gameplay modes are skins (for two to four players) and stroke play (for one to four players). Players can choose their golfer&apos;s gender and select from beginner and expert skill levels and different tee modes (professional, men&apos;s and women&apos;s). Besides playing the complete course, there are also practice options for a single hole, the green, and a driving range. Playing a hole begins with a top-down overview of the hole, followed by the standard view from behind the golfer. Strokes are done with the standard three-click method- start, power, and accuracy. During play, it is possible to pull up the hole overview, look at the score card and statistics and change the weather conditions. The game also offers replays and mulligans.</story>

The gameplay mechanics are the same, though- the blob has the standard abilities to jump and punch enemies. Collecting power-ups transform him into other forms with different abilities, e.g. a balloon which allows him to float. Other collectibles are music notes (those are lost after being hit by an enemy; without any notes this results in death) and fruit which eventually reward an extra life. The game features six worlds with eight levels each; every level has to be completed within a time limit.</story>

The solution must be spelled out via cursor input within 60 seconds. If the solution is incorrect, the other player has the chance to try. Daily Double fields (for wagering any amount of money) are also present, as are the Double Jeopardy and Final Jeopardy rounds.

The game was a multi system release so it fits the standard console jump/shoot/duck formula although it does add some unique twists such as wounding enemies so that they surrender and can be arrested. The initial levels follow the plot of the movie with futuristic lawman Judge Dredd framed and sent to the Aspen penal colony from which he must escape and prove his innocence. Following the fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty that ended the film, the game continues on with levels and characters inspired by the comic book culminating with a battle against the Dark Judges on Deadworld.</story>

Your goal is to find the human village so you may you join your kin once again. Mowgli is an athletic individual, and can jump, run, swing on vines or climb them without any problems. Most of the animals he comes upon, however, are inexplicably hostile, so he must defend himself with a variety of thrown weapons, such as bananas and boomerangs. To complete each level, Mowgli must collect a number of crystals (how many - it depends on the difficulty levels) within a time limit.

    <story>One of many different titles based on Steven Spielberg&apos;s 1993 dinosaur thriller, the version for NES and Game Boy is a top-down action game with exploration elements. Playing as Dr. Alan Grant, the player must work through six levels by completing certain objectives including rescuing the kids Tim and Lex, restoring power, destroying Raptor nests and finally getting off the dinosaur-infested island. To advance in a level, a number of dinosaur eggs scattered over the area must be collected or destroyed. This will reveal a passcard used to gain entry to buildings, or some other items necessary to complete the assignment. The park&apos;s computer terminals can be used to request hints on where to go next. Naturally, the levels are full of hostile dinosaurs. Dr. Grant can fend them off with his gun. Several ammunition types are available, varying in damage and shooting patterns. Killed dinosaurs will always drop the most basic ammo type, the others must be found. Next to ammo clips, there are boxes with question marks on them to be collected. These might include beneficial powerups like a health increase, but can also be dangerous and reveal a bomb. Some levels end in boss encounters, including a Triceratops stampede and a fight against the Tyrannosaurus Rex.</story>

    <story>In the distant future, a monopolistic and technological corporation called Ultratech organizes a fighting tournament known as Killer Instinct. Many fighters answer the challenge to participate, including several of Ultratech&apos;s experimental warriors. To increase the tournament&apos;s challenge, Ultratech utilizes a technology that can create bridges between alternate dimensions, releasing a creature known as Eyedol. Eyedol is a two-headed ancient warrior that was imprisoned along with his bitter rival, Gargos. Some warriors enter the tournament to seek glory or escape. Other fighters are attempting to bring an end to Ultratech&apos;s corruption. Killer Instinct is a Rare developed fighting game published by Nintendo (and distributed in the arcades by Midway). Killer Instinct (or KI among its fanbase) is a 2D fighting game that features 3D rendered sprite based graphics. Players choose from 10 characters- Orchid, Cinder, Jago, Glacius, Fulgore, Riptor, Sabrewulf, Spinal, T.J. Combo, and Thunder. Killer Instinct is known for its heavy combo based fighting system, allowing players to pull off moves that land an insane number of hits on their opponent, the highest being the Ultra Combo. The gameplay is also known for its use of combo breakers, finishing moves and stage fatalities, double energy bars, and dance-music inspired techno soundtrack.</story>

Once again, fighters from all over the world receive a mysterious invitation to a team-based fighting tournament. And just like last year, it appears that the notorious criminal Rugal Bernstein is behind it, apparently returning from the dead to raise havok once again... The King of Fighters &apos;95 introduces Kyo Kusanagi&apos;s rival Iori Yagami, and firmly places Kyo as the main character for the rest of the series. The gameplay of The King of Fighters &apos;95 is essentially unchanged from the previous title, though it does introduce the team edit concept which would remain as a standard feature of the series. Using the team edit feature, it is possible to create a totally customized team using any of the available fighters, or use one of the default teams if you wish.</story>

    <story>Jeopardy! is a conversion of the TV quiz show, the first of several versions released for the Game Boy. It features an accurate representation of the game&apos;s rules and a reservoir of more than 1500 answers and questions in around 300 categories. The game is for one or two players (either on one Game Boy or via link cable). After the players enter their names, they are assigned a random character drawn in a cartoon style. Gameplay follows the show&apos;s rules- one player selects the category and difficulty and both can then buzz in within ten seconds to attempt to ask the right question for the answer given. The solution must be spelled out via cursor input within 60 seconds. If the solution is incorrect, the other player has the chance to try. Daily Double fields (for wagering any amount of money) are also present, as are the Double Jeopardy and Final Jeopardy rounds. The answer categories include history, geography, arts, sciences, politics, pop culture, and more, most with a heavy US focus.Different from the NES game of the same name. In the game the player takes on the role of the legendary Prince Valiant licensed from the cartoon series of the same name which is in turn based on the comic series Prince Valiant. Prince Valiant must lead Arthur&apos;s armies against the Tyrant Cynan. The goal is to capture all his castles or defeat all his armies. A giant over-map shows the world and is divided in tiles. Each tiles has different terrain and shows whether units or castles are present in a tile. Tiles are either white or gray depending on whether Arthur or Cynan controls it. Characters on the map can be directly controlled after being selected. This happens in a top-down view similar to The Legend of Zelda. Characters can attack and jump. Each character has different attacks. Items can be collected and the player can move freely between tiles. Moving through tiles that are occupied by the enemy conquers those territories, but the enemy can take them back at any time by moving through them again. If two enemy units meet on the same tile, combat ensues. In real time the player must try to defeat the AI opponent. This is done through dodging his attack and trying to land a blow. To conquer a castle all enemies including those in adjacent tiles must be defeated. It is also possible to find and collect items in the direct control mode. Items serve as power-ups that for example make the player faster or restore health points.The player can return to a castle at any time to heal completely. The player can select the size of the world to increase or decrease the game&apos;s length. Additionally he or she and change the difficulty of the AI player (Cynan) and select a handicap for himself. It is also possible to play against another player.</story>

The evil Dark Matter has him under his control and plans to turn Kirby&apos;s Dream Land into a dark world, get the fabled rainbow sword and defeat him! Gameplay consists of a platform game. Kirby is like no other platform character of it&apos;s time because he can fly with no power-ups, and he can swallow enemies and get their powers. In addition to that, Kirby can now team up with his friends- Rick the hamster, Kine the fish, and Coo the owl. Each team-up has it&apos;s advantages and disadvantages, but Kirby can still swallow enemies, making more different powers available depending on the power/friend combination.</story>

    <story>Kirby&apos;s Pinball Land is a game of pinball based on the Kirby series of games, with Kirby as the ball. In the game you have to help Kirby defeat King Dedede and the three bosses who each guard one of the Pinball Lands. The game is divided into three tables or Pinball Lands, each consisting of four screens, three ordinary screens, and a boss screen If you fall off the bottom of the lowest one, you lose a life, unless you press A at the right moment to activate the springboard, which becomes harder each time. Each screen has a variety of things to do. The middle screen will give access to some sort of bonus game, where you must try to get as many points as you can, and can add to your bonus and bonus multiplier. The bonus is added to your score when you lose a life, as in ordinary pinball. The aim is to defeat each boss. To get to the boss you must perform a task on the top ordinary screen. The bosses themselves must be defeated by firing Kirby at them, but they will try to stop you, sometimes by temporarily de-activating one or both of the flippers. If you defeat the boss on each table, you face Kind Dedede himself.</story>

    <story>Kirby&apos;s Star Stacker is a Tetris-like puzzle game. There are varying modes of play, such as Time Trial, Challenge and Story Mode, but the basic idea of play is the same- you must sandwich Star Blocks between two like Friend Blocks, either horizontally or vertically. The Friend Blocks and any Star Blocks in-between are then removed from play. Similar to Tetris, sets of blocks fall into the bin that contain any two of the following types- Star Blocks- The most important block, as all of the game types rely on it. Sandwich these blocks between two Friend Blocks either horizontally or vertically, and they will be cleared. The more stars you clear, the higher the score. Friend Blocks- These blocks have pictures of Kirby&apos;s friends - Rick the Hamster, Kine the Fish, and Coo the Owl (all from Kirby&apos;s Dream Land 2) - on them. Match two of each to clear them from the screen. Any Star Blocks between the two character blocks will also be cleared. Bomb Blocks- Sandwich a Bomb Block in between two Friend Blocks, and the bomb will explode, removing all blocks in the same row. Hard Blocks- You have to clear these blocks twice to clear them from the screen. Clear them once and they transform into an ordinary Star Block, and then can be removed in the normal way. The game also features a clever &apos;chain&apos; system that rewards you for clearing blocks which then clear other blocks. If you clear two or more blocks in this manner, then you&apos;ll be rewarded with Kirby raining down that amount of Stars, which can fill in gaps, which in turn could complete a row and allow it to chain even further!</story>

    <story>Starting out with just a basic Lamborghini and $6000, your aim is to rise to the top of the 4 divisions of racing through success on 60 racetracks across America. In each division there are 20 rival racers, up to 3 of which compete in each race at a time. The races also feature lots of local drivers (who can take crucial positions away from you and the other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going at normal speed, and police. before each race you will be told of the quality of the locals and the likelihood of police presence. When police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 Km/h could see you branded as an offender, at which point the police will try to ram you off the road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach the end of the race despite this damage (which eventually hampers your speed), or simply pull over and accept a fine and the loss of race points. If the police subsequently stop you, the fine is heavier. Each race costs money to enter, and your earnings can be boosted by betting on the results with the other championship drivers. If one of you wins, each driver gives you either the amount they bet or the amount you bet, whichever is lower; if a local wins you get your stake back. Lots of power-ups can be bought along the way, including tires, radar jammers, engine improvements and nitro boosts. To move up a division you must take the Divisional Challenge, a one-off trek through a tough section within the time limit. You buy a set of 3 passes for this, each allowing one attempt.</story>

    <story>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story) starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in Project 5, a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe&apos;s intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world. While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe&apos;s best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</story>

The Fish- As a young boy, you must search out the fish called Guardian, the only fish in the river that can cure a disease caught by your sister, Teruyo. This mode combines RPG elements such as buying items, talking to the town&apos;s folk and searching the local river for the Guardian fish. The fishing element comes into play when you bait or lure fish at the river, in hopes to find a fish. Raise mode allows you to purchase a fish tank and the extras, and raise a small fish. Much like the many Pokémon type games, you can feed it, keep the tank clean and raise the fish.</story>

Link is told to awaken the wind fish and all will be answered, so Link sets out on another quest. Play is similar to the SNES game with a top down perspective. Link must go onto each of the 7 temples to retrieve a musical instrument that will help awaken the Wind Fish. Along the way, Link must search the land and uncover hidden treasures and items that will allow him to progress on his journey. With new items, he can open up new passages that will take him even farther on his quest and allow him to enter new areas that were inaccessible before. Link can attack his enemies with his sword or use items he finds during his quest to help him.

    <story>The sequel to one of the most famous games ever now has a much more significant plot. The Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces. Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones form the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players. The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any combination of skills and experiment. Unlike the first game, you are rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and Bronze are also on offer. You can also go back over levels in the hope of saving more Lems. Because there are 12 tribes, and you can switch between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress. The game saves your progress rather than using passwords as in the first game.</story>

When Simba&apos;s father, King Mufasa, is killed and his evil brother Scar takes over the kingdom, Simba is banished from the lands of his birthright and has to grow up fast, honing his skills, for the day of his return. The Lion King, based on the famous Disney movie, is a platform game where you control Simba - initially as a young cub, and later as an adult lion. The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part of the movie. As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your &amp;quot;roar meter&amp;quot; to charge. As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you&apos;re skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen). The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.</story>

    <story>In this version of Disney&apos;s The Little Mermaid you play as Ariel the mermaid. Ariel has already met Eric, and they plan to wed, but the sea-witch Ursala has taken control of the ocean! So Ariel (After explaining what&apos;s going on to Eric) becomes a mermaid once more and sets off to rescue the sea. The game takes place from a side view and Ariel (Swimming most of the time, but hopping around on the land occasionally) can shoot bubbles to trap her foes and can then throw them at each other. She can also dig through sand to find treasure and pick up sea shells to help her break chests open. The treasure she finds in the sand is usually just bonus points, but the treasure you find in chests will increase your bubble&apos;s power and range.</story>

    <story>Lock &apos;n&apos; Chase is an arcade action game similar to Pac-Man. You play a thief who has to rob banks. Each bank is a different maze, and there are policemen who chase you. You need to collect all of the gold coins and avoid the police officers. Located throughout the maze are numerous doors. As you run through the maze, you have the ability to temporarily close a door in an attempt to block the police. You can only close maximum of two doors at a time, so you can even trap a police officer between two closed doors. Closed doors automatically open again after a short amount of time. As the stages progress, extra items and hazards are introduced. There are sliding doors that open and close slowly, question marks that toggle police officers on and off, alarm clocks that wake up sleeping police officers, invisible passageways, teleporter doors etc. Occasionally a bonus item will appear in the maze, such as a cash bag that temporary stuns all police officers, and a diamond which makes you temporary invincible. Also, after clearing all stages in a bank you get to play a bonus game. You play a slot machine to earn extra lives, and each collected diamond is worth one try.</story>

    <story>A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions. Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next. Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty. The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.</story>

    <story>You play as Lucky Luke, lonesome cowboy, who draws his gun faster than his shadow. In a received telegram you read that Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Pat Poker, and The Dalton Brothers have escaped from jail. You as a good cowboy and law keeper have to catch them and return them back, finishing 12 levels of the game. Players guide Luke through levels by walking, jumping, climbing and ducking. There are also objects to collect such as dynamite (which can be used to reveal hidden paths), revolver barrels, sheriff stars and other useful items. You also have to use collected items to get past a certain obstacle, such as to show a red cloth to a bull, feed a dog with a bone, and so on. Luke can attack enemies by shooting in straight or diagonal directions. Shooting exhausts the six bullets in your gun&apos;s barrel. To kill the bandits, bad Indians, prisoners, you should shoot at them for a certain number of times. Locations of the levels vary from towns, saloons, and jails, to the prairies, ranches, and Indian village in Cheyenne Mountains. At the end of most levels you have to challenge one of the bosses, and at the end of the final level you should challenge four Daltons one after another again. Some levels are scrolling arcades such as stagecoach traveling, chasing a train, escaping the Tornado or Buffalo, or flowing in the rapids. Also the bonus level is present, where you should shoot all the bottles to get and extra life.</story>

    <story>In LUCLE, the player controls a space ship which is stranded on a foreign planet. In order to leave it, it needs to find one energy field per level. The biggest problem is how the ship is built- two round cockpits connected with a stiff rod. One of the cockpits is always fixed while the other one can be rotated around it. By alternating between the two cockpits the ship moves around the level, but of course this makes it harder to navigate tight passages. There are useful power-ups to collect like a compass and obstacles which should not be touched. Each level has to be solved within a time limit and there is no restricted number of lives.</story>

Those rows can be moved left and right (in contrast to the real game, all rows are moved at once) and turned in order to kick the ball. Players also can stop the ball and perform powerful shots which incapacitate enemy athletes (except the goalkeeper) when hit. The goal is to score more goals than the opponent; a draw results in a penalty shootout. The game features various playing options including three different surfaces, multiplayer, a training mode without an enemy team, a spectator mode for AI matches and three difficulty levels.</story>

It&apos;s also possible for Maui to combine bugs to pack a more powerful blast at his enemies. Once Maui starts to find Yin-Yang coins, he&apos;ll be able to transform into Ninja Maui. Ninja Maui has lightning-quick reflexes, and wields a bo staff. In addition to being handy for whacking enemies, Ninja Maui can also climb between walls by jumping and propping the staff between the walls at the height of his jump. He can also hook onto duck heads and swing from them to reach areas he normally couldn&apos;t. You&apos;ll need to constantly find Yin-Yang coins to fuel your Ninja persona, otherwise you&apos;ll run out and transform back to Maui Mallard. The level layout in the Game Boy version is slightly different with less secrets to be found.</story>

    <story>Mega Man is the robot creation of Dr. Light, whose sworn archenemy Dr. Wily spends innumerable games trying to cause trouble with his own odd robots. As Mega Man, you run and jump through futuristic levels, shooting baddies with your blaster, and defeat each of Dr. Wily&apos;s Robot Masters. When you defeat them, you can take their ability as your own, which can provide an advantage against other types of evil robots. In this Game Boy version, Mega Man must fight against Ice Man, Electric Man, Cut Man, and Fire Man. After he defeats those four he battles Quick Man, Heat Man, Bubble Man, and Flash Man. And after that, there&apos;s Dr. Wily&apos;s Space Node. That sounds like a lot, but passwords will save your progress, if you make it past certain milestones.</story>

    <story>Dr. Wily has broken into the Chronos Institute and stolen a machine called Time Skimmer. According to Dr. Light&apos;s calculations, he has used the machine to travel roughly 37,426 years into the future. This can mean nothing good and so Mega Man, along with his dog Rush, sets out to find out more about Dr. Wily&apos;s plans. Mega Man II follows the same formula as its predecessors, meaning the player has to complete a number of side-scrolling, platforming levels that are guarded by different bosses. Mega Man can only shoot left or right, but defeating a boss rewards him with a new weapon. Sometimes he will also find upgrades for Rush, which enable him to use Rush as a trampoline, a submarine or a jet. While Mega Man II is not a conversion, the first four stages look and play very similar to some levels of Mega Man 2 for the NES. Likewise, levels five to eight resemble some levels of Mega Man 3. The bosses of the first eight stages are also old familiars from Mega Man 2 and 3.</story>

He plans to use the incredible power generated to fuel his latest diabolical robot creation! Of course, only Mega Man can stop him! Mega Man III follows the tradition of the previous Game Boy games - you must run, jump and blast your way through four boss worlds. After defeating the four bosses, you will encounter an intermission level. Once this level is beaten, you face four more bosses, then move on to the final showdown with Dr. Wily. This is the first Game Boy Mega Man title to introduce the Mega Buster from Mega Man 4 for the NES. If you hold down the B Button, you&apos;ll be able to charge up your cannon for a more powerful shot. Mega Man III combines Snake Man, Gemini Man, Shadow Man and Spark Man from Mega Man 3 as well as Dust Man, Skull Man, Dive Man and Drill Man from Mega Man 4. In addition to this, there is a powerful Game Boy exclusive boss called Punk, who uses screw-like weapons to attack.</story>

However, they can only fall a small height before breaking which instantly fails the level. There are two playing modes with 30 levels each. Easy mode features easier puzzles and unlimited tries.

    <story>Mercenary Force is an unconventional shoot&apos;em up set in Japan&apos;s Edo period and inspired by Japanese history and mythology. When Japan is invaded by the minions of a dark lord, the shogun sets out to hire the best warriors in the land to combat the enemy. Players start with 5000 yen and must begin by hiring their mercenaries. The team has four slots and can be recruited from five different character types (servant, ninja, monk, samurai and mystic) in any combination (including more than one of any character). The characters differ in hiring price, starting health, weapons (amount of projectiles, speed and direction), and their special attack. The game consists of six levels, seen from an angled top-down/side-view perspective, with the screen scrolling automatically to the right. The mercenaries must shoot hordes of enemies to get to the next level, including several bosses. The mercenaries can change their formation between four different options- a vertical line, a diamond shape, a square shape and a horizontal arrowhead formation. It is also possible to switch the character in the lead position, leading to a large variety of tactical options. The hit points of each team member are counted individually, so if one is killed the remaining ones can fight on. Besides their standard weapon, each character also has a special suicide attack, triggered by pressing both buttons at the same time. These are usually highly devastating attacks, but the monk&apos;s power actually allows the group to skip ahead through a large part of the level. Killed enemies drop coins of 10 yen in value that disappear after a short while if not picked up. The money reserve is used in a matter of ways- between stages, new recruits can be hired to replace fallen fighters. There are also various buildings in the levels that allow the spending of money. Cafes offer various items that restore or increase health and, in some levels, can change the character class of the team leader. There is a fortune-reading at a temple which makes it possible to recruit a hidden character, and the possibility to resurrect fallen comrades at a daibutsu. Only temples don&apos;t cost money and offer healing for free.</story>

    <story>Mickey Mouse- Magic Wands! is the successor to Mickey Mouse IV- Mahou no Labyrinth and follows the gameplay formula of the Crazy Castle series. Mickey and his friends go for a walk and find a mysterious castle. As it turns out, it belongs to an evil witch who kidnaps everyone but Mickey. So of course his goal is to travel through the castle and rescue the other Disney characters. The overall 40 levels are a mix between regular platforming (jumping over platforms and avoiding enemies) and puzzle solving, e.g. using a switch to open up a way. The only way to rescue Mickey&apos;s friends is to find all hidden portrait pieces which, at the same time, is the winning condition for each level. In addition, there is a boss to defeat after all ten levels. This also upgrades Mickey&apos;s magic wand with new abilities, e.g. making water to ice, which are needed for puzzle solving. Other collectibles which can be found in the levels are crystals which may reward items when the wand is used on them, e.g. energy bar refreshments, keys (required for progress) or apples (the only weapon in the game). The levels scroll in all directions.</story>

You are to get a number of keys to reach the exit, and the paths are always reached by tricking your opponents into either being shot or just stand away for you to walk past during the time you need it. Ammo is always very limited and consists of arrows and bombs, in the fashion that you on some levels use arrows and on some bombs. The story is simple and consists of you, as Mickey Mouse, must save Minnie from an evil warlock.</story>

After completing one task, they&apos;ll receive a gift. After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy&apos;s task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters would like to receive that hammer.

    <story>If you&apos;re bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on. These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework. Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life. The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.</story>

Additionally, the Yellow, Black, Pink Rangers are extremely fast and can jump into higher areas but are more weaker than Blue, Red, White Rangers who are much stronger, but lack the speed and jumping abilities of the other Rangers. Players can refill their health by picking up heart icons and power icons to increase their morphing meter.

    <story>You play the part of Bounty Bob, and it is your mission to explore every inch of an abandoned mine. As you walk over floor sections in the mine, the floor will change color. When all of the floor sections have been changed in color, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. To reach all of the floor sections, you will need to figure out how to get there. You can jump (be careful not to fall too far though, or you will be squished), climb up and down ladders, and use different transportation devices that can be found on the levels (such as an elevator, slides, a springboard, or a cannon). Wandering around the mine are numerous radioactive creatures which get in Bounty Bob&apos;s way. Also scattered throughout the mines are various artifacts left behind; if Bounty Bob collects one of these, the creatures will temporarily become vulnerable. If Bounty Bob runs into one of the creatures in this state the creature will be destroyed, but if he runs into a creature while it is glowing Bounty Bob will be destroyed. There is a total of ten different levels, and to complete them all you will need quick reflexes as well as to figure out a unique strategy for each level.</story>

    <story>This game is based on the original arcade game Missile Command, in which aliens are attacking the Earth. In this version of the game players control two anti-missile silos and have to shoot down the incoming enemy firepower in order to defend several different major cities (such as Cairo or Moscow) that have come under siege. Cities consist of six different buildings, which the player has to try and prevent their destruction. If all the buildings are destroyed, the player loses the game. Both missile silos are equipped with fifteen missiles each and can be fired independently of each other. Players aim their missiles by moving a cursor to the desired location. The Game Boy version of the game was later re-released for the Game Boy Color. This updated version included color graphics and added a rumble feature.</story>

    <story>Muddy Mole&apos;s wife and seven kids have been kidnapped by the evil farmer, Jinbei! It&apos;s up to you to help Muddy solve the many puzzles of Jinbei Land. Snatch all of Jinbei&apos;s cabbages in every level, and if you get stuck, dig underground and create your own secret underground paths. A word of warning, however - Jinbei has got his best goons guarding your family, so you&apos;d better watch out! Mole Mania plays from an overhead perspective. Although in each room you have to destroy all the foes to progress, the game is much more puzzle-oriented than it is towards action. It is quite common in later levels to get yourself &apos;stuck&apos;, which can be fixed by leaving and returning to the screen to reset the puzzle. One of the game&apos;s clever &apos;hooks&apos; is that players can dig underground in each stage to find a completely different map than they do above ground, which can be used to get through otherwise impassable terrain. The game also features a two player mode, where one player is Muddy, and the other is Jinbei. Muddy must swipe as many cabbages as possible, and Jinbei must stop him. At the end of the round, players swap roles, and then the player who got the most cabbages wins.</story>

    <story>A powerful human called Krond conquers the Monster Planet, bans all music and declares himself king. Max, a monster rock musician decides to fight back. In order to defeat the evil monarch, he enlists in the training course at the Mega Hero Academy. Monster Max is a surreal isometric adventure by the same duo that created the 8-bit classic Head Over Heels. Not surprisingly it is very similar to that game in terms of control and general design, and almost identical graphically. The character moves on a bizarre landscape, where he has to collect and use objects (with either the A or B button) to accomplish mission objectives. The game starts on a training academy that serves as the mission hub. Each mission has as an entrance with a terminal and a door. By touching the terminal with the character, the mission objective and reward is displayed on the screen. The missions available can be played in any order, but Max has to pay a fee to access other levels with more advanced missions. On the top left of the screen there is a counter for the lucky stars collected. Lucky stars allow the character to touch dangerous objects once without suffering damage. Besides that are several hearts representing the number of lives. On the top right is the inventory display, showing the two objects assigned to the buttons. Hitting START while on a mission brings up a map, while pressing SELECT displays a menu with options and the password at the bottom of the screen. The game is far larger than previous isometric adventures like Knight Lore, with over 600 more detailed locations (the double of Head Over Heels). There is a password system to save progress.</story>

    <story>Montezuma&apos;s Return is, in contrast to to the PC game of the same name, not a completely new adventure but closely based on the design of the original Montezuma&apos;s Revenge. While some of the 150 levels are directly ported over, the majority are new. Another major difference is that the camera is closer to the action, i.e. the levels scroll instead of fitting into a single screen. The premise is the same as always- The player takes the role of an adventurer who explores a pyramid in order to steal all its treasures. In each level, the goal is to grab all treasures and reach the exit without dying, which happens instantly when touching one of the numerous enemies or falling from too large a height. Since the player has no attack option besides rarely found daggers, the majority of the game is spent dodging by using ladders or jumping. Other obstacles besides enemies are closed doors which have to be opened with keys, conveyor belts, teleporters, disappearing platforms or the time limit. Power ups grant temporary advantages such as the ability to walk through enemies or kill them by touch.</story>

    <story>Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung. Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung&apos;s mysterious island- Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself. Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent. When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a Fatality on the loser. The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale. Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game&apos;s fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</story>

    <story>Shao Kahn has won. The Earthrealm is no more. In order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn&apos;s extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population&apos;s souls. A small team of Raiden&apos;s Chosen Warriors survives the attack- Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself. Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series- multi-level playfields, Dial-A-Combo attacks, a Run button to speed up the battles, and Vs. codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself. Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the series to feature motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and introduces online network play to the PC version.</story>

Regarding gameplay, there are no specialities- the player jumps over platforms and dodges traps and enemies in order to avoid losing life energy. Getting hit too often results in losing a life. The only way to destroy enemies is to hit them with Maxie&apos;s tail and power ups grant either an extra life, a tail upgrade (range) or bonus points.</story>

As Mr. Chin, you can drop bowls on the ground with the B Button. If you place one bowl on the left and one on the right, a laser will fire between the two bowls, and any enemies will be caught between, transforming into peaches. Mr. Chin can then gobble up the peaches - if he grabs more in a row, their value increases (Mr. Chin&apos;s score is measured in calories). When Mr. Chin eats all the enemies on-screen, more quickly take their place. Gobble them all up, and when there are no more enemies in the level, you can progress to the next one. Enemies in the levels can walk on thin line paths, but Mr. Chin will fall through these - he can only walk on bricks. Mr. Chin can also smash the bricks by punching them from underneath - sometimes this will reveal a power up, such as invincibility and the ability to turn all foes into peaches instantly.</story>

    <story>In 1982, a sequel to the incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man. This sequel continued on the eat the dots/avoid the ghosts gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh. Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics. One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man. Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost&apos;s eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again. Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of Junior.</story>

    <story>In this boxing game, you control Muhammad Ali where you have to fight a series of opponents in an attempt to become the heavyweight champion of the world. The game has two modes, Single Fight and World Title Trial. Single Fight is the standard exhibition mode where you select from any of the 31 boxers available as your opponent and select the maximum number of rounds to fight between three and eight. World Title Trial is your career mode where you have to defeat boxers to earn money and move up the rankings. You begin at rank 29 and can select from the three boxers ranked below you for your first fight. You fight for a purse and winning the fight earns you that purse which you can then use to negotiate a fight against a higher ranked boxer. This mode also gives you the option of selecting the number of rounds per fight, again between three and eight. If you choose to have training turned on you can select the training method for Ali in the allocated number of weeks before his next fight. You have four attributes – power, speed, accuracy and stamina. You have five training regimes to choose from – small punch bag, skipping rope, heavy punch bag, weight training and road work training. You also have a sparring option which allows you to choose your combo punches for your fight. In the fight itself, the boxers compete in two-minute rounds. The boxers have a power meter which goes down as they get fatigued. You can punch with either the A or B button and punches deplete the health meter which is an interactive silhouette boxer. The health meter is black at full health and turns white with each punch landed, you will need to land a series of punches to weaken your opponent as the meter rises again with rest. If the meter is fully white you can finish off your opponent with a combo as the word flashes on the screen. Successfully initiating your combo knocks the opponent down in which if he does not answer to the referee’s ten count then the fight is over. The fight can also be won by a TKO (3 knock downs in a single round) or a points decision where instead of the standard 10 points per round system, the game uses a point system where a point is scored for every punch landed during the round as well as 25 points for a knock down and the one with the most points wins the fight. At the end of a training session the game gives you a password containing 16 characters of letters, numbers and symbols which you use to continue your game by selecting Continue Old Game in the main menu.</story>

These transformations are not random, but sometimes require multiple stages. If you keep good notes, you&apos;ll find out all possible transformations.

At the beginning and end of each level, there is a cut scene which consists of a still image with text, to progress the story of the game. You will of course meet many more fighters throughout the level, and pick up improved weapons as the game goes on. The gameplay is fairly standard platform work, seen in many other Ocean movie tie-ins. The Game Boy version of this game differs from the home computer version released around the same time. The level layout is different, there are no ladders ladders or ropes and you don&apos;t have to place bombs. This is possibly due to technical or game pack memory limitations of the Game Boy.</story>

The game features five different mini-games based on real-life one-on-one playing modes. All can be played by two players via the link cable. The modes are- •One On One- two players attack the same basket, alternating on offense and defense, playing to either a time or a score limit (both adjustable). •Free Throws- one player gets either 5, 10 or 20 throws. A crosshair moves over the board automatically and the button has to be pressed at the right position to make the shot. •Horse- One player has to replicate the other player&apos;s shot from the same position or gain a letter in the word H-O-R-S-E. The first player to complete the word loses. •Accuracy Shootout- Within an adjustable time limit, shots must be made from set positions for maximum score. •Tournament- a One On One tournament in knock-out mode, featuring eight players total. For each mode, players can select from 27 different players (one per NBA team of the 1989-1990 season), featuring the likes of Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Larry Bird, and Isiah Thomas.</story>

    <story>NBA All-Star Challenge 2 is a basketball game with six mini games, mostly based on real-life one-on-one variants. The main differences to the predecessor are the new mini game Slam Dunk (replaces H.O.R.S.E.) and slightly reworked graphics for the others. Before each game, the player can choose between 27 real-life athletes, one from each NBA team&apos;s 1991 roster. All games can be played by two players via the Game Boy link cable. The disciplines are-•One On One- A standard one-on-one match which is restricted to the area directly before the basket. The winning condition can be set before starting the match- either scoring a certain amount of points or scoring the most within a certain time frame. •Free Throws- This mini game is about a free throw, i.e. trying to score from a fixed place without getting disturbed by an opponent. A cursor automatically moves around the basket and when the player presses the button, the athlete throws the ball to the cursor&apos;s position. The number of throws can be set before the game. •Three Point Shootout- There are five marked points around the basket; directly at the border where scoring rewards three points. The athlete stands at each point for a certain amount of time before he switches to the next point. A throwing attempt is simply performed by pressing the button twice- first for jumping and the second time for throwing the ball. This mini game is available in a training and a competitive variant. •Slam Dunk- Before each round, the player selects the performed dunk variant from a list. This mode is shown from the side, the player moves towards the basket and has to press the right button with the correct timing to score. This mode is available in a training (the game gives a few pointers for the timing) and a competitive mode. •Accuracy Shootout- Works similar to Three Point Shootout with the difference that the points are spread all over the area. The player needs to walk to the spot and, if the previous shot was missed, collect the ball from the place it bounced to. The player can either set the points manually before the mini game starts or use the random generator. •Tournament- A series of one-on-one matches in knock-out mode. </story>

    <story>This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the NBA teams. Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers. Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate. The Tournament Edition ups each team&apos;s roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player&apos;s stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu- 1. &amp;quot;Hot Spots&amp;quot; are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them. Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant &amp;quot;on-fire,&amp;quot; enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground. &amp;quot;Juice Mode&amp;quot; increases the speed of the game up to 4x. &amp;quot;Tournament Mode&amp;quot; disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.</story>

    <story>Nemesis is the first entry in the long-running Gradius series on the Game Boy. Its side-scrolling shoot&apos;em up gameplay follows the series template closely. Players control the Vic Viper through five levels, most based on levels in earlier entries, for a kind of &apos;greatest hits&apos; of the series. There is a cave level (as in level 1 of the original Gradius), the mandatory Moai stage, a Gigeresque organic level, a graveyard (similar to bonus stages in the MSX and PC Engine version of the original Gradius) and a high-tech base. Besides the classic core ship in the first level, all boss enemies are entirely new. The cycling Gradius power-up system is reused here- collected power ups advance the power meter which can be activated at any time to gain the highlighted item. The line-up includes the classic selection of speedups, missiles, dual shots, lasers, option satellites and forcefields. The game allows players to start in any of the five levels and even to set the number of lives to a maximum of 99.</story>

Before a play, the player has the option between several tactical approaches (six in offense, seven in defense) and then the player directly controls the active athlete who is marked with an arrow. After a ball throw the control switches to the receiving athlete and the player has to catch it. Punts and kickoffs are automated.</story>

However, Emperor Garuda, an evil dictator, threatens New York city and it is up to the Ryu Hayabusa to fight him. This game is an action side-scroller. Ryu can run, jump and beat his enemies using a sword. He also has a grappling-hook device, which can be used to reach higher platforms, which can then be hand-climbed across. By collecting power ups Ryu can use a magical technique called the art of the fire wheel, an ascending and spinning wheel of fire which will take more damage than his usual sword. He has up to 5 charges of this technique. Ryu has a life meter with six units, which can be replenished by finding proper power ups inside containers. The game is divided in 5 stages. Each stages has sub-screens, and the main objective is to go from left to right till the end of the screen, destroying the enemies in the way. Among the enemies Ryu will find humans, cyborgs and machines. At the end of each stage a boss fight awaits Ryu.</story>

    <story>This soccer game was made at the time when Nintendo introduced their four player adapter, and was probably made for the four playing purpose. This is shown clearly when you choose to play 2 or more players. Then you can choose between many different ground layers, like ice, grass and stone, which adds to the replayability. When you play a one player game you play the world cup as one of the top soccer countries of that time, and you meet countries in a fixed order. Cameroon in the first match and the final is against West Germany. In an old-school fashion you lose when you play a draw, there&apos;s no extra time whatsoever. In the game you always steer only one character, which you choose before the match starts. You can then give simple orders to you team-mates, like pass, tackle and shoot. Your moves are also limited to these moves. The game is totally lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles without a wink from the referee. Probably it was made this way to be funnier to play against friends.</story>

    <story>In the 16th century, Japan&apos;s Sengoku (Warring States) period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. Nobunaga&apos;s Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei&apos;s better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness. During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include- Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe &amp;amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender&apos;s region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.</story>

    <story>Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games held in Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title to be released on the console. A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events, and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre. Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps. The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts. Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the gold points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each.</story>

The game features only five levels, two of which are played from an overhead perspective similar to Super C.

To beat those isometric levels, Bruno needs to meet conditions like solving puzzles (mostly by pushing things around) or collecting items. There are also various platforming challenges to solve and harmful enemies to avoid. Additionally each level runs on a timer - each second left on the clock when finishing a level rewards bonus points and eventually an extra life.</story>

    <story>You are cruising around in outer space when suddenly you are out of gas. The game is played from an top-down view. The gameplay is not very far from Asteroids, where you are the pilot of a ship and must complete level after level. For each level your objective is to get gas by shoot a the G-signs scattered around the levels. In some levels you have to shooting the signs in a special order. The levels must be completed in time, and you also have to watch out for enemy fire.</story>

    <story>Based on Namco&apos;s Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo. The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man&apos;s directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a wall on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop. Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It&apos;s similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games- eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area. The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man&apos;s direction with the press of a button. All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.</story>

Guess his stomach is full, &apos;cause there&apos;s nothing much to eat here, only collecting points. This is much like some Indiana Jones adventure, only your little hero&apos;s Pac-Man instead of Harrison Ford. Pac-in-time is the US release of Fury of the Furries. It&apos;s exactly the same game. Only the characters were changed- the not-so-known European Tinies (from the Skweek/Super Skweek/Tiny Skweeks/Brainies/Tinies games) were replaced by the widely known Pac-Man.</story>

    <story>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980&apos;s, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board. Pac-Man&apos;s goal is continually challenged by four ghosts- The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man. Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost&apos;s eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again. Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</story>

If the die hits another one with a matching number, the targeted dice disappears from the playing area and is added to a column at the bottom of the screen. Pressing down after lining up at least three dice of either the same number or consecutive numbers in the bottom row will destroy up to five lines at once. There are three modes of play- The standard single player mode, which requires the player to destroy a set number of lines in order to advance to the next stage; a tournament mode in which the player has to duel a number of CPU-controlled opponents and a two player mode.</story>

    <story>The player&apos;s goal is to compete with a cat to navigate and claim squares on a Bingo card, with either numbers or letters pseudorandomly arranged in 1 to 25 or A to Z, respectively. This directly contradicts the number order of real Bingo where the numbers range from 1 to 75 (with each column getting fifteen numbers assigned to it). Also contrary to standard Bingo, the card is shared by both the cat and bird, and the squares are claimed by moving to the next square of numerical/alphabetical order and pressing the A button. Since the cat and bird cannot occupy the same square, the game is more about planning and strategy than flat out luck of ordinary Bingo. Claiming five numbers in a row, column, or main diagonal is a bingo, claiming the most numbers without making a bingo is also a win.[3] In a single-player game, earning multiple simultaneous bingos will provide an extra chance for each extra line made.</story>

    <story>European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such. It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you&apos;d expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill. The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect. As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.</story>

However, there are also major and minor differences in the table design, most notably almost the whole center part of the Jailbreak table was removed. Other examples are one missing center paddle on the Kick-Off and Jackpot tables.</story>

    <story>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as &apos;flooz&apos; to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can&apos;t flow into, the pipe is finished. Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty. Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of Connect 4.</story>

    <story>Nintendo takes its game to the gridiron with NES Play Action Football. While Nintendo did not get the NFL license for this one, it did secure the license of the NFL Player&apos;s Association, so the 8 teams to choose from (all named after the appropriate NFL cities) are all stocked up with real pro players from the 1989 season. You can even substitute second-stringers for the skill positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired. Play perspective is very unusual- top-down slightly modified with a three-quarters tilt behind the offense, and the scrolling is diagonal, from the bottom left to upper right of the screen. Each team has 12 passing and 12 running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run. The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from. The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system. Games are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters. There are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout First Down! (in audio) whenever a team moves the chains. Team stats are displayed on a summary screen after every quarter of play. Highest scoring team wins, which in playoffs mode means moving on to the next round--and an eventual shot at winning it all in the Power Bowl!</story>

    <story>Long, long ago, the sun was covered by a dark and heavy cloud. It was said this cloud was caused by a monster that had sealed the Sword of the Sun. Legends also says that to break the seal, a hero must collect five Power Stones that are guarded by monsters. Bomberman takes up the challenge as he is the last hero strong enough to defeat such monsters. This is a side-scrolling platform game. In each world, you must clear four areas by killing any monsters within. To kill a monster, you drop a bomb. After a few seconds, the bomb explodes in a four-way blast. If the monster is within range of the blast, it is killed. After you clear these four areas, you must clear a fifth area by killing a boss to clear the world and collect its Power Stone. Be careful, though, because if Bomberman is touched by a monster, touches a dangerous item or is caught in the blast of his own bomb, you lose a life. After all lives are gone, you get the option to restart that last area or quit. In most areas, you can, though the placement of bombs, find items to increase your jumping, speed, blast radius, etc.</story>

    <story>Pokémon Yellow, along with Pokémon Blue and Pokémon Red forms the first generation of Pokémon games. You control a number of fictional animals known as Pokémon and must travel the land using your current Pokémon to defeat and capture more. There are 151 Pokémon that fall into various types such as fire, water and grass that have a complicated rock-paper-scissors relationship. You come across a series of town, each of which contains a gym where you must do battle with other Pokémon trainers. Each gym specializes in a different type of Pokémon. After beating each gym, you are given a new ability that lets you travel to new areas. The object of the game is to defeat all eight gym leaders, or ultimately, to catch all the varieties of Pokémon. Some of them are not actually catchable in Yellow, so you must use the Game Boy link function to trade with friends using Red and Blue to complete your collection. Pokémon Yellow differs from the other first-generation games because it is based on the Pokémon animé series. The main character looks like Ash and he starts the game with Pikachu, rather than choosing a Pokémon as in all other games in the series. Character graphics throughout the game are based on designs from the series and it includes Jesse, James and their Meowth, which the other games do not.</story>

The game uses the classic gameplay mechanics for the genre, with you controlling your craft as the background scrolls vertically towards the end of the stage and trying to survive and destroy all enemies with your laser shots. Twinbee features a selectable power-up system in which you must shoot the bell power-ups to select which type of upgrade you want depending on the color they take (or in this case, the shade of grey).

    <story>You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest. To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god. Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness. Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not. To get a chance to win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on. The more followers you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same. When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero. He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy. When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy&apos;s people. He will burn; he will kill. And he won&apos;t stop until they&apos;re all dead... or he is. But you don&apos;t have to let your people have all the fun; the gods have other tools as well. You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers, submerge their towns in swamps, or raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland. Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn&apos;t build on high ground. </story>

    <story>Power Racer is a conversion of the arcade game Head On that includes an extra special mode. The normal mode is a faithful recreation of the original- the playing field consists of a square race track with four lanes. Between the corners the lanes are partly interrupted so the lane can be changed. This is needed because on the uninterrupted parts there are dots which all have to be picked up to progress to the next level. There is also another (on higher levels two) car on the track which tries to crash into the player - of course this needs to be avoided. This mode features ten difficulty levels. The special mode adds a few things to the basic playing principle. In this mode there are three difficulty levels and nine tracks which all add variations to the playing field, e.g. a different lane layout, oil slicks which cause the car to spin when driving over it or conveyor belts. There are also a few power ups which randomly appear on the track and need to be picked up within a limited time frame. Most of them are not activated instantly and can be used at a opportune time. The power ups are a bomb (causes a near enemy to spin), a level skip, an extra live, a shield, an enemy slow down and one which causes all cars to make a u-turn. This mode can be played by two human players.</story>

    <story>The Grand Vizier Jaffar has thrown you into a dark dungeon and plans to marry the girl of your dreams in an hour. You&apos;re not going to let that happen are you? Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar&apos;s guards, find your way through the Sultan&apos;s palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you&apos;ve got 60 minutes! Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character. The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</story>

The object is to kill the bad guys who either are walking around or hiding in the environment while also picking up ammo, grenades and health by shooting them. Your health is constantly drained while enemies are shooting, so if you want to last, you must cap them as soon as they appear.</story>

    <story>In Q Billion, you play a mouse which must level out a playfield filled with stacks of tiles. To do this, the mouse must climb onto one stack and push a taller, neighbouring stack so that tiles fall off, until there are no tiles stacked on top of each other. Oftentimes, there stacks are not adjacent to each other, which forces the mouse to push a tile next to the stack in order to have something to stand on. Since the mouse is so weak, it can only move a single tile. This calls for a lot of juggling, since in order to move a stack of three tiles (represented by a 3 in a square), it must move a single tile next to a stack of two tiles, then move another tile to the other side of the small stack and push the uppermost tile of the stack onto the single tile in order to create a stack of two next to the stack of three. If there is a distance greater than one or two squares between the stacks, it makes the task daunting and requires a lot of planning, which puts this game straight into the old style of Japanese puzzles pioneered by Sokoban. Later stages introduce tiles of different kinds, symbolised by hearts, squares or stars. These tiles will, when moved together in groups of four, be eliminated; or at least the uppermost layer will. This calls for three-dimensional – or even four-dimensional – thinking on behalf of the player. None of the special tiles must be left on the screen for the stage to be cleared. A second gaming mode contains ready-made puzzles which must be solved in a limited amount of time. An editing mode will also allow the player to create levels of his own.</story>

    <story>Q bert is a conversion of the popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off the board while Q bert is safely transported to the top.</story>

Drawing the rectangles using the slow method awards you the most points. Once a rectangle has been made, it will be colored in to show that you have claimed your territory. While drawing the rectangles, you need to watch out for Qix (pronounced kicks), a series of colored lines that crawl the screen. In addition to Qix, you also need to avoid the Sparks who travel around the border, as well as any lines that you have made, as well as The Fuse, who travels along the line that you are drawing.

    <story>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot &apos;em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay. You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire. The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called The Force, which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements). The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger&apos;s artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot&apos;em&apos;ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type&apos;s contemporary rival, Gradius.</story>

The second mode is more of a side-scrolling shooter. The player controls a submarine, trying to destroy the enemy fleet before they take the player&apos;s vessel out. Either the player takes out all the battleships causing the enemy submarine to surrender or he directly destroys the submarine to end the level. When submerged a radar view appears, showing the player&apos;s ships along with the enemies, providing a strategic intermission to plot out the attack.</story>

    <story>The Real Ghostbusters, known as Garfield Labyrinth in Europe and Mickey Mouse IV- Mahou no Labyrinth in Japan, is a puzzle/platform game. The story is very simple- Venkman (or Garfield and Odie or Mickey and Mini Mouse, depending on the version you play) walk over a bridge one day, a tile breaks loose and Venkman/Garfield/Mickey falls down a deep pit, which ends up in a bizarre labyrinth, which Venkman/Garfield/Mickey must escape. There&apos;s no other goal apart from that, the player just needs to find the exit in each level. Apart from getting there, the exit must also be unlocked. For the latter, the player must collect all gems in the level. Each level contains various traps and enemies which need to be avoided. The puzzles involve finding keys to lower bridges or open doors, make use of teleporters and especially- drilling away blocks. Conveniently, the player finds a pneumatic hammer at the beginning of the game, which must be used to create paths to certain areas and items, without blocking the way forth or back. There&apos;s also an inventory to store items like keys and bombs (used to kill enemies). The protagonist has a health bar and can take several hits before losing a life, but there is also a time limit for each level. The game features a password system, a password is given automatically after completing a level. In spite of the differences in main character and a minor variation in the short intro cinematic all regional versions are identical.</story>

    <story>Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows. By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you&apos;re knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race. Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.</story>

Hearts can be restored by picking up power-ups. When enemies get close the player can also punch them. RoboCop can also employ a a jetpack to fly around the levels. Aside from enemies there are also other hazards such as falling bombs, electricity and rolling barrels. In between normal levels the player can expect boss fights and a sliding puzzle with mugshots. </story>

    <story>The crossover of the two 80s Action/Sci-Fi franchises comes to the Game Boy in this platform title, based very loosely on a Dark Horse comic. The player controls RoboCop, who, while taking care of law &amp; order in Detroit, discovers some unusual troublemakers- Terminators sent from the future. To deal with the threat, Robo will have to make his way through an OCP factory and computer complex, where a time machine awaits that will take him to the post-nuclear wasteland of future Los Angeles. There, he must destroy the Skynet mainframe to free humanity from the machines once and for all. The game is a platforming affair. RoboCop must destroy various enemies while looking for the level exit, from various criminals in Detroit to advanced robotic probes, Terminators and flying Hunter Killers in in the OCP labs and the future. He is armed with a simple gun which can be upgraded once to a three-directional scatter shot. A single hit means the gun upgrade is lost, though. Life energy can be refilled through power-ups, and extra lives are also available.</story>

    <story>Taking a rather literal view of the term &apos;slap-stick humour&apos;, Rodland features two fairies called Tam and Rit, whose mission is to rescue their mum who&apos;s been captured and taken to a castle. There are 40 screens to clear, all full of baddies, who are disposed of by grabbing them with a stick, and flipping them from side to side to inflict damage. The hits needn&apos;t all be inflicted at the same time, as it&apos;s possible to release them to move them out of the way. When killed, each bad guy releases some kind of extra, ranging from points bonuses to various devices which can be used to kill other enemies. Each level also contains a certain amount of fruit. If you can collect all of this (with some bad guys still alive - you move on immediately once they&apos;re gone) you enter a bonus game, in which each enemy&apos;s death results in one of the letters E,X,T,R and A being released - collect them all for an invaluable extra life. In the Game Boy version the difficulty lies slightly lower because the player can use his wand even when climbing ladders.</story>

    <story>Sensible Soccer - European Champions (known in the US as Championship Soccer &apos;94) is a soccer (football) game similar to the Kick Off series. The graphical view is from a distance overhead, making the players small on screen, but allowing player to view around half the pitch. The basic control system involves loose control, making running with the ball (‘dribbling’ in football parlance) a skill to master, and putting the emphasis on one-touch passing, which can be easily performed by tapping the fire button. The game features customisable league and cup competitions as well as pre-set ones including the 1992 European Championships. There are 168 teams in total, 40 European nations, the 64 top club sides, and 64 custom teams with names ranging from self-indulgent to comical, and their details are fully editable. At club and country level, each team has three star players who are more gifted that the others.</story>

    <story>Shanghai is a tile-based game based on the ancient Chinese game of Mah-Jong. The gameplay involves 144 tiles, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the center. A tile can only be removed if it is open on at least one side. This version of Shanghai was licensed from Activision by Hal Laboratory for release on the Game Boy. Unlike the Shanghai series published under Activision, this port contains only a single game layout, that of the standard setup sometimes referred to as The Turtle or The Pyramid. The game features two options for the visual style of the facecards, either in small designs or in simple letters or numbers. The former is more decorative, but the latter is easier to read. There are also three options for background music that may be selected under a menu by pressing the Select button. Like other versions of Shanghai, there is also a hint mode for when players get stuck.</story>

You have to help Scratchy both score well on the golf course, and avoid Itchy to survive. The game is played from a side-scrolling perspective, much like a platformer. To fend off Itchy, you can pick up weapons like a baseball bat, or throwing knives.</story>

Homer Simpson spits the beans out the window where they grow into a massive stalk reaching into the clouds. The game is a platformer with some shooter elements. The player, as Bart, must jump between platforms and vines through all sorts of tricky hazards to the giant&apos;s castle in the clouds and make it back down alive.

    <story>Skate Or Die- Bad&apos;N Rad is a Jump&apos;N Run that consists of 7 levels, three of which are viewed from a top-down perspective. The side-scrolling levels play similar to other Jump&apos;N Runs, as you have to avoid obstacles and kill enemies by jumping on them. However, since you are on a skateboard, speed plays an important role, meaning that you cannot immediately stop and sometimes need to drive at full speed to manage wider jumps. The top-down levels play more similar to other Skate Or Die games as gradients influence your driving while you are trying to avoid obstacles, enemies and deadly spikes.</story>

    <story>Skate or Die- Tour de Thrash is a skateboard game with two playing modes. The first, Retro Rocket Ramp is almost identical to the ramp mode of Skate or Die 2- The Search for Double Trouble. The player is presented with a half-pipe shown from the side and skates on it. If one of the two sides is reached, stunts can be performed by pressing buttons. Which ones are performed depends on the speed and how long the buttons are pressed - the more dangerous, the more points they award. The goal is to gather as many points as possible in a limited amount of time. The second mode is called Stale Fish Tour which takes the player through championships all over the world. Here the skater is shown from behind and races inside a sustained half-pipe. The player can accelerate, brake, move left and right, jump and duck. The goal is to reach the end of the course within three minutes. There are various obstacles which need to be dodged, e.g. concrete walls - bumping into them (or skating over the borders of the half-pipe) means the loss of valuable time. Sometimes there is an AI skater to deal with. This mode can also be played against another human player.</story>

The goal is simply to find the goal without dying; in one instance within a hidden time limit. However, during the first four levels Archer is completely defenseless and has to dodge the enemies. The last level introduces two new gameplay mechanics- a bow which stuns enemies and simple switch puzzles. The levels are side-scrolling, but there are junctions.</story>

It&apos;s up to Attila and Genghis to eat their way through sixteen tricky stages as they avoid nasty traps and open the exits by standing on the scales to open the exit door. Sneaky Snakes is a pseudo-sequel to the NES game Snake, Rattle &apos;n Roll. However, instead of an isometric playfield, the game is this time a standard sidescrolling platformer. Players can play as Attila (or link up and play simultaneously with a friend as Genghis) through various devious levels. The goal of each level is to eat enough Nibbleys (round creatures which come in assorted flavors including balloons, jellyfish, joggers, and more) to earn enough tail segments. When your snake has enough segments, its body will flash, and you can weigh yourself to open the exit gate and progress to the next level. Each level has a time limit of 99 seconds - if this runs out, a giant ax will appear, chasing after your snake until it eventually destroys it. To prevent this from occurring, you can collect clocks which add another 30 seconds to your time limit. You can also collect power ups such as increased jump height, tongue extensions, and diamonds which briefly make you invincible.</story>

    <story>Nick and Tom are two Princes living the dream with two beautiful princesses. When suddenly the evil King Scorch freezes Prince Nick and Tom and kidnaps the Princesses. Now Nick and Tom find themselves with abilities dealing with snow and ice. These two Snow Brothers will need to hunt down the evil King Scorch and rescue the princesses. Snow Bros. is a fixed-screen platform game where players must defeat all enemies on each level (screen), 50 altogether. The Snow Bros use snow as their weapon, throwing it at the enemies to stun them. When lots of snow is thrown at an enemy, it becomes covered in a flurry and unable to move. These can be rolled into giant snowballs and pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually defrost and become angry at the player. The enemy filled snowballs are a much stronger weapon then the regular handful of snow and are the only effective weapon Nick and Tom have against the bosses.</story>

When the four towers have been climbed, the fifth tower remains. To get through the door and on to the next floor in the towers, Spanky must collect keys, which are sometimes held by the baddies. To aid him, he has a magic ball. Throwing the ball will stun the baddies for a short while, but not defeat them. However, by bouncing the ball it will grow in size, and depending on its size, it will explode in different patterns, and the shrapnel will kill off the baddies, clearing the way and releasing keys. Published by in Europe by Taito, Spanky fit straight into the company&apos;s portfolio of puzzle arcade platformers in the Bubble Bobble vein. The game also exists for the SNES, but the level layouts differ, as well as the fact that one cannot choose freely between the towers.</story>

    <story>Brutal Deluxe doesn&apos;t live up to their name - in fact they&apos;re the worst team Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 &apos;legs&apos; with the aggregate score deciding who progresses. You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents. The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are &apos;portals&apos; which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going. You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important. A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team&apos;s power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.</story>

Here the player has to push blocks into certain marked positions, but they cant be pulled. In those stages the level can be reset without penalty.

    <story>This entry in the game series based on the Spy vs Spy comic strip series has a similar gameplay premise as the other games of the series, but a different set of levels (overall 20) and scenarios (tropical, lava, ice, cave and pyramid). Another apparent difference is the missing split-screen which normally shows the locations of both spies. The player either takes control of the black or white spy who both have the same goal- finding the five hidden items and reach the exit within the time limit. Additionally a briefcase has to be found in order to hold more than one object at once. Those items are randomly divided over the levels. The main challenge of the game is to deal with the other spy, mostly by laying out traps. They are either fake chests or special areas in the level, e.g. a cloud can be prepared to hit a spy with a lightning - but they don&apos;t differentiate between the agents. A trap can be triggered without taking damage when quick enough. Each spy has a health bar which is lowered by traps, fist fights against the other spy or walking into a level obstacle. Losing energy lowers the speed and ability to jump and eventually leads to death. The spy will re-spawn after a few seconds but loses all collected items.</story>

Levels differ in difficulty by speeding up the descent of the cards and limiting the amount of time you can pause the game to make decisions.</story>

Perhaps the name of the place should have tipped you off, but it&apos;s too late for regrets now--a slew of insane alien mutations are now trying to slaughter you. Combinations of technology and flesh, these bad boys have only one objective--kill. Make your way through five massive levels, fending off beasts of all shapes and sizes with any weapon you can get your hands on. Your attackers will come at you with globule-emitting eyeballs, poising-spewing phenocytes, and razor-sharp energy disks. As if that&apos;s not enough, a boss character that is even more deadly guards each level. Yeesh. Good luck. </story>

    <story>This 1991 release was intended to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the 60&apos;s television series. The plot of this Trek is based around a giant Doomsday Machine that is destroying ships, planets, and other valuable stuff in federation space. The Federation has constructed a weapon to defeat the doomsday machine, but the Klingons think that it will be used against them. So, they steal the weapon and break it up into 12 pieces spread out over 3 planets. It is up to the crew of the Enterprise to travel to the 3 planets, recover all 12 pieces of the weapon, and finally stop the Doomsday Machine. There are two modes of game play. First, there is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up in which you pilot the Enterprise through asteroid fields and enemy fleets. Second, there is a overhead-view game in which you maneuver Captain Kirk around the planet to gather up the pieces of the weapon.</story>

Star Trek- The Next Generation is divided into a series of missions. Players will start on the main screen of the bridge and from there can access Navigation, Tactical, Operations, Engineering, Transporter Systems and Mission Control. Mini-games are sometimes used to complete certain ship functions (such as rerouting power to the shields).</story>

    <story>Beyond the Nexus is based on the seventh Star Trek movie and its story- Captains Kirk and Picard must team up to stop a mad scientist from destroying an inhabited planet so that he might reenter the mysterious Nexus energy ribbon. The game has several different playing modes. The first is starship combat- seen from the main screen of the Enterprise (both the -B or the -D version) you navigate the ship through space, firing phasers or photon torpedoes at enemies like Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. Another mode has you navigating the ship to its destination by flying through rectangles in space. On away missions, the view switches to a top-down perspective where you control a single character and can fire your phaser at enemies. Finally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the first one, frequencies must be decoded- this is done by putting symbols into the right order. One can only guess the order at first, but after an attempt the game reveals how many of the selected symbols are part of the combination and how many are in the right place. Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a limited number of tries. The second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To do so, a path must be built on a grid for the energy to flow through. The path must be built out of randomly assigned pieces that don&apos;t always fit together, similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.</story>

    <story>The handheld version of Stargate is a matching puzzle game, similar to a 3-D Tetris. Players drop tiles into a Stargate, and try to stack three identical symbols. Doing so clears those tiles. Mismatched tiles simply build stacks higher and higher, and the player loses if the tiles reach the top of the gate. The player is also given a seven-symbol Stargate address along the top of the screen. Stacking three copies of a symbol listed in the address will clear the stack and counts toward completing the address. There are two game modes building on this basic concept- 1. Skill Mode is a single-player challenge where the player tries to complete as many addresses as they can before being overwhelmed. Speed increases with completed addresses. Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or against a second player connected with a link cable. In Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are sent through the Stargate and appear on your opponent&apos;s side. A height level meter is added on the sides to show how close you and your opponent are to overflowing their gates. You can win by outlasting your opponent (while sending complete stacks through to make things more difficult for them) or by being the first to complete the address.</story>

The player takes the role of a sumo wrestler who has to cross five levels (each with three stages plus a boss) to rescue his kidnapped girlfriend. The protagonist has two means of attack- his fists and a stomp attack which, in addition to the damage, can stun enemies. Experience points are awarded for killing enemies, solving hidden mini games and collecting power-ups like health refreshments or temporary invincibility. Eventually this leads to a level up and the player can choose to upgrade one of the two attacks or increase his maximum health. The mini games are sumo wrestling, arm wrestling and thumb wrestling. All are reaction tests in which a button has to be pressed to stop a cursor moving left and right at the correct spot.</story>

The player takes control over a police car which has to track down a villain in each of the seven levels. In each level, the goal is to reach the end within the time limit. However, there are many obstacles and slower cars which need to be avoided. Every contact reduces the time on the clock. When the level boss is reached, he needs to be taken down by repeatedly ramming his vehicle - or using the weapons which can be collected in some levels. After beating a level, points are awarded for all accomplishments (time left, passed cars, etc.) which can be invested into car upgrades (speed, handling or attack power against bosses) or turbo boosts which can be activated at any time. There are multiple difficulty levels and gearing can be either manually or automatically.</story>

    <story>Superman is a sidescrolling action game starring DC Comics&apos; titular Man of Steel. It features character designs based on Superman- The Animated Series. In each level, you must collect a certain number of keys, and possibly fight a boss, then step on a marked area to leave. Keys may be found around in the environment or collected from defeated enemies. Superman attacks by punching his enemies, or by punching to deflect their bullets back at them. He can navigate environments through standard walking, or, he can hold down the jump button to fly. He must be careful of bombs which are floating throughout the levels as running into them causes loss of health. He also must face other environmental hazards, like electrical barriers. Some levels put ground under your feet and play some like a normal platforming/fighting game, albeit with flight. Others are all flying and forced scrolling, making them something like a 2D shooter with no ranged attack where you must hold down a fly button to stay aloft.</story>

    <story>500 years ago King Winder had sealed the evil Demon Zakdos within a casket, thus ending the dark war. The great wizard Colin pledged that he and his descendants would build and protect a temple around Zakdos&apos; prison. However, as a thief enters the temple and breaks the casket, Zakdos is set free and murders all that are left of the clan of Colin except for a young boy named Mute. To make things worse, the Sword of Hope, that has sealed away an evil dragon, is also stolen. The player takes control of Prince Theo who, with the help of Mute and other characters, must stop Zakdos and retrieve the Sword of Hope before the dragon awakens. The main difference between The Sword of Hope II and its predecessor is the fact that you have control over a party of up to three characters rather than controlling only prince Theo. Apart from that, both games play very similar. The world is seen from a first person perspective and your party can be moved by selecting an arrow that points in the desired direction. Commands such as look, open, hit etc. can be chosen from a menu to explore and manipulate the game-world, talk to NPCs or solve puzzles. When encountering enemies, you enter a turn-based battle mode in which you can attack, use items and magic or try to escape.</story>

After living in the forest for 15 years, Prince Theo is finally strong enough to try and stop the dragon, using the Sword of Hope one of the magicians had retrieved. Sword of Hope combines Adventure and RPG elements. The prince can select commands such as look, open, magic, use etc. to interact with the game world, talk to NPCs or solve puzzles.

    <story>As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film Terminator 2- Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected. T2- The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill. Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).</story>

    <story>Once again a peaceful kingdom, this time named Moberry, was assaulted by an evil entity. The player, taking control over the alligator Charly, has the task to defeat the dragon warlord Basso Gila. To do so, five areas (with three or four levels each) have to be conquered. Those levels can be tackled in any order and - for the first three areas - are either land, air, cave or underwater levels. Of course there are also a number of enemies which try to harm Charly- every contact with them or environmental obstacles makes a heart from the health bar disappear. Charly can defeat himself by hitting enemies with his tail (the range depending on the power meter). The goal of each level is not only to reach the exit and defeat the occasional boss, but also to open all treasure chests on the way. Those contain random power ups, e.g. health refreshments, bonus points, power or a bomb which kills everything on screen. The last chest in a level contains the key which is needed to open the exit.</story>

The air pirates, lead by the daring Don Karnage have increased their attacks against air travel. In order to foil the plans of the pirates, Baloo trades in his normal plane for a Mini Sea Duck, designed to fly more maneuverably.To get his cargo delivered on time, Baloo must fly over many dangerous areas, and also pick up any cargo stolen or scattered by the air pirates. Eventually, the fortress of the air pirates themselves must be destroyed for air travel to remain safe and profitable. Talespin is a side-scrolling shooter, moving left to right across the screen. The Mini-Seaduck can fire projectiles and switch direction, flying right-to-left while upside-down. The money you make from recovery of these cargo items can be used to purchase upgrades at the end of each level from Wildcat, the mechanic.

Look after the Tamagotchi and help it grow up. Tamagotchi is a game based on the popular virtual pet of the same name. In it, you select an egg from the laboratory, and then it hatches in its room. From there, you are fully responsible for its care. Everything from feeding, medicine, playing with it, cleaning up its poo and scolding or praising it when appropriate - you must do it all. Unlike the actual Tamagotchi toy, the Game Boy version is not in realtime - you can adjust the Tamagotchi&apos;s growth speed in the game options. You can also look after up to three Tamagotchis simultaneously. The Game Boy version also features three different games to play with your pet - depending on the game you select, it will improve their mood, their intelligence, or their physical fitness. The three games are- • Smile Game - Your pet will look left and right. Try to guess which direction it will face next. • Study Game - Help your Tamagotchi study. Simple math questions will appear and you must help it answer them. • Sports Game - Keep your Tamagotchi fit. Baseballs will rain down from the sky. Get your pet to them before they hit the floor to score a point. Another feature exclusive to the Game Boy version are Tournaments. You can enter your pet in Race, Beauty and Knowledge tournaments. You can increase your chances of winning in these by training your pet, but make sure that when you enter them that it&apos;s not sick or spoiled, as it will not perform as well as it could. Win a tournament and your Tamagotchi will be placed in the Hall of Fame. </story>

The player takes the role of Taz who has to free his family which was kidnapped by the two hunters Bull Gator and Axl. This is basically a standard platformer in which the player crosses the 16 levels, jumps over gaps and dodges enemies. However, the unique feature of the cartoon Taz was converted to the game- his ability to spin. This allows him to reach high acceleration and being invulnerable - but every second takes away a part of the associated energy bar. It can be refilled by picking up one of the power ups on the way. Every level has to be solved within a time limit and Taz loses one of four hearts when hit by an enemy or touching water.</story>

    <story>The most popular American football game to hit the NES console, Tecmo Bowl pits the player vs. the computer in 11 game single-elimination playoff action, or you can go head-to-head with a human opponent in action or coach mode. There are 12 teams of real NFL players (circa 1988) to choose from, but don&apos;t look for official NFL team logos or mascots like Bears or Dolphins--Tecmo Bowl has the NFLPA but not the NFL license. The play perspective is top-down and the screen scrolls horizontally. Player graphics are large and colorful, which is made possible by limiting the number of players to nine per team. Animated cut-scenes are shown following touchdowns and at half-time, and crowds are shown filling the endzone seats. There are four plays to choose from on offense--usually two runs and two passes. The player takes control of the quarterback before the snap and then either hands off to the running back or works through his receiver progression from the top to the bottom of the screen. Defense consists of trying to guess which offensive play the opponent will select and then taking control of one of the defensive players before the snap. A very simple power meter system is used for kicking field goals, extra points, and punts. There are no game or season stats and there is no way to save your season, but there is a password feature allowing you to resume tournament play where you left off.</story>

    <story>This game is the first in a series of Game Boy games by Konami based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of comic books, movies, cartoons, toys, etc. The basic premise of the TMNT is this- Four turtles, living in a sewer in New York, are exposed to some radioactive goo. The goo turns them into humanoid creatures and gives them approximately human intelligence. Hence, they are mutants. Also, they are teenage turtles, which means they all talk like surfers and like to eat pizza. An equally mutated, but apparently much older, rat named Splinter acts as the turtle&apos;s guardian. He trains the turtles to be ninjas, and to fight crime. He also gives the turtle&apos;s their names- Michaelangelo, Donatello, Raphael, and Leonardo. In the game, the Turtles&apos; TV reporter friend, April, is kidnapped by the evil samurai, Shredder. The turtles must rescue her and defeat Shredder. Gameplay consists of standard side-scrolling jump-and-attack action. Occasionally, hidden bonus games appear to give your turtle bonus health points.</story>

    <story>The second TMNT game for the Game Boy brings more of the same action that we saw in the first. The story is basically unchanged. Shredder and Krang have an evil plot to take over the world, and have kid-napped April. You have to guide the four turtles to rescue her and save the day. Back from the Sewers features 6 side-scrolling levels. In between levels, you are treated to bonus games that allow you to increase your health meter or rescue captured turtles. The music in the game is a surprisingly accurate rendition of the music found in the cartoon series. This is also one of the first Game Boy games to feature digitized speech.</story>

    <story>The third Ninja Turtle adventure on the Game Boy takes place one year after the events of the last game. Shredder has escaped from prison, and managed to capture turtle-friendly reporter April O&apos;Neal yet again! Only this time, he manages to capture three of the turtles, Raphael, Donatello, and Leonardo, before the game even starts. So, you start out as Michaelangelo on a quest to rescue your pals and restore justice to the city. Radical Rescue differs from the previous Ninja Turtle games greatly in terms of level structure. The linear levels have been replaced with one huge interconnected fortress. You progress through the game by finding the various bosses hidden within the fortress, defeating them, and then using the keys they leave behind to open up new rooms. When you happen to find one of the turtles that has been captured, they become a playable character.</story>

    <story>Terminator 2- Judgement Day is a game based on the movie of the same name. The Game Boy version is unlike the console and computer versions of the game. The game takes place in two time periods- 2029, when the Terminators have taken over the world, and 1994, when John Connor is ten years old and his future self has reprogrammed a Terminator to protect him from a more advanced model. In the early levels of the game, you play as the future John Connor - your objectives are to destroy generators to gain access to Skynet. Once inside, you must make your way through Skynet and obtain a Terminator yourself. These levels are played in a side-scrolling fashion. The next level is a difficult puzzle - you must reprogram the Terminator so that it will protect John Connor instead of killing him. You need to realign the wires so that power cells can reach their destinations and reset the program. Once you pass this level, you take on the role of the Terminator in 1994. You must protect John Connor while on a motorbike being chased by the T-1000. Later levels include infiltrating Cyberdyne to obtain the previous Terminator&apos;s arm and chip, and the final showdown with the T-1000 at the steel mill.</story>

Gameplay consisted of flipping tesserae, or tiles, from squares over adjacent squares. The result would either create a complex tile, or cancel out, resulting in the deletion of a tile. The goal was to clear the board entirely. Higher levels were designated by added tile complexity, and larger board grid sizes.</story>

    <story>This version of Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game, and was included with the Game Boy upon its release in several territories. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases and the background changes, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well. The game is very similar to Nintendo&apos;s own NES version of the game, featuring the same Type A endless and Type B set-clear modes. The game also features a 2-player versus mode that can be played with two Game Boys, two copies of Tetris, and a Game Boy link cable. Clearing lines in this mode will cause the other player&apos;s stack to rise, with the goal being to make the other player lose.</story>

Each play field starts with different colored dots (in this case black, gray and white), with one of each color flashing. The blocks are made up of the same three colors, and by matching blocks of the same color over the top or to the side of the dot will clear the dot and those blocks from the screen. If you clear a flashing dot, all the corresponding dots of the same color will be cleared. To complete the round just clear the dots, not the blocks themselves.</story>

    <story>All is not well on Yoshi&apos;s Island! The devious king Bowser has cast a spell on the island&apos;s inhabitants, turning them into his mindless slaves. Only Yoshi has escaped its effects, and so he must set off to free his friends, and to defeat Bowser and break the spell. Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler featuring the colorful cast of characters from Yoshi&apos;s Island. A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which can swap any two blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three or more and they&apos;ll clear, potentially creating combos from new blocks falling to take their place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to your opponent, which must be eliminated by clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it into normal blocks. The game offers a story mode against the computer, as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless mode, a timed mode where a certain number of blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a specific number of moves. The game is based on the Japan-only title Panel de Pon.</story>

By linking the bombs while clearing the play field as usual (creating a line of blocks), more of the field is cleared as the bombs explode.

The rest is more loosely adapted- in contrast to the comic, which is mostly based in Peru, this game offers many different locations all over the world. The gameplay itself is a typical platforming action- Tintin walks through the levels while avoiding the enemies. Pretty much everyone, e.g. little girls and security guards, is out to hurt Tintin who has no means of defending himself. This means the most important aspect is learning enemy placements, their patterns and how to avoid them. But he has to hurry because of the time limit. Required for success is the usage of the two playing plains- from the player&apos;s perspective in the foreground and further towards the background.

    <story>The war of 1999 left the country of Kookistan in shambles. Naturally, a dictator named General Akhboob took control of the beleagured nation and began creating an army of radioactive mutants. With a virtually impenetrable stronghold, a bunch of hostages, and a legion of mutants under his command, the evil despot will stop at nothing but world domination. Only two men have the courage and idealistic naivete to take on Akhboob and his forces- Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem, also known as the Doomsday Squad. As Captain Carnage or Major Mayhem, it is up to you or you and a friend (in simultaneous action) to rescue the hostages while shooting hundreds of mutants bent on your destruction. As you walk and run forward, backward, left, right, and diagonally through 20 battlezones of nonstop action, you&apos;ll always have your machine gun by your side. Additional weapons which you can find along the way include grenade launchers, rocket launchers, plasma machine guns, flame throwers, spray-fire rifles, defensive blades, and an assortment of bombs.</story>

    <story>Thanks to the Maita Flower, Trip World is at peace. It is being protected by an old Shabubu, a member of a race of bunny-like beings. The flower grows on the holy mountain known as Mount Dubious. However, one day the old Shabubu is attacked and the Maita Flower is stolen. Trip World becomes disarranged and its inhabitants don&apos;t stop quarreling with each other. But there is one hope in the form of the old Shabubu&apos;s grandson, Yacopu (also spelled Yakopoo). The player controls Yacopu through five stages in this side-scrolling platformer. The young Shabubu&apos;s trademark ability is to shapeshift into different forms. In his normal form, he is able to walk and jump as well as to kick enemies, Yacopu&apos;s primary way of attacking. Unlike in many other platformers, many of the enemies don&apos;t harm you on contact and push your character around instead. However, certain foes might attack you after you damaged them, while others do so from the beginning. At almost any time, the player can change to the flying or fish form. Flying Yacopu is able to reach places he wouldn&apos;t otherwise be able to, while the fishy hero is best suited for underwater areas. You also come across power-ups that temporarily give your character new powers, such as stunning enemies with seeds, bouncing around as a ball, or attacking with an extended tail. Beneath the mountain, settings in the game include a jungle, the ocean, and a castle. In each stages, you have to defeat a boss at the end. Eventually, you will encounter the one who stole the Maita Flower. The flower must be retrieved in order to save peace in Trip World.</story>

Enemies will often give out letters that spell out the word TUMBLEPOP. If the player collects all the letters, the current level is bypassed and a bonus game will be played where money, extra lives, and other items can be collected. After several levels, a boss needs to be defeated, and these bosses include a squid, man-eating plant, a genie, a fire creature, snow man, clown throwing bombs, robot, and a giant alien creature.

    <story>This game is about the same style as the Bomberman Series. The principal game functions are that you, as either Wario or Bomberman walk around on a level and try to blow up your opponent. By blowing up blocks that are blocking your way you can uncover power-ups, that can give you three abilities- 1) The bombs get a longer blast. 2) You can place more bombs at once. 3) You get invulnerable but are also unable to place bombs. Every power-up except for the third one works during the entire round and can be increased by picking up more power-ups of the same type. In the single-player game, you fight as Wario against different amounts of Bombermen, and at the forth course of every world you face a boss. In multiplayer, you play as either Wario or Bomberman, and try to blow up your friend / enemy.</story>

    <story>Wario, Mario&apos;s greedy rival from Super Mario Land 2- 6 Golden Coins, is more determined than ever to get a castle after being booted out of Mario&apos;s. He has heard that the pirates of Kitchen Island have a golden Statue of Princess Toadstool that&apos;s worth a king&apos;s ransom! Wario figures that if he swipes the Princess&apos; statue for himself, as well as all the other loot the pirates have hoarded, he&apos;ll have more than enough cash for a castle that&apos;s even bigger and better than Mario&apos;s! Wario Land- Super Mario Land 3 is different from previous games in the series in that you control the brutish and greedy Wario. Even when small, Wario can break most bricks with a punch, and some enemies are so weak to him that they&apos;ll just be pushed aside! Wario has a body slam attack that he can use to destroy enemies, and he can also pick them up and throw them at his foes. If that wasn&apos;t enough, there are three different power ups that Wario can find. The Bull Hat lets him plough through bricks in a single hit, ram his horns into the ceiling to hold onto it, and butt stomp to stun all enemies. The Jet Hat allows him to fly horizontally for a short period of time, and increases his jump height and speed. Finally, the Dragon Hat allows him to breathe a long stream of fire for a short period of time. To suit Wario&apos;s greedy nature, the game revolves around money. Throughout the stages, you can earn coins by grabbing them floating in the air, punching them out of bricks, or by body slamming into foes and then collecting the coins they drop. You can also find hidden treasures buried deep within some levels by finding a key and then throwing it at the skull door to unlock it. Once Wario reaches the end of a level, he usually needs to pay a toll to get the end-of-level door to open. Pressing Up on the Control Pad and B pulls out a coin worth 10 coins, which you must throw at the door. Once the door opens, you can exit and the level is complete. Before you finish each level, you can choose to play a mini-game that doubles or halves the amount of coins you have, with a 50/50 chance. You get three tries, and can choose to leave whenever you wish...so don&apos;t get too greedy!</story>

    <story>Seeking revenge on Wario after he stole their treasure in Wario Land- Super Mario Land 3, special agents from the Black Sugar Gang of Kitchen Island sneak into Wario&apos;s newly built castle, steal back the treasure, and leave the castle and the surrounding area a mess. As Wario, you must clean the place up and take back what you now call your own. In a change from the original Wario Land, Wario is now immortal, to a certain point. Instead of dying when hit by an enemy, Wario loses the coins he collected along his travels in each level. And he can also turn into other Warios. For example, if he is hit by a bee, Wario puffs up into a giant ball of air, and floats up to the top of the level. Only when hit by a sharp object will he return to normal. There are other types, like Fire Wario and Zombie Wario, and each can have its advantages, like getting to other areas otherwise unreachable, or they can halt your progress.</story>

These nine wrestlers consist of Rick Rude, Ron Simmons, Steve Austin, Sting, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, Big Van Vader and The Steiner Brothers (Rick &amp; Scott). The gameplay is similar to the many others with a side scrolling look where players can either punch or kick their opponents or climb the ropes and perform a flying maneuver to decimate their opponents. Players also can use their signature move once it has become available to use against their opponent in an attempt to win the match. Players can either compete in a single exhibition match or compete in an Elimination match where they face off against each wrestler in succession for a chance to become WCW World Heavyweight Champion.

    <story>Wheel of Fortune is based on the popular game show produced by Merv Griffin. The goal is the same as the game show, which is to guess missing letters to solve a puzzle which covers the same subjects as found on the show, such as place, person, thing, phrase, etc. Like the game show, the players spin the wheel, select consonants, buy vowels and hopefully, solve the mystery phrase. The wheel can be spun at different strengths by sliding a bar across a selector, and the chances of earning a free spin, losing a turn, and going bankrupt remain. Game play is for up to two players taking turns, or for one player against the computer. Gameplay moves through three rounds, and a bonus round for a grand prize. Winning is accomplished, essentially, by earning the most money and winning the game by solving the phrases. There is even a sexy model that animates out onto the stage--though the resemblance to Vanna White is minimal at best.</story>

    <story>WildSnake is a puzzle game in which the player must manage falling snakes in a confined space and keep the snakes from reaching the top of the space. Snakes fall and slither until they reach a resting spot on the floor of the space. A snake will destroy any other snakes of the same color and pattern that it touches with its head on the way down, which often has the chain effect of loosening the pile of snakes so that all the snakes slither into new positions, possibly eliminating even more snakes. The game is played against a selection of backgrounds including desert, forest, water, or grass. Further, there are 7 game grids including the standard grid (a tall rectangle), X, plus, flask, Diabolo (an hourglass pattern), T-square, and obstacle (with a number of intermediate blocks). The player starts out as a nestling and earns higher and higher distinctions taken from the snake realm (garter snake, water snake, boa, mambo, python, king cobra, etc.) as more snakes are cleared. Also, as the level increases. more types of snake patterns must be handled. Sometimes, there is a flashing red snake that eliminates the first snake it touches. Further, there is occasionally an unstoppable snake that barrels down to the bottom of the space, eliminating all snakes in its path. The game can be played with 1 or 2 players in either easy, normal or hard mode. In the single player mode, the player can choose whether the preview showing the next snake will be shown. In 2-player mode, there is always a preview window. In fact, there is a queue of 3 snakes between the 2 player spaces from which the next snake is drawn. As a bonus during competition, multiple snake eliminations by one player result in obstacles appearing in the space of the opposing player.</story>

Various items that help Kuros on his quest, can be picked up throughout the levels- gems increase the player&apos;s score and grant extra lives, food replenishes some health, a spell of invincebility makes Kuros tempoarily invincible and keys are used to open treasure chests or doors. Kuros can also find additional equipment including a &amp;quot;Shield of Protection&amp;quot; that halves the damage he receives and the &amp;quot;Boots of Jumping&amp;quot; that let him jump higher and fall from high platforms without taking damage.

    <story>World Bowling is a bowling game in which the player has to beat bowling alleys from six different countries (England, China, Japan, Canada, France, USA). To win the game, all alleys have to be beaten in a row with an increasing points requirement (200 to 250) - if the score is missed once, it is back to the beginning. The player can set the weight of the bowling ball- a heavier ball has more power but this goes in turn with a loss of control. It also depends on the chosen player character- the male is better with heavy balls while the female character should use a lighter one. The throw itself is divided into three parts- character position on the alley, control and power. While the first is simply chosen by lining the character up, the latter two are reaction games- a marker goes from left to right (and vice versa) and the player has to hit the button when the marker reaches the desired point. A high value (i.e. the marker is right) in control means that the throw is straight while a high power determines the speed and strength.</story>

    <story>The licensed game of the 1998 Football World Cup held in France from June 10 to July 12. Unlike the Windows, Playstation and Nintendo 64 versions of this title the Game Boy version does not feature official player names. Also this version of the game features a 2D isometric view instead of the 3D graphics of the previously mentioned titles. It uses the same engine and most graphics from the Game Boy version of FIFA 98- Road to World Cup. The game focuses on simple controls, fast playing speed and lots of options.</story>

    <story>For the third World Cup in succession, US Gold had the license to produce the official game. They entrusted Tiertex with the task, who produced a top-down game recreating the full tournament. As well as the 24 teams who qualified for the tournament, other significant footballing nations like England, France and Denmark could be drafted in. The presentation of the menus is largely icon-based, with the official mascot featuring prominently. Tackling is difficult and passing is easy, making for a flowing end-to-end style of play.</story>

    <story>Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around. Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack- the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends. There&apos;s a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders. There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.</story>

    <story>One of the first wrestling games for the Nintendo 64, and one of the many for the Playstation. The Playstation version has better, CD quality music, but has less features. One of the main attractions was that WWF&apos;s Steve Austin did a lot of voice acting for it, although the other wrestlers don&apos;t have nearly as much speech. Features include custom player made wrestlers, as well as the real wrestlers, many different game types (single player, multiplayer, royal rumbles, cage matches, etc.), but the career mode is where the action is, and you can build up your wrestlers strengths, and earn him belts.</story>

Each group of enemies you destroy grants you a cash reward and every once in a while you enter Colin&apos;s Bargain Basement, where you can use this cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed &amp; health upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up during the levels. The first part of the game has an organic feel to it, while the second part of the game features mechanical enemies. As there are some maze-like sections with dead-ends in the game, your spaceship scrolls backwards when you keep pressing the down key. A typical Bitmap Brothers smash, the game is also famous for its soundtrack by British electronica group Bomb The Bass.</story>

The events are presented in an isometric or side-scrolling view with the exception of bob-sleighing which uses an third person 3D view from just behind the sleigh.</story>

    <story>Jellystone National Park is in trouble and it is up to Yogi Bear to save the day. The money needed to keep the park up and running for the winter has been stolen by an evil ghost named Jake, determined to shut down the park and has hidden them in 12 safes throughout the park. The player must travel to six different locations to locate these safes (a forest, a pirate ship, the big city, an underground cavern, the old west and a final showdown with Jake). The gameplay is fairly simply, using Yogi the player can travel from left to right and right to left on the screen and to kill certain enemies they must jump on them. Some enemies, however, can&apos;t be killed and must be avoided since Yogi has no weapons to harm them and avoid various pitfalls and hazards as well. There are no true power-ups, instead there are picnic baskets scattered throughout the stage that when the player picks up a 100 of them will get an extra life. Likewise, there are icons labeled 1-UP that will give the player and can pick items to refill their health. There are also hidden doors and areas that the player must find in order to locate the various safes. When the player enters these safes they must collect the 25 gold coins to get a bar of gold, collecting 12 of these gold bars will give Yogi the money needed to win the game.</story>

    <story>Fast-paced action-puzzle game where the player eliminates colored shapes that are approaching his alter ego, another colored shape, before they reach the top, ala Tetris. In order to eliminate the other shapes, you must point your piece at it and &apos;fire&apos;. If the shape is the same color as your piece, the shape is eliminated, as well as all of the shapes of the same color behind it, until your piece hits a piece of a different color. If the shape is of a different color, or it is hit when collecting a line of similar shapes, your piece exchanges colors with the shape.</story>
