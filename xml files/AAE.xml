Each Wireway is taken on in turn, and has a network of lines guiding the movement paths of both yourself and the aliens. You remain on the outside and keep shooting as the aliens move towards you. Any that reach the outside are fatal to touch, thus limiting your range of movement greatly if 2 or more achieve this. Some aliens move sideways - in dealing with these, plan ahead allowing for the time your shots to take to travel.</story>

    <story>A Deluxe version of Atari&apos;s original Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe swaps the vector graphics for bitmaps. The basic gameplay is still the same- You fly your triangular ship around a space which wraps around the edges, filled with asteroids. Shooting the asteroids splits them into two smaller ones, until they are small enough to be destroyed. If you collide with an asteroid, you&apos;re dead, unless you activate your forcefield which will bounce the ship off the asteroids. Sometimes, a flying saucer flies through the screen, shooting everywhere. Additional asteroid shapes also show up, such as the blue target-seeking hexagons which split up into smaller triangular missiles.</story>

Long ago, the Vaxxian Empire overran the galaxy and enslaved most of humanity. Only a few scientists escaped. While the Empire has largely decayed, their robot-controlled space stations still keep humanity enslaved. You need to set the reactors of these stations to destruct. This game is part space shooter and part platformer. You begin the game in your ship, fighting through a space stations defenses. In the first couple levels, these are just drones you must shoot out of your way. In later levels, this defense is a maze of energy walls. Spinning drones create the walls. You can shoot the drones to prevent them from completing some walls. After that, you travel up through the maze, the walls of which are deadly to the touch. You can shoot a wall out of your way, however, this requires lots of shots and you are constantly moving forward. You can only move left and right and fire. After you have breached the defenses, you must guide your ship left and right to successfully land on the stations landing pad. Next, the game becomes a platform game. Your fire button is now a jump button. Following the direction of the red arrows, make your way to the reactor and touch it. You now have a limited time to make your way back to your ship and escape. You have a shield that can get you past an enemy but there is only one per station.</story>

    <story>This is a remake of a Bally-Midway arcade game. You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy Droid ships that attack you. Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too. The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern. There is no end to this game. Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels. You control a small triangle that is your ship. The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire. Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters. While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward. Bouncing also comes into play during movement. When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces. You don&apos;t have control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.</story>

The gameplay is similiar to Asteroids in that you have one screen of space that wraps back on itself and your ship can only thrust and fire. However, whereas in Asteroids you faced pieces of rock that couldn&apos;t give chase, Space Fury instead provides alien vessels that will hunt you down. Each alien vessel starts in 4 pieces at diagonal corners which will try to join together. Shooting any of these pieces before is possible and will make things easier for your player. When one or more pieces reaches the center point, it combines with other pieces there and begins to fire upon and give chase to your vessel. There&apos;s only one screen of space, so your tactics are limited. However your vessel is not completely basic. Provided from the beginning are three superstructures, of which you can choose one, that provide additional firepower to your ship.</story>

Of course it&apos;s not quite that easy... First small sparks will come out of the center trying to hit you. The turret in the center can also launch a very fast, and very accurate, laser at you. On top of that if you destroy a entire circular layer of force field it will regenerate along with another layer! This makes it impossible for you to stay in the same spot, as the layers rotate in opposite directions you will inevitable destroy one before breaching and destroying the center.

    <story>There are five controls which need to be mastered, including a Tempest-like rotary knob for directing the course of the ship, a Phasers button which shoots limited range phasers, an Impulse button for forward motion at slow speed, a Photon Torpedo button that fires torpedoes capable of wiping out large portions of the galaxy and a Warp button that allows forward motion at super speed. The Photon Torpedo and Warp buttons are placed at an awkward position which may take some time to get used to. The game play involves a simulation of the powers and perils of piloting the Enterprise against The Klingon Empire. You have only one ship to command. If it is destroyed, the game is over. At the beginning of the game, you are given a certain number of shields and photons and during the game play, you can gain additional shields, photons, and warp power by docking with a Starbase. When your ship is hit, you lose a shield. If you run out of shields, the next hits will take out your photon torpedos, and next your warp power, and finally your ship, thus completing the simulation. There are six different enemies, including red, purple, and white Klingon ships, blue anti-matter saucers and the tricky yellow Nomad during special rounds, which plants dangerous space mines. The game has 40 different simulation levels, all of where you pilot the Enterprise and try your best to destroy all enemies to protect the Starbases throughout the galaxy.</story>

    <story>Star Wars is a first-person shooter based around the final scenes of the original Star Wars film. It first appeared for arcade coin-operated machines and was subsequently converted to other gaming platforms. You take on the role of Luke Skywalker, aiming to destroy the Death Star. In the first phase you have to pass swarms of TIE Fighters, including dogfighting the one piloted by Darth Vader himself. In the second phase the station&apos;s surface is protected by laser towers, third involves attacking its weakest spot - the unprotected exhaust port - with proton torpedos. Your X-Wing starts with six shields, but more can be awarded for good performance. Complete the game and it loops back around at ever-increasing difficulty.</story>

    <story>Sundance is a puzzle arcade game using vector graphics released by Cinematronics in 1979. The game consists of two grids floating in a pseudo-3D space with small suns bouncing between them. The player scored points by capturing the suns as they made contact with the grids. The player also had a limited-use smart bomb button which would eliminate all of the suns currently bouncing between the grids. As the suns bounced, the grids would move closer and closer, making gameplay more difficult. The game ended when the grids fully converged.</story>

    <story>Enemy airships are approaching your command base! You need to fly your five plane squadron into battle to defend it. You control a squadron of five ships at the bottom of the screen, your goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the various enemies which will be attacking. If one of the ships in your squadron is hit by enemy fire, it will be destroyed. The game ends when all five ships have been destroyed. As you progress through the game, you will occasionally have the chance to replenish missing ships. Everytime you complete a round by shooting ten enemies, an extra ship will float by on the screen. You can add this ship to your squadron by catching it in an empty space in the formation. Every time you complete four rounds, the game will advance to the next level with increased difficulty!</story>

    <story>Tail Gunner is a monochrome vector arcade game created by Vectorbeam in 1979. The premise of the game is that the player is the tailgunner of a large space ship. Enemy spacecraft attack the vessel in groups of three, and the player must aim a set of crosshairs and shoot the enemies before they slip past the player&apos;s cannons. Because of the game&apos;s depicted viewpoint, instead of appearing to fly into the starfield, the stars move toward the center of the screen. In addition to shooting down the enemy ships, the player is also given limited use of a shield that can block ships from passing. The game ends when ten ships slip past the player&apos;s cannon. The game was sold as Tail Gunner II in a sit down cabinet[3] and its controls consisted of a single metal joystick with fire button integrated to the tip.</story>

You remain on the outside and keep shooting as the aliens move towards you. Any that reach the outside are fatal to touch, thus limiting your range of movement greatly if 2 or more achieve this. Some aliens move sideways - in dealing with these, plan ahead allowing for the time your shots to take to travel.</story>

    <story>The first one-on-one fighting game, Warrior was a 2-player overhead sword-fighting contest. Brilliant vector graphics and incredibly beautful backdrop and internal cabinet artwork made the game enthralling to watch, producing more complex images than Atari&apos;s vector hardware was capable of. Unfortunately, the Cinematronics vector system was also far less reliable. Most Cinematronics vector games are rare, and Warrior is rare among them.</story>

    <story>A fixed-screen, overhead shoot &apos;em up featuring a controllable ship with thrust and free rotation capabilities, similar to its predecessor Space Fury (and ultimately to Asteroids/Spacewar!). Your mission- infiltrate and recapture eight cosmic cities, presently held in thrall by a group of eight alien robots. Each of these mechanical antagonists (some male, some female) will taunt you in its synthesized voice as you approach its captured city. Once there, you must power through three waves of defense, consisting of drones and fighters - some enemies may be shielded, requiring multiple laser blasts to take out. Down the screen travel the indestructible Moboids, which come in three flavors (one sends ships into an uncontrollable spin, another bounces them away, and another destroys them on contact); the playfield doesn&apos;t wrap around, and bumping into the surrounding force-field will kick your ship back. Once the defenses are repelled, you will arrive at the city itself, where you&apos;ll face off against its robot conqueror, surrounded by concentric, rotating shields (a-la Star Castle). The robot will lob energy blasts at you as it tries to escape; if you manage to sneak a shot through the openings in its shields, your award is an extra life.</story>
