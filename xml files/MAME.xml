    <story>The game is viewed in a top-down perspective and is vertical scrolling. The player does not select plays for either offense or defense. On offense, the player simply receives the ball upon the snap and either attempt to run with the quarterback, toss the ball to a running back, or throw the ball to the one long distance receiver - basically the option offense. On defense, the player chooses one of two players to control, and the computer manipulates the others. The ball can also be punted or a field goal can be attempted.10-Yard Fight has five levels of difficulty; from easiest to most difficult- high school, college, professional, playoff, and Super Bowl. If the player wins both halves of an accelerated real time 30-minute half at an easier level, the player advanced to the next level of difficulty, like a career mode.</story>

    <story>The game is set in the Pacific theater of World War II, off the coast of the Midway Atoll. The goal is to attack the Japanese Air Fleet that bombed the players&apos; American Aircraft Carrier, pursue all Japanese Air and Sea forces, fly through the 16 levels of play, make their way to the Japanese battleship Yamato and destroy her. 11 Levels consist of an Air-to-Sea battle (with a huge battleship or an aircraft carrier as an End-Level Boss), while 5 levels consist of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese Bombers and a Mother Bomber that needs to be destroyed.As in 1942, players pilot a P-38. Two buttons are used- one for regular attacks (with several weapons) and one for special actions that executes either a loop like in 1942 or one of three special attacks that damage the plane. Unlike 1942, the player only has one life, with one refillable energy meter. Destroying a complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a power-up, such as a health boost or a temporary special weapons which replaces the default twin gun.</story>

The most obvious difference from real baseball is that some of the characters in this game are robots. All the human characters are equipped with powerful armor, computer sensors, and jet-packs for improved offense and defensive skills.</story>

His sprite is like an enlarged version of his sprites from Midnight Wanderers, he shares the same position stance, his trademark jump in which he holds his hand on his hat, and also the same shooting animation. The sprites are recoloured in a more vibrant cartoon-esque style, as opposed to the washed out effect from the games, to match the style of the Marvel vs Capcom series. If two players get Lou, then the second player&apos;s pallette is Green, and is most likely based on Siva&apos;s color clothing from the Midnight Wanderers game. Player two&apos;s firestorm is colored orange.Lou&apos;s Companion Siva, has a character based on him as a tribute, featuring on Capcom&apos;s Cannon Spike game.

    <story>720? is a 1- or 2-player (alternating) skateboard themed game with both competitive and street-style skating action. The player portrays the skater who performs skate maneuvers for points and competes in skate parks for medals. The action takes place in a Skate City where all surfaces are skateable. Players can choose where they want to skate in the city, and which skate parks they want to enter, making each new game a different experience.[-LF-]At the start of each game, players can select one of two play modes. A training game is available for beginning players. In this game, there are numerous playing hints and messages, and the add-a-coin feature is disabled. Experienced players can start off by skating to a higher platform. Fewer game hints are given in this mode, and the add-a-coin feature is offered.[-LF-]Game play starts with the player in the middle of Skate City. Using a new rotary control and a jump and a Kick button, players maneuver around the city trying to score points by performing skillful skate moves. At various score thresholds, skate park tickets are rewarded. These tickets allow entry into one of the skate parks, where players compete against the clock for gold, silver or bronze medals.[-LF-]The player&apos;s main objective is to compete in as many skate parks as possible. In the city streets, players have a limited amount of time to win entry tickets and make their way to a skate park. In addition, there are numerous city hazards which must be avoided such as BMX riders, cars, Frisbee throwers, and other gangs. To guide the player in the city, players find map areas in streets which momentarily display the layout of the city and the location of the skate parks.[-LF-]In 720? there are ten class levels which determine the degree of difficulty in the skate parks and the timer in the streets. Players select the class level in which they want to compete. For instance, at the start of each game, there are four unique skate parks which are located in the outskirts of the city. Each park is a different class ranging from class 1 difficulty, which is the easiest, to class 4 difficulty, the hardest.[-LF-]In 720? players can compete in over 20 different skate parks. Each one requires unique skill moves to qualify for a medal. There are variations of a half-pipe ramp, a downhill; a slalom and a jump park. Each skate park has a distinct music score of its own, creating a different mood for players.[-LF-]In the skate parks, cash prizes arc awarded to players that qualify for a medal. After each skate park competition, the game continues back in the city for more street-style skating. Players can use their cash winnings to buy equipment from various skate shops which are located throughout the city. Skating equipment helps players perform better moves. Boards give faster speed. Helmets allow more risk-taking for successful maneuvers. Pads give faster recovery from falls. Shoes provide more height on jumps and quicker starts. As a reference for locating skate shops and park entrances, players find map areas throughout the city by skating over a map. A layout of the city is momentarily displayed when players skate over a map.[-LF-]In 720? a game ends only when players run out of time in the city. When the timer is running low, a SKATE OR DIE message appears along with a warning in speech. When the timer runs out, killer-bees appear as a final warning. If the player is killed by the bees before entering a skate park, the game is over. Using the add-a-coin feature, players can continue where they left off. 720? has an operator option to select maximum number of add-a-coins allowed. By using the add-a-coin, players can keep any special skate equipment they have acquired in the previous game, as well as all accumulated cash, tickets, points, and medals.</story>

    <story>A futuristically-themed racing game from Sega, in which the player takes on the role of the A.B. Cop; a law enforcement officer who rides a heavily armoured hover-bike and must chase down and destroy the perpetrators of an armed robbery before the time limit expires.[-LF-]At the start of each level, the player&apos;s bike is equipped with a limited number of &apos;Jumps&apos;, which, when utilized, allows the bike to temporarily take to the air; useful in avoiding the many vehicles - both enemy and benign - that litter the tracks. Also, if a jump is timed correctly it&apos;s possible to drop onto and attack enemy targets from above. Blue Jump icons occasionally appear on the track and can be run over and collected.[-LF-]In addition to the jumps, pushing UP on the joystick gives the bike a short speed boost; necessary if the levels are to be completed within the tight time limits the game imposes. Unlike the jumps, the bike has an unlimited number of speed boosts. At the end of each stage awaits a huge, end-of-level guardian - a first for the racing genre - each of which is heavily armed and takes multiple hits to destroy.[-LF-]A.B. Cop is hugely reminiscent of Taito&apos;s superb racing legend, Chase HQ.</story>

    <story>The player selects from a jet fighter or helicopter, shoot enemies in the air and ground, collect power-ups, and defeat bosses to advance levels.The game differs from most others in the genre in that you can change the aircraft you use at the start of each level. The jet fighter always shoots straight forward; power-ups increase the width and strength of its shots. The helicopter fires thinner and weaker shots, but turns in the direction it moves (similar to the later Zero Gunner), giving it great range; powerups increase the strength of shots, as well as the number of bullets per shot (adding a small spread effect to the shot while moving around).Both the fighter and the helicopter also start with three bombs which wipe out everything in their path, including enemy shots. These bombs are also unique compared to similar games, in that they produce a line of small horizontal blasts that can be directed at the line travels across the ground, by pressing left and right (similar to the helicopter&apos;s shots). Additional bombs can be picked up during the course of the game.Losing a life resets your power and bomb count to the amount you start with. Air Duel is a challenging game, and later levels can become nearly unplayable if a single life is lost.</story>

As the series begins, Dr. Moffet and his crew steal Airwolf during a live-fire weapons test. During the theft, Moffet opens fire on the Firm&apos;s bunker, killing a United States Senator and seriously injuring Firm deputy director Michael Coldsmith-Briggs III (codename Archangel). Moffet takes the gunship to Libya, where he begins performing acts of aggression - such as sinking an American destroyer - as a service for military strongman Muammar Gaddafi, who allows Moffet to keep Airwolf on Libyan soil.</story>

Ten years after its original arcade release, it was ported to the Sharp X68000, and it was also included in the fifth volume of the Namco Museum series on the Sony PlayStation. The game&apos;s primary protagonist, Toby Kissy Masuyo, predates by one year Samus Aran from Metroid as a human female playable character, although her face isn&apos;t revealed until she defeats the Octy King at the end.</story>

    <story>Two players control two soldiers named Ricky and Mary, who must fight their way through large eight-way scrolling levels rescuing their comrades who are being held by aliens. After they have rescued a certain number of hostages the exit opens and they can pass through it in order to fight the end-of-level guardian. If this monstrosity is defeated, they move onto the next stage. As well as two player simultaneous gameplay, Alien Syndrome features pick-ups which assist the player including better weapons and maps of the current level.</story>

    <story>The player controls an anteater that elongates his proboscis through maze-like anthills eating ants. The player can only eat ants with the tip of the anteater&apos;s proboscis. If an ant bites your proboscis at any other location you lose a life. Pressing the second button will quickly retract the anteater&apos;s proboscis. Worms will not harm you unless eaten head first, in which case you lose a life. Worms can be safely eaten from behind. Eating queen ants at the very bottom of the nest will temporarily clear all ants and worms from the screen. Once the sun has travelled across the screen and night falls, a spider will appear. The spider climbs down the anteater&apos;s proboscis, taking a life if it touches the tip. The object is to eat all of the larvae before time runs out, clearing the screen. Each larva is worth 10 points. Each ant is worth 100 points, while eating a worm is worth 200 and multiplies the score you receive from eating ants by 1x (Ex. eating 5 ants +2 worms = 500 x 2 = 1000). Queen ants are worth 1,000.</story>

    <story>Aggressors of Dark Kombat offers virtually no storyline to explain its fights. In fact, the prefight conversation sequences show that the fights are not much more than chance meetings. The player&apos;s chosen character will advance through a series of stages fighting a series of opponents because he doesn&apos;t like the way the other guy looks.The game is viewed from the side perspective that virtually all 2D fighting games use. One player can fight against a computer-controlled opponent, or two players can fight against each other. Each character&apos;s life bar appears on the upper left or right of the screen, depending on starting location. A timer is located between the two life bars. When one character is drained of energy or the timer runs out, the match is over and the character left standing (or with more life, if neither characters were drained of energy) wins.</story>

The game&apos;s story focuses on Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia traveling to South Town to rescue Yuri from the clutches of gangsters. In two-player mode, you take on each other in battle by punching and kicking each other while attempting strong-arms. There is even a taunt button. Unique for fighting games of the early &apos;90s, the characters are larger and more detailed in Art of Fighting, and a camera zooms in and out of the action depending on the distance between the fighters.</story>

    <story>The second installment in the AoF series added the rage gauge; similar to the spirit system of its predecessor, it limited the use and effectiveness of special attacks.The game&apos;s story is set a year after the original. Geese Howard, a rising star in South Town&apos;s criminal underworld, calls fighters to the city for a new tournament, The King of Fighters. Howard was the final boss and series villain of SNK&apos;s other fighting game franchise Fatal Fury (though he is a secret boss in this game), whose story took place over a decade after the events of Art of Fighting.Art of Fighting 2 was the only time Yuri Sakazaki was a playable character in the series. It also marked the only time that she donned her trademark outfit, which was made famous in The King of Fighters series. This game also marks the debut of Takuma Sakazaki without his Mr. Karate persona, as well as Eiji Kisaragi, who both appear in the King of Fighters series. Ryuhaku Todo, the first boss in the original AOF, is the only character dropped; all characters are playable from the beginning. The final boss is always Mr. Big, though as mentioned earlier, an extra match will be played against Geese Howard if the player unlocks him through good performance.This game is also notorious for its difficulty, with it being referred in many fighting circles as having some of the toughest opponent AI in a fighting game.</story>

    <story>Arabian is a rarity for Atari&apos;s arcade efforts -- a climber/platform game -- in which players lead a wanna-be Arabian Knight through various locales kicking monsters and birds out of the way before they touch him and cost the player a life. The action begins aboard a ship at sea, and later to an island and then a castle. Urns with letters on them are peppered around the screen and must be touched in the correct order to spell ARABIAN for bonus points -- but beware of a huge genie that occasionally pops out of an urn to grab any adventurers within his grasp. The player&apos;s man can scale ladders and ropes, hang overhead from horizontal ropes, and hop from flying carpet to flying carpet (similar to Frogger&apos;s river logs) to navigate each level.</story>

The player&apos;s ship is always presented in the center of the screen, and as the player moves left and right, the ground actually scrolls in the opposite direction. The player can continue scrolling all the way in one direction and end up back where he or she started.[-LF-]Other new concepts include walls of mazes that float in the air which may be optionally traveled through. Certain ground targets provide power-ups or special weapons, but they must be bombed 3 times in order to earn them. A boss sequence occurs at the end of each stage. The boss has one infrequently exposed weak spot that only takes one bomb to destroy, but the boss will leave after an alloted time if the player does not succeed. There is a landing sequence after the boss fight that must be successfully maneuvered for bonus points. And finally, the ship receives a new weapons at each stage (5 distinct combinations which cycle).[-LF-]The arcade game features 16 levels, the last four of which repeat indefinitely.</story>

The player must once again take control of the Vaus and overcome many challenges in order to destroy DOH once and for all.[-LF-]An update of the popular 1986 original Revenge of Doh sees the player battle through 34 rounds, taken from a grand total of 64. Revenge of Doh differs from its predecessor with the introduction of Warp Gates. Upon completion of a round or when the Break (&apos;B&apos;) pill is caught, two gates appear at the bottom left and bottom right of the play area respectively, the Vaus is then taken through one of the gates - the choice will affect which version of the next round is provided. The fire-button is only used when the Laser (&apos;L&apos;) or Catch (&apos;C&apos;) pill is caught.[-LF-]The game also features two new features for bricks. Notched silver bricks, like normal silver bricks, take several hits to destroy. However, after a short period of time after destruction, they regenerate at full strength. Fortunately, clearing a level does not require that any notched bricks to be destroyed. Also, some bricks move from side to side as long as their left and/or right sides are not obstructed by other bricks.[-LF-]The game features a mini-boss in the form of a giant brain, which will help you practice for DOH. You must aim for the brain&apos;s mouth to defeat it.,</story>

    <story>Your mission is to reclaim your homeland by destroying the enemy forces that have taken over. You have an Assault tank, the supreme mobile weapon. Your tank has artillery guns and grenades, can perform Rapid Rolls to dodge enemy shots, and uses Power Wheelies to launch grenades.[-LF-]Your controls are two 4-position joysticks with triggers. These controls make Assault like no other tank game. You have a quick, highly responsive vehicle with fast movement in all directions. To avoid enemy shots, Rapid Roll your tank left or right by moving both joysticks to the same side. To launch grenades, put the tank in the Power Wheelie position by moving both joysticks to the outside, then pressing either trigger. Your grenades are triple the fire power of your tank&apos;s standard shots.[-LF-]Your tank is always in the center of the screen no matter what direction you are going. With Assault&apos;s 360-degree scrolling playfield, the world rotates around you as you move. An arrow always points you towards the exit to the next level.[-LF-]The lift zone gives you an advantage over the invaders and a spectacular view of the playfield. Each lift zone is a five-sided platform on the playfield that flashes red when you can use it. When you drive onto the lift zone, your tank jets straight up to get a bird?s eye view of the surrounding terrain and enemy lines. From this overhead position, you can reconnoiter enemy forces and bomb enemy outposts.[-LF-]Fight your way through 11 different levels to seek out and destroy the invader?s headquarters. To succeed, you must -[-LF-] Dodge enemy gunfire with the Rapid Roll maneuver.[-LF-] Assault enemy lines with long-range powerful grenades launched from Power Wheelies.[-LF-] Destroy all enemy tanks you encounter to prevent rear attacks.[-LF-] Bomb enemy outposts and reconnoiter enemy emplacements using the lift zones.[-LF-] Protect yourself against enemy artillery using buildings and trees.[-LF-] Blow up the large cannons on each level while you avoid enemy attacks.[-LF-] Follow the arrow to find the exit to the next level. Before you can exit, you must destroy the large cannons defending the enemy strongholds.</story>

    <story>Asteroids Deluxe is an arcade game released in May 1981[1] by Atari Inc. and is the sequel to Asteroids. It was followed by Space Duel in 1982 and Blasteroids in 1987. Key changes in Asteroids Deluxe were designed to combat the saucer-hunting strategy of Asteroids, which allowed experts to play for extended periods.[2] The game is significantly more difficult than the original.[2]Unlike Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe was only ported to one 8-bit system, the BBC Micro in 1984. It was also released for the Atari ST in 1987.[2]</story>

    <story>Asterix is a horizontal-scrolling beat&apos;em up arcade game released in 1992 by Konami. It is based on the French comic series Asterix and Obelix. The player fights as either Asterix the Gaul or his best friend, Obelix, as they take on the &apos;might&apos; of the oppressive Roman Empire. Asterix includes a variety of humorous fighting moves, which are demonstrated in the game&apos;s attract mode. The artwork and feel of Asterix remains true to its French source material, and the game&apos;s many humorous touches (such as the way defeated Legionnaires crawl away) will be instantly familiar to fans of the comic-book and cartoon series. Bonus levels - such as the chariot race that awaits at the end of the first level - introduce different gameplay elements to provide a break from the fighting.</story>

The player controls a triangular-shaped ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. As the ship moves, momentum is not conserved — the ship eventually comes to a stop again when not thrusting. The player can also send their ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen (with the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid).</story>

The player must continuously monitor the onscreen temperature and fuel gauges; if the ship overheats, its weapon is disabled, and if it is depleted of fuel, the vessel itself explodes. The player must battle through waves of enemies, which attack with varied formations and flight patterns. When a wave is destroyed, a new one appears. At the end of each sector, the player flies through an asteroid belt and can obtain extra fuel by shooting fireballs. After this, the mother ship is met, where the player docks and refuels for the next sector.

The player&apos;s task is to eliminate the four successive waves of different types of attacking craft, while avoiding being hit by missiles and bombs, and then refuel by shooting the &apos;GS&apos; ship before repeating the process. The player starts with 3 lives and receives a bonus life on reaching a score of 5000. 300 bonus points are received for shooting each 6 falling bombs and for 950 for hitting the GS ship accurately on the first shot. A very large bonus of 10,000 is given for getting through 4 waves and refueling by using exactly 2 shots more than the minimum needed. As the higher levels of Astro Fighter are difficult to survive consistently, even for the best players, the highest scores have been achieved by the achieving the 10,000 bonus deliberately.</story>

    <story>Ataxx is an abstract strategy board game that involves play by two parties on a seven-by-seven square grid. The object of the game is to make your pieces constitute a majority of the pieces on the board at the end of the game, by converting as many of your opponent&apos;s pieces as possible.Each player begins with two pieces, white and black, for the first player and second player respectively. The game starts with the four pieces on the four corners of the board, with white in the top left and bottom right and black on the other two. White moves first.During their turn, players move one of their pieces either one or two spaces in any direction. Diagonal distances are equivalent to orthogonal distances, e.g. it is legal to move to a square whose relative position is two squares away both vertically and horizontally. If the destination is adjacent to the source, a new piece is created on the empty departure square. Otherwise the piece on the source moves to the destination. After the move, all of the opponent player&apos;s pieces adjacent to the destination square are converted to the color of the moving player. Players must move unless no legal move is possible, in which case they must pass.</story>

    <story>San Drad, California, has been overrun by the Aliens, and the cybernetically-enhanced Major Dutch Schaefer and Lieutenant Linn Kurosawa have been abandoned by their superiors and are cornered by a swarm of the Alien drones. Before they can be killed, a pair of the Predators appear and destroy the Aliens. The Predators offer an alliance with the two humans in order to stop the Alien infestation.The players take control of up to three of four characters- Dutch, Linn, a Predator hunter, and a Predator warrior, and battle the Aliens through several environments. In the process, the characters discover that the Alien presence on Earth is the result of an experiment headed by a renegade General Bush of the U.S. Colonial Marines in conjunction with the Weyland-Yutani corporation. They destroy the Alien hive by crashing a military ship into San Drad, causing a huge explosion. The Predator warrior then gives his wrist blades to Dutch and Linn in recognition of their skills as warriors, before the Predators depart back into space.</story>

    <story>During a walk with his girlfriend, the player is ambushed by agents of a mysterious crime syndicate who take his girlfriend away and shoot him to death. Now, as a wandering spirit with the ability to possess most others, he is summoned by his girlfriend&apos;s father (who researches ghost energy) and is given a mission to save her from the mysterious crime syndicate that holds her hostage, enabling the player to rest in peace.As it turns out, the crime syndicate is also researching ghost energy, and they kidnapped the girl in an effort to force her father to cooperate with them. The player must fight through 6 stages to infiltrate the evil syndicate&apos;s base, collecting three keys on stages 2, 5, and 6. If the player has all three keys upon reaching the final leg of Stage 6, he can open the girl&apos;s cell and possess her to help her fight her way out. If not, he must abandon her and face the syndicate&apos;s leader alone. After the syndicate&apos;s leader is defeated, the base blows up, and the player ends up on a grassy field as his spirit&apos;s power fades. If the player failed to save the girl she [probably] dies in the explosion and [he] expect to see her in afterlife as he fades away. If the player did save her, she comes to on said grassy field, and the player expresses a wish for her future happiness as he vanishes.</story>

When they pull a gun out at you when you open a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot them before they shoot you. If you shoot them too early (ie- before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair, and you won&apos;t score any points, but if you&apos;re too late, he&apos;ll shoot you and you lose one of your three lives.If you waste too much time, a bandit will come out from one of the doors and stick dynamite on it. You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it.If you&apos;re lucky, either a man or a woman will throw you a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. More often than not, the person will throw his/her hands up, saying I haven&apos;t got anything. That&apos;s when they will be replaced by bandits.Some men will carry three to five pieces of gold on top of their heads, and shooting at all of the gold will award you with a bag of gold coins. Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the rope, there&apos;s more money for you, because not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you&apos;ll get three bags of gold coins.</story>

    <story>Batsugun (バツグン Batsugun?) is a vertically scrolling shoot &apos;em up video game created by the now-defunct Japanese game developer Toaplan. The title translates to exceptional or extraordinary.Originally developed for the arcade, Batsugun was first released in 1993. A second edition named Batsugun Special Version was shown at the AOU (Arcade Operators Union) show in Japan but was never released as Toaplan slid into bankruptcy. After Toaplan&apos;s bankruptcy, the Special Version appeared on the secondhand market. The two revisions were released on the Sega Saturn in 1996 as a single package coded by Toaplan offshoot Gazelle.Heralded by some as the first manic shooter, Batsugun&apos;s development involved employees who would go on to form and work at Cave and continue to work in this subgenre. This includes the game&apos;s chief programmer Tsuneki Ikeda. Batsugun saw an evolution in the use of complex enemy wave and bullet patterns, and player firepower and hit-box.The Special Edition featured a number of changes including a smaller hitbox, a shield protecting the player from one hit, more powerful bombs, new scoring items, and the addition of multiple game rounds or loops of increasing difficulty.The Saturn releases are nearly the same but differ from the arcade versions in subtle ways, including rearranged music and lack of slowdown in some cases which can make the game more difficult.</story>

    <story>This game was 2-player only, you must have a live human opponent to play against, or else the other players mouse (the games promotional material said the character was a mouse), will go straight into a wall, making for a very quick and boring game. Each player moves their mouse around leaving a solid line behind them. All moves are made on an invisible grid, so you can only turn at 90 degree angles. Scattered around the gameboard are several &apos;fee&apos; that you must avoid, as hitting a foot is just like smashing into a wall or a line. To win you must last longer than your opponent before hitting something (first person to hit something loses). One good strategy is to try and box your opponent in to a small section of the screen, and then just move carefully until they crash. Pushing backwards on the stick will cause you to crash into your own line, so avoid that at all cost.</story>

    <story>Bio-ship Paladin, known in Japan as Space Battleship Gomora (宇宙戦艦ゴモラ?), is a 1990 horizontally scrolling shoot &apos;em up arcade game. It was later ported to the Sega Mega Drive. While the game is essentially a standard horizontally scrolling shoot &apos;em up, it has an innovation that makes it unique in the genre. The player flies a spaceship (specifically, a bioship) which has the standard forward guns to be found in all horizontal scrollers, but it also possesses a weapon that can be manually targeted with a crosshair, in the same manner as in the game Missile Command. This allows the player to fire in any direction with pinpoint accuracy, and adds an extra level of strategy to the game. The game saw an almost arcade perfect port on the Sega Mega Drive. What few changes there were actually enhanced the look of the game such as added parallax scrolling backgrounds in level 2.</story>

    <story>The planet Raguy was once a beautiful place, until the evil Daruma tribe invaded, bringing pollution that corrupted the land. You, as Blue, are a specialist of the Leaf Dump, and you love Princess Fa of the Raguy family. Unfortunately, Princess Fa has fallen sick from the pollution. It&apos;s your job to save your princess in Blue&apos;s Journey, a 2D side-scrolling platformer with RPG elements. Go through stages jumping on platforms and avoiding traps, while dealing with a multitude of bad guys, with a special bad guy boss at the end of every level to defeat with special means. To help with this, Blue can use a leaf attack and shrink. The leaf attack, only used when Blue is full sized, lets Blue slam a leaf that stuns any enemies he hits. Blue can also pick up power-ups for a more devastating leaf attack, or change his attack entirely. When the enemies are stunned, Blue can pick them up and throw them across the screen to dispose of more baddies. Shrunken down Blue can&apos;t use his attacking power, but he can fit into small crevasses and crannies not normally accessible. Of course, Blue can also dispatch enemies by jumping on them. Since Raguy&apos;s economy is flower based, Blue can collect flowers to buy things at special huts. But Blue must take care not to fall into traps or bottomless pits, which cause instant death. Being hit by bad guys or their shots is just as bad. Blue starts the game with two hearts, losing one when he gets whacked by a bad guy. When his heart count goes to zero, Blue dies. Play the game alone (as Blue), or with your friend (as a green Blue) for two-player simultaneous fun.</story>

    <story>Sometime in their past, the planets Remuria and Mutras started an interplanetary war that showed no sign of ending. The endless fight between the human-like inhabitants of the two planets had gone so long that weapon development moved into dangerous territory- Organic Weapon Production combined with alien technology. Soon, a sentient weapon - Brawshella - was born. Brawshella gathered all animal life on both planets and forced them to do its bidding and attack the humans. In a week, the humans were assimilated by Brawshella.Yet, once they were assimilated, they found no other purpose in life but to continue fighting each other. After a while, four of the assimilated fighter pilots regained their consciousness and remembered their pasts. Upon discovering their humanity, the pilots were conflicted with following Brawshella&apos;s orders or fighting it to fully regain their independence. The pilots finally turn against the machine in a battle to rediscover themselves and reclaim their planets.</story>

Each player moves their character around leaving a solid line behind them. All moves are made on an invisible grid, so you can only turn at 90 degree angles. To win you must last longer than your opponent before hitting something (first person to hit something loses).

    <story>The Mega War, fought centuries ago, left the earth in global ruins. Thedestructive nuclear horrors unleashed upon the planet and its populationcreated uncountable amounts of death and devastation. In the wake of thissweeping havoc arose the planet itself to retaliate against the violenceforced upon it. Polar shifts and massive earthquakes swallowed entirecontinents. From seething seas and walls of water arose angry volcanoes,spewing flame and death into the sky. Hungry fires, searing blizzards, andbrutal storms ran rampant across the planet&apos;s surface for years, in an attemptto wash away the man-made horrors that it was forced to endure. At last the earth settled into a new pattern, starting to find somesemblance of balance and peace. The global changes had left a much harsherplanet, and the remaining life forms adapted slowly to the new environment.The Earth&apos;s land masses, altered by man-made weaponry and ended throughelemental means, had evolved into ten isolated provinces. The remainingpopulations within these new provinces found life difficult at first, butslowly evolution and natural selection allowed the human race to adapt andonce again gain control of their destiny. Some of the provinces had strongnatural forces, exposed through the abrupt upheaval, and the resourcefulpost-humans began to master these new powers. Other provinces continued todevelop through the use of science and technology, creating elaborate lifesupport systems and protection against the harsh environments. As the years progressed, eight of the provinces began to communicate andtrade together. An alliance was formed and a global quasi-government wasestablished. The social structure evolved into a mixture of medievalpractices, hybrid technology, and barbarism and barter. Centuries have passed and the present day Earth finds mankind again at thebrink of savagery and destruction. Life is now a series of hardships,deceptions, and lies for the members of the Provincial Alliance. The frozentundra of Polaria and the volcanic Scorch are very close to all out war,halted only by the desolate, radioactive Death Zone that separates them. TheDeath Zone, once a founding member of the Planet Alliance, has remained silentfor almost two centuries, hiding behind the mysterious and deadly red miststhat define its borders. Obsel, the desert province, has been taken over bydesperate and brutal female terrorists. The Ebony Coast, known for its tradeand bartering systems, is now led by a mysterious and greedy leader whom noone trusts, yet all must tolerate. The people of Cyberia, a land inhabitableonly through technological means, have re-engineered their population, and arelosing their humanity to the machine. With tensions running high, the Planet Alliance is beginning to falter andthe provinces are no longer considered allies. And now the High Emperor, theone guiding force that all provinces had agreed to abide by, has beenmysteriously and horribly murdered. The ancient Provincial Agreement declares that a new ruler must be chosenthrough combat between the rulers of each province. Each province will comeprepared for battle with their own Gauntlet of Ascension, a gloved weapon thatonly those in power may don. These ancient gauntlets are treasured andrevered by their people, for they are the foremost symbol of power and honoreach province can have. But it is painfully clear that this tournament will not have the honor ofprevious BloodStorm contests. There have even been rumors that the combatantswill bring back the Sunder Attack, a brutal combat move that separated theopponent&apos;s legs from his body without killing him. This horrible andhumiliating maneuver has never been officially banned from the BloodStormcontest, yet it is so brutal and degrading that no honorable combatant hasused it for centuries. However, these champions from radically differentprovinces are blind to the mysterious evil that surrounds the High Emperor&apos;sdeath, and instead only see their opportunity for personal gain, provincialexpansion, or race domination and will do anything to achieve their goals. The BloodStorm is about to begin!</story>

    <story>The gameplay of Blood Warrior is quite similar to many of the 2D fighting games of the same era. However, Kaneko seem to have taken much of their inspiration from the Mortal Kombat franchise in terms of over the top gore and violence; however, Blood Warrior&apos;s predecessor Shogun Warriors predates Mortal Kombat in featuring blood, while Barbarian- The Ultimate Warrior predates Mortal Kombat in featuring death moves.</story>

    <story>The Player controls a spaceship viewed from above in a 2D representation of space, by rotating the ship, and using thrust to give the ship momentum. To slow down or completely stop moving, the player has to rotate the ship to face the direction it came from, and generate the right amount of thrust to nullify its momentum. The ship has a limited amount of fuel to generate thrust with. This fuel comes in the form of Energy that is also used for the ship&apos;s Shields which protect it against collisions and enemy fire. Once all Energy is gone, the player&apos;s ship is destroyed. The ship can shoot to destroy asteroids and enemy ships. The ship can also be transformed at will into 3 different versions, namely the Speeder, the fastest version, the Fighter, which has the most firepower, and the Warrior, which has extra armour.</story>

    <story>The player controls Jack, a superhero who can leap and glide. Someone has planted 24 bombs at famous tourist sites (the Sphinx and Great Pyramids, the Acropolis, Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, and two cityscapes resembling Miami Beach and Hollywood, which appear only as screen backgrounds rather than unique game locations). Jack must fly around the screen to collect the bombs. Each screen uses a different configuration of platforms upon which Jack may run and jump. Eventually, the levels reoccur a number of times with increasing difficulty.Jack defuses the bombs by simply touching them. As soon as he has touched the first, he triggers a sequence in which another bomb&apos;s fuse lights up, and so on. A player can score a bonus in each round by touching 20 or more bombs in the correct lit-fuse sequence. Jack may also defuse an unlit bomb by touching it, but this impedes his opportunity to score the bonus for that screen. It also delays the appearance of the game&apos;s bonuses and power-ups.</story>

    <story>The object of Bosconian is to score as many points as possible by destroying enemy bases and ships. The player controls a small fighter ship that can move in eight directions and can fire both forward and backward. Each level consists of a number of green space stations that must all be destroyed to advance to the next level (a semi-transparent mini-map helps identify their location). Each station consists of six cannons arranged in a hexagon, surrounding a central core. The player must either destroy all six cannons or shoot the core to destroy a station, and in later levels the core is capable of defending itself.Additionally, the player must avoid or destroy asteroids, mines, and a variety of enemy missiles and ships that attempt to collide with the player&apos;s ship. Enemies occasionally launch formation attacks — destroying the leader causes all remaining enemies to disperse, but destroying all enemies in a formation scores extra bonus points. A spy ship (worth a random bonus value) also appears occasionally, which must be destroyed or the enemies will go berserk.</story>

    <story>Boulder Dash (バルダーダッシュ Barudā Dasshu?), originally released in 1984 for Atari 8-bit computers,[1] is a series of computer games released for the Apple II, MSX, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and ColecoVision home computers, and later ported to the NES, BBC Micro and Acorn Electron, PC, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, Intellivision and many other platforms. It was created by Peter Liepa and Chris Gray, and on October 28, 1983, acquired and later published by First Star Software, which still owns the rights to the game. Boulder Dash inherits numerous gameplay features from the earlier 1982 arcade game The Pit, by Japanese developer Taito.The game&apos;s protagonist is called Rockford.[2] He must dig through caves collecting gems and diamonds and reach the exit within a time limit, while avoiding various types of dangerous creatures as well as obstacles like falling rocks and the constant danger of being crushed or trapped by an avalanche, or killed by an underground explosion.The Commodore 64 version of the first game was also re-released on the Virtual Console in Europe on September 19, 2008, and in North America on June 1, 2009, but was removed from the service in 2013.On January 21, 2014, FirstStar Software and TapStar Interactive announced Boulder Dash - 30th Anniversary Edition, a freemium mobile title developed by SoMa Play Inc. for Android and iOS.</story>

    <story>This game has 3 different bowling variations to choose from &apos;Regulation Bowling&apos;, &apos;Flash-O-Matic&apos;, and &apos;BlackJack&apos; -[-LF-] In &apos;Regulation Bowling&apos; the rules and scoring are just like real bownling, following the regulations of the American Bowling Congress (ABC). In all three games players can join in at any time during the first frame.[-LF-] &apos;Flash-O-Matic&apos; is a variation on the bowling theme. In this game a flashing score value moves back and forth across the alley. The player bowls, and the score value stops when the ball first hits a pin. If the player throws a strike he receives that score value. If he gets a spare he gets half the original value. If he fails to convert the spare then he gets 1 point for each pin that he did knock down. Scores can go up to nearly 10,000 points![-LF-] In &apos;BlackJack&apos; each player gets up to 3 throws to attempt to knock down 21 pins. Each time the full rack of ten pins is set. All pins knocked down by all players in one frame are added to the pot. The player who gets closest to 21 without going over gets all the points in the pot, and the pot is cleared to zero for the next frame. If a player gets 21 exactly then he gets twice the value in the pot. If 2 or more players tie in a frame they each get the points from the pot (or twice the points if they each have 21). Players who do not get closest to 21 or who bust (go over 21) get no points for the frame. Knocking down one pin scores as an ace, and is worth one or eleven, depending on what the player needs. his game is best played by several players together. The more players, the more points each frame is worth!</story>

There was no shortage of martial artists who entered the tournament seeking fame, and yet there were many who left the tournament as corpses. The last challenger who remains in this lawless tournament gets to challenge the organizer of the tournament, the Head of the Huang Financial Clique, for the chance to win the massive prize money. The martial artist who can manage to defeat him will obtain the honor of truly calling him or herself the strongest. However, none of the martial artists who were chosen to challenge the champion in a private final match have ever come back alive. Nobody knows when exactly the tournament is held, since only an avaricious will was spiraling over there. The sponsor is actually an evil spirit who possessed the body of a modern man from Hong Kong who has established a selection system to amplify his dark powers. The FIST tournament has gathered numerous participants from around the globe and another sacrifice will be chosen this year.</story>

Revenge makes adjustment to the character balance by weakening the previously overpowered Condor and removing Sho&apos;s infinite combo from the first game. However, the opening intro is almost identical to that of the first game and game&apos;s graphics are not that different; however, the lifebars were modified to look different compared to the first game&apos;s lifebars, while some stages&apos; graphics were removed (e.g. flags in Sho Kamui&apos;s stage).</story>

    <story>The streets are not safe anymore for law-abiding folk to walk and go about their business in peace. The police can&apos;t stop the gangs so you and two other friends have decided enough is enough and will try to stop seven gangs by finding and killing their leaders. The game is a beat-em-up and it is viewed from the side at an elevated angle. You start outside your shop for each level and following a set path you find and kill the leader of each gang while beating up thugs with your fists and feet or any weapons you find along the way. The screen scrolls in various directions when you move and there are various thugs with just their fists or various weapons like bats, guns and grenades. Some thugs when killed leave power-ups behind like invincibility, bombs or speed and you can pick up a weapon they were carrying. Three players can play on the screen at one time.</story>

    <story>The object of the game is to complete a number of hamburgers while avoiding enemy foods.When main protagonist, chef Peter Pepper, the player&apos;s character, walks the length of an ingredient (bun, meat patty, tomato, etc.), it falls one level. If it lands atop another ingredient, the latter in turn falls one level. A burger is completed when all vertically aligned ingredients have been dropped out of the maze and onto a waiting plate. Once all burgers are completed, the game level is finished.While making burgers, the player must avoid the antagonists, three types of enemies- Mr. Hot Dog, Mr. Pickle, and Mr. Egg. Enemies can be dodged, stunned, crushed with a falling ingredient, or dropped by luring them onto an ingredient and then causing it to fall. In this last case, the piece will fall two extra levels for every enemy caught on it. Enemies that have been crushed or dropped return to the maze after a few seconds. Dropped enemies award larger point values than crushed ones; therefore, to obtain a high score, the player must attract more than one enemy onto an ingredient just before dropping it.Peter Pepper has pepper shots to shake on nearby enemies to stun and render them harmless for a few seconds. Extra shots are obtained by collecting bonus foods, such as coffee, an ice cream cone, or French fries, which appear in the center of the maze when a certain number of ingredients have dropped.There are six screens of increasing difficulty, with more burgers and enemies, burgers that have more parts, and/or layouts that make it easier for Peter Pepper to be cornered and harder for him to reach the ingredients. Completing all six screens takes the player back to the first one.</story>

After the player wins against the opponent, the player will face against other opponents that use other fighting styles in the K-Road Tournament. If the player loses, the game will only allow the player to continue fighting through it with the character he used, and will not allow the player to choose another character.The gameplay has a 6-button layout, but with command inputs different compared to ones in most fighting games released at the time. There are three punches and kicks for a few directions (weak, medium and strong).

    <story>The third and final arcade outing for Bub and Bob (not counting the &apos;Puzzle Bobble&apos; series) Bubble Memories returns once more to the classic, single-screen gameplay of the series&apos; legendary first outing. Graphically, the game is very similar to &apos;Bobble Bobble II&apos;, released a year earlier; the only real visual difference between the two is the latter game&apos;s use of some rather charmless digitized animal photographs that form the game&apos;s backdrops.[-LF-]One new gameplay addition, however, is the introduction of &apos;Super Bubbles&apos;; There are now two sizes of bubble. Hold down the bubble button for about 1 second until you glow to produce a giant bubble. This giant bubble can trap either a single large enemy, or several smaller enemies. This replaces the &apos;Multiple Bubble&apos; facility of the previous game in the series; &apos;Bubble Bobble II&apos;.,</story>

    <story>Bubbles is an action game with puzzle elements where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The object is to clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering the bubble over ants, crumbs, and grease to absorb them. The bubble will grow larger the more objects it absorbs. The player is impeded by enemies—brushes, razor blades, roaches, and sponges—that are deadly to the character. Except for razors, enemies also compete with the player to absorb objects in the sink. Once the bubble reaches a certain size, it will acquire a smiling face and become invulnerable against brushes and sponges; contact with those will reduce the bubble&apos;s size to the point it becomes vulnerable again. After all the objects are gone, the player will progress to the next level if the bubble is large enough. If the bubble is not large enough at that point, or if the player enters the drain while the bubble&apos;s too small, a life is lost. Once the bubble becomes large enough, the drain in the center of the sink will begin to flash green, signaling the player to enter it to progress to the next level.</story>

    <story>Bubble Bobble II is the first direct sequel to Taito&apos;s 1986 platform classic Bubble Bobble (&apos;Rainbow Islands&apos; was the first official sequel, but played very differently) in which one or two players take on the role of the infamous bubble-blowing dinosaurs who must once again fight their way through a large number of single-screen platform-based levels, trapping monsters with their bubbles before bursting them to destroy the trapped enemies.[-LF-]While Bubble Bobble II plays identically to its predecessor, several new changes and additions have been made to breathe new life into the classic gameplay. As well as new bonuses, weapons, enemies and characters, players can now create &apos;Multiple Bubbles&apos;; if the player holds the button down for a few seconds before releasing, up to three bubbles are produced at once.[-LF-]Other gameplay changes include Boss encounters that occur every five to ten levels. These boss screens are part of a new &apos;branching level&apos; structure; once a boss is defeated, players chose to enter one of two doors to determine what level set they tackle next.[-LF-]In addition to Bubble Bobble&apos;s original heroes, Bub and Bob, two new selectable female characters have been added, called Kululun and Cororon. Each of the four dinosaurs possess different gameplay attributes, which are as follows -[-LF-] Bubblun - Average[-LF-] Bobblun - Faster speed[-LF-] Kululun - Bubbles float the furthest[-LF-] Cororon - Bubbles float the fastest[-LF-]Bubble Bobble II&apos;s graphics are, inevitably, a vast improvement over the original game; with lush, colourfully rendered backgrounds and detailed, smoothly animated sprites doing full justice to Bubble Bobble&apos;s legendary characters. The game also features cameo appearances by a number of characters from many other Taito classics.[-LF-]Bubble Bobble II features multiple endings.,</story>

Like a certain moon-sized space station, the Planet of Zoom devastates everything in its path. The Planet of Zoom is controlled by a source ship. Destroying the ship liberates the Planet of Zoom, saving Earth in the process.The game has only eight stages (sectors), with the mothership as the final (and only) boss. Clearing the game puts you on the next loop, with the message NICE PLAY, GO ON. The arcade actually displays how many loops you&apos;ve run (labeled as rounds) as well.At the start of the game (and at each loop), the source ship you fight at the end zooms past, and leaves a missile in its wake. It&apos;s flying higher than you can shoot so you can&apos;t damage it at all.</story>

    <story>This video game is based on the cartoon television series Bucky O&apos;Hare and the Toad Wars under license from Hasbro, Inc. While it is generally classified as a scrolling fighting game, utilizing a Final Fight-esque landscape, the player&apos;s character is also armed with a laser gun, adding in elements of a scrolling shooter. However, if the character is extremely close to an enemy, he will throw out his fists to attack - a precursor to the characters featured in Metal Slug, who use knives in close combat.Much like the cartoon, Bucky O&apos;Hare features colorful animation, and voice actors from the series were hired to participate in the game&apos;s cut scenes.The player chooses from five protagonists- Bucky O&apos;Hare, the heroic rabbit captain of the space ship Righteous Indignation; Jenny, an Aldebaran cat and telepath; Dead-Eye Duck, a four-armed mallard; Willy, a kid from earth that replaced their engineer, and Blinky, a one-eyed android. As in the television series, the characters must stop the Toad Empire from invading extraterrestrial planets and enslaving their peoples; to do so they must shoot their way through an army of brainwashed toads to destroy their evil leader, a computer program known as Komplex and release the Interplanetary Life Force.The enemies, among them Al Negator, Toadborg, Total Terror Toad, a Cyborg Spider, the various varieties of Toad Storm Troopers, the Toads&apos; Air Marshall, and Komplex-2-Go who featured in the comic book and cartoon series continuities.</story>

    <story>Atari&apos;s Battlezone is a 1-player game with an X-Y or vector-generation monitor. The game depicts a first-person view from inside a tank. The battles are fought in a large valley that is completely surrounded by mountains and volcanoes. The valley floor contains pyramids and boxes that can provide temporary protection for players (these cannot be destroyed by shots).[-LF-]The enemy consists of slow and fast &apos;super&apos; tanks and intelligent missiles - all of which become more evasive as the game progresses. In addition, flying saucers appear periodically. These don&apos;t shoot at players, but players can get very high point scores for shooting them.[-LF-]The game starts with the slow tank visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of either type of tank or the missile by reading the messages in the upper left corner of the screen. For example, ENEMY TO RIGHT may be displayed. In addition, the sweeping radar display shows a dot for the enemy&apos;s location, accompanied by a sonar &apos;blip&apos; sound.[-LF-]The upper pie-shaped area on the radar represents the player&apos;s range of view on the screen below. If the enemy falls within this area, it will be shown on the screen below and will be accompanied by the message ENEMY IN RANGE.[-LF-]Occasionally the flying saucer appears on the screen. It is a harmless observer to the battle and will not destroy the enemy or player. Its position is never shown on the radar, but players can earn points for shooting it down. The saucer does act as a distraction, though, since it usually appears at the same time as the enemy tanks or missile. Saucers can be shot down by the player as well as enemy tanks.</story>

    <story>Cabal offers one player and two-player-simultaneous modes of gameplay. Each player assumes the role of an unnamed commando trying to destroy several enemy military bases. There are 5 stages with 4 screens each. The player starts with a stock of three lives and uses a gun with limitless ammunition and a fixed number of grenades to fend off enemy troops and attack the base. The commando is seen from behind and initially starts behind a protective wall which can be damaged and shattered by enemy fire. To stay alive, the player needs to avoid enemy bullets by running left or right, hiding behind cover, or using a dodge-roll. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structures (which collapse rather than shatter) are brought down. When the enemy gauge is emptied, the level is successful completed, all of the remaining buildings on screen collapse, and the player progresses to the next stage. If a player is killed, he is immediately revived at the cost of one life or game overs if he has no lives remaining. Boss fights, however, restart from the beginning if the only remaining player dies.From time to time, power-ups are released from objects destroyed on screen. Some power-ups give special weapons such as an extremely fast-firing machine gun or an automatic shotgun with a lower firing rate and larger area of effect. Others grant extra grenades or additional points.</story>

Each maze must be completed within a tight time limit and a number of traps and obstacles litter the mazes to slow players down.[-LF-]There are, however, a number of postitive targets to be hit, and bonuses - such as additional time - can be found hidden away within the mazes. When the ball is stuck or the player would like to speed up, the JUMP button can be used. If the player runs out of time before reaching the goal, a random matching game is run to allow the player more time to complete the maze. This challenge, however is very difficult to win.</story>

The player does not control the flight of vehicles, but only presses a button to drop bombs which destroy rocks and give points. Each rock is labeled with the points given for destroying it. As the number of rocks is reduced, it becomes harder to hit them without missing. The third time a player drops a bomb without hitting a rock, the game is over.</story>

    <story>CarnEvil is set in the fictional town of Greely Valley, Iowa, wherein the protagonist (called Jacob in the manual) takes a tour through the town cemetery. According to the story&apos;s premise, if a golden token is inserted into the mouth of the jester&apos;s head on top of the tombstone of Professor Ludwig von Tökkentäkker, a haunted amusement park will appear after long absence.Jacob and his friend Lisa investigate this legend, and fulfill the conditions of the premise; whereupon the jester&apos;s head comes to life and raises the undead carnival from the ground, all trying to take their brains. During this process, Jacob obtains a shotgun from the shooting gallery at the entrance to fight through hordes of monsters, zombies, and insects.Jacob faces enemies in the three attractions - the Haunted House, Rickety Town, and Freak Show - and must defeat a strong &apos;boss character&apos; at the end of each, as well as periodic sub-bosses. After escaping all three areas, he enters the Big Top, and fights clowns and circus animals to reach the center ring, whence he is taken to Tökkentäkker&apos;s zeppelin to face Tökkentäkker and his jester Umlaut. Tökkentäkker is defeated when the player strikes him into the zeppelin&apos;s propellers, causing both to collapse. Thereafter Jacob wakes in the cemetery, which has returned to normal. Seeing the token emerge from Tökkentäkker&apos;s tombstone, he re-inserts it while Lisa orders him not to do so.</story>

    <story>The goal of the game is to shoot at targets, while carefully avoiding running out of bullets. Three rows of targets scroll across the screen in alternating directions; these include rabbits, ducks, owls, and bonus items. If a duck target crosses the bottom row without being shot, it will come to life and begin flying down toward the player. Any ducks that reach the bottom of the screen in this manner will eat some of the player&apos;s bullets. Objects also periodically appear among the targets that will give the player extra bullets or points when hit. A spinning wheel with eight pipes sits above the rows of moving targets; these pipes and all targets must be shot in order to complete the round.At the end of each round, the player receives bonus points for all bullets remaining in his supply. He then plays a bonus round, where a large white bear with a target walks across the screen. Each time the bear is shot, it rears up for a second, then begins walking more quickly in the other direction. The object is to shoot the bear as many times as possible until it escapes off the screen. Following the bonus round, the next wave begins. Later bonus rounds add more bears to the screen.In higher levels, there are more duck targets and fewer extra bullet targets, putting a premium on accurate shooting. The game ends when the player runs out of bullets.</story>

    <story>The 1990s was a decade of great change marked by growing friendships between old enemies and never before seen levels of co-operation between powerful nations of the world. However, in 1997, using new weapons designed in secrecy, the Middle Eastern country of Rabu threatened to destroy this fragile peace.Rabu&apos;s proported goal is to purge the world of sin and force a new morality, with her allies. Rabu quickly claimed the Middle East, then spread into both southern Asia and parts of Europe. Their weaponery is terrifyingly eeficient at manufacturing death. They seemed unstoppable. When they gassed Tokyo in 1999, U.S. intervention became unavoidable. If Rabu is allowed to use Japan&apos;s manufacturing facilities, there will be no end to the nightmare.Hoping to protect world peace, the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) heads out to the sea.</story>

The three-letter initials of the player with the highest score are used to form the first level&apos;s castle structure. When all gems in a castle have been collected, the player moves on to the next castle.

    <story>Strap on your vector spacesuit, and hop into your vector spaceship. It is a good old ship, and it has seen a lot of action. From navigating the asteroid belt and blasting aliens around the sun, to attacking evil space cannons, your little vector ship has done it all, and this time it has been upgraded with twin blasters. You see the ship in Cosmic Chasm seems to be the same spaceship that is in every vector game. You control it using rotation buttons and a thruster button, with a laser and a shield button thrown in for good measure, just like almost every other vector game around.[-LF-]Now here is what you have to do. You guide your ship through a space fortress room by room. Each room contains a center section that slowly grows and will eventually trap you if you are not fast enough. You can shoot the center section to slow its growth. Each room also contains several exits. One of the exits will always spew forth a bunch of bad guys, shoot them, then exit to go to a different room. Between rooms you get to see an excellent tunnel animation. The idea is to make your way to the center of the fortress, blast the power core, and then leave. There is a map at the top of the screen to keep you from getting lost. This is a pretty decent game. It has a lot more to offer than the one screen of bad guys that most vector games have.</story>

    <story>CHALLENGER is the newest video game to be introduced by Centuri. With its vivid colors and lively setting, it is sure to lure the most ardent player into game action.[-LF-]The game consists of 16 sectors (rounds) of play. Sector 1 begins with Large Energy Rings floating randomly across the screen. The Spaceship must avoid colliding with the Rings, or it will explode into a starburst of brilliant colors. The Spaceship dodges the Energy Rings by moving right or left across the playfield, while bursting them with the Spaceship&apos;s 3-directional guns. Bursting the Large Rings (100 points) breaks them into Medium Rings. Bursting the Medium Rings (200 points) breaks them into Small Rings. Bursting the Small Rings (400 points) causes them to disintegrate.[-LF-]The Spaceship is further protected by a feature called a &apos;Warp&apos; button. By depressing this button, the Spaceship will relocate from the top or bottom of the screen to the opposite side.[-LF-]If the Spaceship is in ultimate danger of being destroyed, releasing its Super Bomb will wipe out all the objects on the playfield, and add the point value of the objects to your score. Use of the Super Bomb is lost, if the ship is destroyed first. Only one Super Bomb is awarded per Spaceship.[-LF-]At any time, a colorful Space Bogey resembling a Worm may appear on screen and proceed to chase the Spaceship. If the Worm is destroyed by Spaceship fire, or dodged successfully for several seconds, a &apos;clang&apos; is heard and the Worm (500 points) wriggles off the screen in a bright red hue of embarrassment. If the Spaceship is caught by the Worm, a bell is sounded, and the astronaut is chased out of his ship in pursuit of safety.[-LF-]At random time intervals a Bonus Bug will walk across the playfield, stop, and count down a Bonus Number. This number is equal to 100 times its value. To receive this Bonus, the Spaceship must link with the nose of the Bonus Bug.[-LF-]When the Spaceship has survived 50 Seconds of playing time, it now enters the challenges of the next sector.[-LF-]The remaining 15 sectors are played in the same manner as Sector one. The differences include that each succeeding sector increases in difficulty. The Energy Rings increase in number and move faster across the screen making them harder to dodge. Also there are several Space Bogeys introduced in the first 8 sectors. They also increase in number with advancement through each sector. Some of the Space Bogeys resemble Comets whizzing through space. Others resemble Spaceships from other worlds. Each Space Bogey (500 points), is an assemblage of bright colors, and when destroyed, burst with a clang into a spray of bright light.[-LF-]Sectors 4, 8, 12, and 16, are alike as follows. A few seconds after the Energy Rings are broken into smaller pieces, they are pulled into a Black Hole in the center of the screen. While swirling across the game area, the condensed Rings expand and shatter into fragments which must be destroyed before they absorb the Spaceship.[-LF-]When Sector 16 has been accomplished, it will return to Sector 9.[-LF-]When Bonus levels are achieved, an additional Ship will be added to your game.[-LF-]CHALLENGER INSTRUCTIONS[-LF-]1. Burst energy rings to score and increase bonus levels.[-LF-]Large rings - 100 points[-LF-]Medium rings - 200 points[-LF-]Small rings - 400 points[-LF-]2. After all the small rings are hit, advance to the next sector.[-LF-]3. In each sector, space bogeys appear and score 500 points when hit.[-LF-]4. When the bonus bug walks across the playfield and stops, bonus points are counted down. To collect the bonus, link the ship with nose of the bug.[-LF-]5. Pressing the warp button immediately relocates the ship from the top or bottom of the playfield to the opposite side.[-LF-]6. The Super Bomb button destroys all objects on the playfield screen and awards total point value to your score.[-LF-]7. One Super Bomb is awarded per ship. Use of it will be lost if the ship is destroyed first.[-LF-]8. Game is over when all the ships have been destroyed.</story>

Each level also has a number of bombs placed at various points; the chameleon can hit these with its tongue to send them crashing towards nearby chickens.

Some tiles are taken up by skull and crossbones which kill the player if walked into. The skulls turn to time bombs one at a time and the player must walk over them to defuse them before they explode. They must avoid the skulls and make sure they do not block off a possible future route by circling it. Some tiles are also flags which can be collected for bonus points. When all skulls have turned to bombs and been defused, the level is complete and begins again at a harder level. As the game develops, stomping boots are introduced that move around the playing area.

    <story>Circus was one of the first games produced by Exidy that used a CPU (6502) to control the game logic instead of hand-crafted hard-coded logic circuits. It ran on a black &amp; white monitor with a color overlay that gave each row of balloons at the top of the screen a different color. It was designed and programmed by Edward Valeau and Howell Ivey of Exidy in 1977.Circus came in an upright dedicated cabinet, and may have also been available in a cocktail configuration as well. Circus machines had white sides with red painted sideart of several balloons in flight. The front of the machine was decorated with a large ornate monitor bezel that also doubled as a marquee (or nameplate). This bezel showed several clowns in a circus scene and had the game title spelled out with multicolored balloons. The control panel was unadorned, save for an analog spinner and a start button. The whole machine was finished off in black T-molding.At least 13,000 units, possibly as many as 20,000, were produced.</story>

    <story>In City Bomber, the player is in pursuit of a gang of criminals. In order to keep the criminals from escaping, the player must reach checkpoints within a specified amount of time. At the start of the game, the player&apos;s car can shoot missiles at enemy vehicles and is also able to jump over enemies or obstacles. When some enemy cars are destroyed, power-ups are released that augment the car&apos;s abilities. Missiles improve the destructive power of the car&apos;s weaponry, wings extend the car&apos;s jumping distance, rocket boosters speed up the car and buzzsaws allow the car to ram obstacles without damage for a short time.Collisions with other cars are not generally harmful to the player, although they may slow down the car. Oil slicks dropped by enemies will spin out the car and slow it down significantly. Collisions with obstacles or falling off the course will destroy the player&apos;s car. While the player has an unlimited supply of cars, crashes will cost the player time and the new car will lose all previously-collected power-ups. If the player does not reach the checkpoint (shown by a map on the left side of the screen) in time, the game is over.Points are scored by destroying enemy cars, with bonus points awarded at the end of each course for the amount of time remaining.</story>

    <story>Crazy Kong is an arcade game created by Falcon, released in 1981 and is similar to Nintendo&apos;s Donkey Kong. Although commonly mistaken as a bootleg version, the game is officially licensed for non-US markets[1] and is based on different hardware. The game retains all of the gameplay elements of Donkey Kong, but has all of the graphics redrawn and re-colorized. Crazy Kong is also known as Congorilla, Crazy Kong Part II, and Monkey Donkey.There are two versions of the original Crazy Kong and Crazy Kong Part II; the differences of which are in minor cinematic artifacts and bugs, color palette choices and minor gameplay differences. Crazy Kong Part I shows no copyright or company name on the title screen. Crazy Kong (parts I and II) runs on modified Crazy Climber hardware. In addition there are other versions of the game that run on Scramble, Jeutel, Orca, and Alca hardware. The official versions of game came in two different stand up cabinets that featured a large and angry, rather than comic, ape embedded in the artwork. The cabinets were created by Zaccaria.</story>

    <story>The object of Clay Pigeon was to shoot as many clay targets as you can, using an arcade light gun that was shaped like a shotgun. At the start of the game you are given the choice of selecting either Trap Shooting or Skeet Shooting. Trap shooting is where the clay target is thrown directly away from the shooter, while in skeet shooting the target is launched across the shooter&apos;s field of vision. The graphics are done in Exidy&apos;s realistic style, each round is played against a decent looking outdoor background, and an extremely repetitive announcer yells &apos;pull&apos; to warn you of each and every target being launched. After several rounds of targets, you finally get to go after some real live animals! The real live animals are of course, ducks! The ducks are small and fly onto the screen in small groups of up to around a half dozen or so, and unlike the earlier title Vs. Duck Hunt, you cannot miss any of these. Missing any ducks in this round ends the game instantly, and will more than likely have you fumbling for another quarter in an attempt to do it right this time.</story>

    <story>Agent X, complete with trenchcoat, Bogie hat, and briefcase, hurries through a series of adventures and misadventures to retrieve stolen plans and destroy dastardly Dr. Boom&apos;s subterranean bomb factory. Our masked hero descends to the depths of Dr. Boom&apos;s laboratory in a special elevator. On each floor he encounters a series of conveyor belts that are moving explosives. A giant bomb ticks down the game seconds while devices of Dr. Boom&apos;s plotting, such as bomb converters, forklifts deflecting shots back at Agent X, robot guards, acid pits, and crawling eyes shooting death rays, challenge the player(s).[-LF-]CLOAK &amp; DAGGER is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster video display. You control Agent X as he descends underground floor by floor in an elevator to Dr. Boom&apos;s lab, located on the 33rd floor. Your main goal is to retrieve Top Secret plans that are surrounded by an electrical arc. To stop the electrical current, Agent X must shoot all the fiery nodes as he fights off robot guards.[-LF-]As Agent X leaves the elevator on each floor, he must make his way carefully and quickly across the screen to another exit. Each floor displays a configuration of conveyor belts moving green unarmed and red armed explosives. Agent X can pick up the green explosives. The red explosives will explode on contact. Some floors have marauding robot guards, death-ray shooting crawling eyes, and acid pits.[-LF-]Once Agent X has the top secret plans in hand, he must make his way back to the surface. If he exits on a floor that was bombed on the way down, he will find a massive crater protected by node monsters and the previously mentioned attackers. If he exits on a floor that was not bombed, a superguard will join the other attackers to challenge Agent X. On the final level, rumors are that he will meet the notorious Dr. Boom himself.[-LF-]At the center of the display, a double-coiled fuse to a giant bomb is ticking down the game seconds for each level. Agent X can light the fuse in a rush for bonus points, but must be able to escape that level before the bomb explodes. If the fuse has shortened on its own to one coil, it lights automatically and prompts Agent X to make a mad dash to the waiting elevator. The doors close just as a burst of light from the explosion is seen. The game&apos;s perspective now changes to a full view inside the elevator. Messages flash across the elevator to give helpful hints on the next level.[-LF-]Dr. Boom has placed explosive mines on every 4th floor. On each of the preceding 3 floors Agent X can pick up a secret map box that will show him part of the safe path across the minefield on the next 4th floor.[-LF-]Agent X&apos;s first goal is to travel successfully from one elevator to the other; his second goal is to pick up a secret box to get a map of the minefield on levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32; the third goal is to light the bomb fuse and escape before the explosion.[-LF-]As game play progresses, Agent X may find an extra-life box and a mystery box that give bonus points, double speed, half speed, and occasionally, an extra life. Extra bonus points are earned for picking up green unarmed explosives or for skipping floors.[-LF-]If Agent X succeeds in capturing the top secret plans, he must fight his way back up to the top level. The appearance of box compressors, crawling eyes, and other enemies are more random on the way up than on the way down. If Agent X makes it back to the surface, a free game will be awarded (depending on the settings of the option switches).[-LF-]The game ends when you use up your last life or successfully make it to the surface.</story>

    <story>The game takes place in the underwater kingdom of Clu Clu Land. There&apos;s this mean Sea Urchin who steals all the gold bars (which looks remarkably like Rupees from Zelda) In each of the levels, you play this Lolo-type person, who just floats through each screen. The character&apos;s actual name is &apos;Bubbles&apos; (but he is known as &apos;Gloopy&apos; in the Japanese version, and he is actually a &apos;she&apos;). To change your direction, instead of pushing a direction on the controller, you need to grab poles and steer yourself to where you need to go. Anytime you run over a hidden gold bar, it appears. Run over enough of them, and a picture develops (this is predetermined in each level). The sea urchins will try to stop you, but you can stun them and run them into the wall. Just don&apos;t fall into the pits that spawns urchins. That&apos;s it. Just finds all of the invisible gold bars and you&apos;ve completed it all. Next level. The graphics are very plain. There&apos;s no scrolling, and the setting only changes slightly with each level. The sounds are alright. There&apos;s bouncy music throughout the game, and it&apos;s basically the only song you&apos;ll hear (other than the stage complete tune).</story>

    <story>Sega&apos;s answer to the legendary Tetris the rules of Columns are simple - a column of 3 square pieces - stacked one on top of the other - drops from the top of the screen into the play area. As with &apos;Tetris&apos;, the column puzzle pieces can be moved left and right as they fall, but unlike Tetris, they cannot be rotated. Instead, pressing a button will cause the order of the colored blocks in a column to shift by one position.[-LF-]The object of the game is to place columns at the bottom of the pit in such a way that lines of 3 or more like-colored blocks are created (either horizontally, vertically or diagonally). When this happens, these blocks disappear, and any blocks resting upon them immediately fall onto the recently vacated space. This will often cause additional lines to be arranged, producing a &apos;cascade&apos; effect. The key to a long game (and, ultimately, a high score) is to set up these cascades wherever possible.[-LF-]While not achieving the same legendary status as the mighty Tetris (something that no puzzle game can realistically hope to achieve), the &apos;Columns&apos; series has managed to garner a dedicated following of its own and is a respected example of the genre.,</story>

    <story>This game was for two or four players only you must have a live human opponent to play against, or else the other players character will go straight into a wall, making for a very quick and boring game. Each player moves their character around leaving a solid line behind them. All moves are made on an invisible grid, so you can only turn at 90 degree angles. To win you must last longer than your opponents before hitting something. Each player is eliminated when they crash, taking their lines with them. One good strategy is to turn around and head for the outer area of the screen (in four player mode), because everyone starts out headed for the center. Skirt around the edges until you only have one opponent left, then box them in. Pushing backwards on the stick will cause you to crash into your own line, so avoid that at all cost.,</story>

    <story>Congo Bongo (J- Tip Top (ティップタップ Tippu Tappu?)) is an isometric platform arcade game released by Sega in 1983. The game has come to be seen as Sega&apos;s answer to the highly successful Donkey Kong game that was released two years prior. The player takes the role of a red-nosed safari hunter who tries to catch an ape named Bongo. The hunter seeks Bongo to exact revenge for an apparent practical joke in which Bongo set fire to the hunter&apos;s tent, giving him a literal hotfoot. The game was named by Peter W. Gorrie who was the CFO of Sega at that time.</story>

    <story>Continental Circus, released as Continental Circuit in North America,[1] is a racing simulation arcade game,[9] created and manufactured by Taito in 1987. It was later ported to various home computers in 1989, including the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, MSX and ZX Spectrum. It was then released in 2005 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC as part of Taito Legends.The arcade version of this game comes in both upright and sit-down models, both of which feature shutter-type 3D glasses hanging above the player&apos;s head. According to Computer and Video Games in 1988, it was the world&apos;s first three dimensional racing simulation.[9] The home conversions of Continental Circus lack the full-on 3D and special glasses of the arcade version, or the detailed graphics, but retain the essential gameplay structure.</story>

And to top that, you have plenty of new moves, counterattacks, powerups, and key combinations to use.[-LF-]Whereas Cotton 2 was more of a tactical shooter (whenever that is applicable to the game) with its chain combo and life/experience system, Cotton Boomerang is an all-out shooter due to the added moves, different level layout, and generally faster and crazier gameplay.</story>

At the same time, one or more computer controlled cars run through the same maze in the opposite direction with the intention of ramming you. At each of four junctions in the maze, you have the option of changing lanes to avoid the oncoming cars. The objective is to pick up all the dots before the computer takes you out.</story>

    <story>The player controls a box tied to a floating balloon, which swings left and right continually, within a maze filled with spikes. Any contact with the spikes, either with the balloon or the box, destroys the balloon. Using a four-way joystick, the player moves the box through the maze and toward the goal, ensuring that the swinging balloon avoids the spikes.The player collects points as the box moves closer to the goal (backtracking earns no points). Certain areas of the maze are colored green and purple, and the player will earn more points if the balloon and box pass through the area safely. While there is no time limit, the player cannot wait for a long time; otherwise, a face will appear and blow the balloon into the spikes.As the player completes mazes, individual spikes, or even the entire maze, may begin moving or scrolling.</story>

    <story>A one or two player sideways scrolling platform shoot-em-up in which two cops, by the name of Tony Gibson and Raymond Brody, fight gangs of criminals over six platform-strewn stages. Each stage centres around a specific criminal activity, such as bank robbery or smuggling. The ultimate goal in Crime City is to find the King-pin &apos;boss&apos; characters that await the players at the end of each level, and arrest them.The game&apos;s heroes start each level armed with a pistol, and extra weapons become available as players progress through a level. Both the pistol and additional weapons have only a limited amount of ammunition, and if players runs out of ammo, they will only be able to punch or somersault attack into attacking enemies. Each stage features numerous background items that can be used to attack enemies, such as wooden barrels, boxes and hanging lights. When shot, some criminals drop packets of illegal drugs, which can be picked up for bonus points.Crime City&apos;s gameplay takes its inspiration from both Namco&apos;s Rolling Thunder and Sega&apos;s Shinobi.</story>

    <story>Crime Fighters is a beat-em up arcade game where your job is to rescue several women that have been kidnapped by a crime boss and clean up the streets by pummeling as many gang members as possible with your bare hands, as well as anything else you might possibly discover. You will travel through eight levels throughout the city, in locations that range from subways to the docks. At the end of every stage is a fight with a boss character, many of whom happen to be knockoffs of famous horror movie antagonists like Freddy Kruger and Jason Voorhees. Scoring is handled by a system wherein you simply get a point for every enemy you kill. Occasionally examples of cartoon physics pop up, such as when your character gets squashed flat by a moving steamroller or a falling billboard.</story>

    <story>Crossed Swords is a hack &amp; slash action RPG arcade game developed by Alpha Denshi and published by SNK for the Neo Geo arcade system in 1990 and Neo Geo console in 1991. Its gameplay was similar to SNK&apos;s earlier 1990 first-person shooter and beat &apos;em up game, The Super Spy, but with role-playing game elements and hack &amp; slash combat instead of shooting and fist-fighting.[1]The game allowed cooperative gameplay with up to two players on the same screen.[1] As only the player characters&apos; silhouettes are visible on screen as wire-frame models, much like Punch-Out!!,[2] the game&apos;s perspective may be considered either first-person[1] or third-person.[3] The game was later cited as an inspiration for the 2010 first-person fighting game Rage of the Gladiator.[4] A sequel of the game entitled Crossed Swords 2 was released in Japan on May 2, 1995 for the Neo-Geo CD, and was one of the few games designed specifically for the Neo-Geo CD, rather than being an arcade port.[5]</story>

The game also features more cars than Cruis&apos;n USA. This game introduced stunts to the Cruis&apos;n series. They served to dodge obstacles, take close curves and so. If the stunt makes the vehicle fly in the air, the game gives the player extra seconds of time. The game also uses small rocket boosts to speed up. The game was later released on the Nintendo 64 in 1998, being the best received of the Cruis&apos;n ports.</story>

The game was also released in Japan for the PC. The Saturn version made use of Sega&apos;s virtua gun which was developed for the Virtua Cop series of games. It was also compatible with the many lightguns produced for the PlayStation, namely the Konami Justifier. Scenery visuals and characters were all in 3D, while most of the enemies were in flat 2D sprites. Despite its horror theme the game doesn&apos;t take the theme seriously at all, relying on extensive gameplay instead due to its difficulty.</story>

    <story>Cyberball is an Atari Games arcade game of 7-man American football, using robotic avatars of different speeds, sizes, and skill sets. The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from cool to warm, hot, and critical status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to cool by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play.</story>

    <story>Darius is a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot &apos;em up set in a fictional future. Uniquely among shoot &apos;em ups, the game&apos;s screen is three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet uses an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game&apos;s stages (referred to as zones in the game.) The ship&apos;s arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game&apos;s zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path.</story>

Darius&apos; inhabitants have since situated themselves on the planet Olga while Darius&apos; societies, architecture and attacked areas were being repaired. The space flight Headquarters established on Olga picks up an SOS signal coming from Earth, where the first colonists originated before colonizing Darius. The signal included the description of alien ships similar to those of the Belser Army. Suspecting that these might be their remaining Earthling ancestors, the people of Darius sends both Proco Jr. and Tiat Young to help them.</story>

The Silver Hawk is also equipped with the &apos;Arm&apos; (armor); a green energy shield that can absorb enemy attacks without harm to the ship. Some enemies leave panels behind that can be collected to power-up your shots, missiles or shield.[-LF-]The graphics and sound are superior to those of the previous Darius games, and the game employs a lot of impressive visual effects; for example, the Silver Hawk warps into a stage dramatically in the fourth-tier stages, and begins to burn on re-entry at the start of the sixth-tier stages.[-LF-]The bosses are huge and far more complex than those of the previous games, each employing several attack patterns and explode with powerful warping and twisting effects upon their defeat.,</story>

    <story>Dark Edge is a 1992 fighting game by Sega for the Sega System 32. It uses sprite scaling to simulate a 3D playfield, meaning it predates Virtua Fighter as a 3D fighter by about a year (though the 3D in Virtua Fighter isn&apos;t simulated, but rather true rendered 3D graphics). You can play as either warriors or monsters, but otherwise this is a typical fighting game with a dedicated jump button (as Up moves back). Although the title screen reads 1992, the arcade game was first sold in early 1993.</story>

    <story>In addition to the original four heroes found in its predecessor, Dungeons &amp; Dragons- Tower of Doom (Cleric, Dwarf, Elf and Fighter), Shadow of Mystara adds a Thief and a Magic-User to the selection. Furthermore, with the inclusion of two separate versions of each character&apos;s sprite set, the game allows up to two players to select the same character (in Tower of Doom each of the characters could only be selected once), effectively giving the game 12 different characters to choose from. The two Clerics and two Magic Users also have subtle differences within their spell books.The controls are using four buttons- Attack, Jump, Select (brings up a small inventory ring around the character allowing the player to choose what item is set in the Use slot) and Use. The Cleric, Elf and Magic-User also have two extra rings for their spells, with the Jump button used to switch from ring to ring. While the game uses the same kick harness as the previous game, the Select and Use buttons are reversed.Shadow over Mystara also introduced a selection of special moves which are executed by moving the joystick and tapping the buttons in certain combinations, in a way similar to the Street Fighter series. The characters (except for the Magic-User) have a Dashing Attack as well as a Rising Attack which can be used to combo monsters or even juggle them in the air. Most characters (again, with the exception of the Magic-User and also Cleric) also have a Megacrush, a move common to nearly all of Capcom side-scrollers, which damages all enemies standing close enough to the character but in turn also damaging the player themselves.</story>

    <story>Tower of Doom is a side-scrolling arcade game featuring four different characters (cleric, dwarf, elf, fighter) fighting iconic Dungeons &amp; Dragons monsters. Bosses include a troll that regenerates unless burned, a large black dragon, the dreaded Shadow Elf (Mystara&apos;s equivalent of the drow), a beholder, the optional superboss Flamewing (a great wyrm red dragon) and the final boss Deimos (an archlich).At points in the game the players are presented with a choice of paths to take to continue progress. Each path goes to a different area, and it is impossible to visit every area in a single play.The gameplay is more technical than the average on beat&apos;em up games. In addition to the usual basic attacks and jumping it includes blocking, strong attacks, turning attacks, dashing attacks, crouching and evading. It also requires the use of careful tactics, as most enemies have the same abilities as the heroes and can out-range them, too.Daggers, hammers, arrows and burning oils can be used as throwing weapons, and many enemies have similar weapons. Spells can be used by means of magical rings or by the two playable spellcasters (a cleric and an elf).</story>

    <story>An interactive shooting game where players stalk deer in the wilderness during hunting season.[-LF-]You are able to select a wilderness where you want to go hunting. Then you will choose your hunting weapon- rifle, shotgun, power bow, or muzzleloader. Next, you will select one of four destinations within the wilderness you selected as your hunting ground. From here, your objective is to shoot and/or kill the male deer (bucks) while trying not to miss or shoot and/or kill female deer (does).[-LF-]Throughout the game, you will attempt to kill up to four male deer in four different areas within the selected wilderness for a total of up to 16 bucks. Each time you successfully kill a male deer, you are rated based on your scoring, timing and accuracy as well as the weight of the kill. You must try to shoot the bucks in the most vulnerable areas in order to wound and/or kill them instantly.[-LF-]After you have hunted through all four areas of the wilderness, the season is over and then you are rated on how well you did throughout the game based on scoring, the number of kills, the total weight and the timing and accuracy of your shooting. Afterwards, the game ends, regardless of the results.</story>

    <story>Defender is an arcade video game developed released by Williams Electronics in 1980. A shooting game featuring two-dimensional (2D) graphics, the game is set on a fictional planet where the player must defeat waves of invading aliens while protecting astronauts. Development was led by Eugene Jarvis, a pinball programmer at Williams; Defender was Jarvis&apos;s first video game project, and drew inspiration from Space Invaders and Asteroids. Williams planned to display the game at the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA) trade show, though development delays resulted in the team working on the game up until the show started.Defender was commercially successful, selling over 55,000 units to become the company&apos;s best selling arcade game. Praise among critics focused on the game&apos;s audio-visuals and gameplay. It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis&apos;s best contributions to the video game industry, as well as one of the most difficult video games. Defender was ported to numerous platforms, inspired the development of other games, and was followed by sequels and many imitations.</story>

    <story>Depthcharge is a 2-Dimensional shooter. You control your destroyer on the surface of the water while submarines patrol underneath. Your job is to drop depth charges to eliminate these submarines. The submarines aren&apos;t defenseless as they launch mines straight up toward your ship.[-LF-]Depthcharge was one of the early video games. Action was simple. This game also had the ability to retain the highest score (without the initials of course). Although the game is simple in concept, just trying to get enough points was enough to keep you working at it. Good luck on your submarine hunting mission.</story>

    <story>An arcade puzzle game in which a single player must tunnel their way through a number of underground caves, collecting the many gems spread throughout the levels. Each cave is litterered with rocks which, should they fall onto the player, will result in a loss of life. Carefully planned tunnels can be dug to manipulate the direction in which the rocks fall, however, which makes them an effective weapon against the many enemies that populate the levels. A number of red explosives can be found which can also be used to kill enemies and also to destroy any walls blocking the player&apos;s path. Again, like the rocks, these must be used carefully to prevent the explosion from killing the player.[-LF-]In order to complete a level, a specified number of gems must be collected. Once a sufficient amount of gems have been collected, an exit will open which the player must enter to proceed to the next cave.[-LF-]Diamond Run is heavily based on First Star&apos;s Commodore C64 classic, &apos;Boulder Dash&apos;.</story>

    <story>Die Hard Arcade is a beat &apos;em up for two players, who play as either John McClane or Chris Tompsen (Bruno Delinger and Cindy Holiday in the original Japanese version). Players fight their way through waves of enemies, using their fists, feet, and a variety of weapons that can be collected from enemies or the environment, from household items such as brooms and pepper shakers to high-damage missile launchers and anti-tank cannons. Most weapons are automatically lost at the end of each action scene, but hand guns can be retained so long as they have ammunition remaining. The typical level structure is a number of minions the player must defeat in many rooms, followed by a boss. Bosses can be anything from human minions of White Fang to spider robots. Quick Time Events are interspersed between many of the scenes. In these events, the player(s) may be running and turning a corner and they face an enemy, so they must perform a designated command to avoid being injured or to help defeat an enemy. In some cases failing a Quick Time Event will result in loss of health, as is usual for QTEs, but failing most will put the player characters into an additional action scene which they otherwise would not have to complete. Cut scenes are interspersed into the action.</story>

    <story>Donkey Kong is an arcade game released by Nintendo in 1981. It is an early example of the platform game genre, as the gameplay focuses on maneuvering the main character across a series of platforms while dodging and jumping over obstacles. In the game, Jumpman (since renamed Mario) must rescue a damsel in distress, Lady (now named Pauline) from a giant ape named Donkey Kong. The hero and ape later became two of Nintendo&apos;s most popular characters.The game was the latest in a series of efforts by Nintendo to break into the North American market. Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo&apos;s president at the time, assigned the project to a first-time game designer named Shigeru Miyamoto. Drawing from a wide range of inspirations, including Popeye, Beauty and the Beast and King Kong, Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game alongside Nintendo&apos;s chief engineer, Gunpei Yokoi. The two men broke new ground by using graphics as a means of characterization, including cut scenes to advance the game&apos;s plot, and integrating multiple stages into the gameplay.Despite initial misgivings on the part of Nintendo&apos;s American staff, Donkey Kong proved a success in North America and Japan. Nintendo licensed the game to Coleco, who developed home console versions for numerous platforms. Other companies cloned Nintendo&apos;s hit and avoided royalties altogether. Miyamoto&apos;s characters appeared on cereal boxes, television cartoons, and dozens of other places. A lawsuit brought on by Universal City Studios, alleging Donkey Kong violated their trademark of King Kong, ultimately failed. The success of Donkey Kong and Nintendo&apos;s win in the courtroom helped position the company to dominate the video game market from its release in 1981, until the mid 1990s.</story>

    <story>The gameplay is similar to Metal Slug and other run and gun games. It lacks the vehicles that were an element of Metal Slug.In addition, there are some unique features in the game. Each of the four characters brings along a pet, which can be sent to attack enemies or used as a shield. There are three buttons- Shoot, jump, and shield. Holding the shoot button charges your pet, and when released the pet launches a stationary devastating attack for a few seconds. The shield button converts the pet into a shield that is permanent - until you press the button again or it takes enough damage to disappear. Melee attacks and pet attacks release hearts which boost your shield power.Characters include Jake and Sara, two regular humans from Earth. Dr. J, a scientist, and Maya an ape. All characters largely play the same.</story>

    <story>For the second game in the Mr. Do. series the clown finds himself in a traditional platforms and ladders game. Each level is made up of six floors (seven including the castle&apos;s ramparts) and all are joined by a number of inter-connecting ladders. The ladders come in two different varieties- vertical ladders, which are fixed and cannot be moved; and diagonal ladders, which can be pushed left or right from the top of the ladder. This allows Mr. Do. to reach other areas of the level and is sometimes necessary to redirect the path of any pursuing enemies.[-LF-]The enemies in Mr Do&apos;s Castle come in the form of unicorns, and as with the enemies of the first game, they will hunt down and try to kill Mr. Do. Replacing the &apos;Powerball&apos; weapon of the original game, Mr Do is now armed with a mallet. This can be used to temporarily stun the game&apos;s unicorns and buy the player time to escape; but its primary function is to knock out the floor blocks that form each level&apos;s platforms.[-LF-]Most blocks are marked with a cherry and collecting all of these will complete the level. A level can also be completed by killing all of the unicorns. This is achieved by using the mallet to remove blocks and knock holes in the platforms. The unicorns will fall into any holes that the player has created; some simply fall through to the platform below, whereas others are trapped. Trapped unicorns can be hit with Mr. Do&apos;s mallet and knocked to a lower platform - useful for buying a few extra seconds for the player. If left alone, however, the unicorns will climb out, filling the hole in behind them, and transform into much nastier enemies. These new enemies cannot be stunned with the mallet and must be killed by dropping blocks onto them from the platform above.[-LF-]Some sections of a platform have two &apos;skull&apos; blocks at either end of them, with normal cherry blocks in-between. When both skull blocks are knocked out with the mallet, all the blocks in between will fall to reveal wooden floorboards. This is highly effective in killing several enemies at once.[-LF-]Each level also has three &apos;Key&apos; blocks. If Mr.Do. knocks out all of the key blocks, a large door opens at the top of the screen to reveal a shield which, when collected, turns the unicorns into &apos;Alphamonsters&apos;. The Alphamonsters flee from Mr. Do. and can be killed either with the mallet, or by dropping a floor block onto them from above. When Mr. Do. kills an Alphamonster, its letter appears on a flagpole at the top of the screen. If the players collects all five letters, an extra life is awarded.,</story>

Once all of the spots are covered with a domino, the chain is complete. The player will then have the choice of either knocking them all down to clear the level, or simply wait for a few seconds to continue to the next screen, in hope of completing the chain on THAT level, and so on. In this way, the player can set up several chains and knock them all down in one fell swoop, earning many bonus points in the process. Multiple chains are, of course, very difficult to achieve.[-LF-]Domino Man&apos;s progress is hampered by a neighborhood bully who walks onto the screen and tries to knock over the first dominoes he comes across. The player must either try to complete and topple the chain of dominoes before the bully knocks them over, or hit the bully with a domino; causing the bully&apos;s trousers to fall down and disabling him for a few seconds. A killer bee also appears, and if it manages to sting the player, a life is lost. A bag lady and a boy pushing a shopping cart wander blindly around the levels, occasioanlly knocking over some of the dominoes. Domio Man can hit them, however, causing them to change direction.[-LF-]Once a game is over, a poem is displayed on-screen to evaluate the player&apos;s performance on the game.

    <story>A superb final entry into the Mr Do! series (not counting the Neo Geo-based Neo Mr. Do which was merely a remake of the first game in the series), Do! Run Run takes its inspiration from Namco&apos;s Pac-Man.[-LF-]As in his previous games, Mr Do! must once again collect coloured dots and/or fruit while avoiding or killing a number of enemies. For the fourth Mr Do! outing, Universal ditched the sideays viewpoint of the series&apos; previous games and switched to an overhead perspective. This allowed the game to give an impression of &apos;depth&apos;, with slopes and steps affecting Mr Do!&apos;s mobility and speed.[-LF-]Mr. Do. has two items at his disposal with which he can kill the his enemies. The first is the &apos;Powerball&apos;, which featured in the original &apos;Mr. Do!&apos; but was dropped from the first two sequels. The Powerball can be shot directly at an enemy to kill it instantly.[-LF-]The second offensive option is provided in the form of the large wooden logs that litter the levels. These work in the same way as the apples did in the original game, and can be pushed free of their supporting struts, causing them to roll down the screen and kill everything in their path, including Mr. Do. himself if he strays too near.[-LF-]As Mr Do! moves around a screen, he trails a line behind him. Players can join the two ends of the line up to form a rectangle (in a similar fashion to Taito&apos;s 1981 classic, Qix) which will change any dots within the rectangle into cherries. A second rectangle can be drawn around the cherries which in turn will change them into apples. This can be repeated twice more, changing apples into lemons, and lemons into pineapples. The better the fruit, the more bonus points Mr Do! will earn when he collects them.,</story>

Two different types of background music (&apos;normal&apos; and &apos;hard&apos; beats) and three racing levels (easy, normal, and hard) are available. The top six times are tracked in each of the rally legs; including the super special stage.A North American release was planned by Accolade, though it was never released.

    <story>A fast moving platform game in which the player controls the Indiana Jones-esque and unfortunately named &apos;Edward Randy&apos;. The levels are an inventive mix of standard platform action and 3-D scrolling levels; the latter usually having the player driving a jeep and repelling the enemy attacks. The game is based on the archetypal Hollywood action blockbuster and features a filmic score to back up the on-screen action. The player&apos;s only weapon is a whip - another nod to the Indiana Jones character - which can be used to both attack enemies and as a &apos;rope&apos;, to enable the player to reach distant platforms.</story>

    <story>Eight Forces is a weird game. Everything about it, the visuals, the music, the theme, it’s all quite bizarre, but fascinating. Not many people know its actually related to the Star Force series, more so as a kind of ‘gaiden’ than a continuation of the story, though none of us will really know for sure considering the games story is incredibly mysterious and nothing is really known about it. Despite the English title displayed, the direct translation from the Japanese katakana of the game is ‘Eight Force’.</story>

Empire features four stages of play with the first two putting the player in control Luke Skywalker&apos;s SnowSpeeder, and the second two in control of Han Solo&apos;s Millenium Falcon.[-LF-] The first level, Probots, takes place on the ice planet of Hoth, with the player flying the Snowspeeder over the planet&apos;s surface to find and destroy the Empire&apos;s search droids that are sending signals to the Empire warning them of the rebels&apos; presence.[-LF-] The second Snowspeeder stage sees the player taking on the Empire&apos;s AT-AT Imperial walkers, as well as a number of smaller, bi-pedal AT-ST walkers. On this level, as well as the standard guns, the Snowspeeder is armed with a limited number of harpoons; these can be fired at the AT-AT&apos;s legs to send them crashing to the ground. AT-ATs can also be destroyed by shooting a small, highlighted area on the AT-ATs&apos; head.[-LF-] The third level has the player piloting the Millenium Falcon and is a repeat of the original game&apos;s in-space Tie Fighter battle.[-LF-] For the fourth and final level the player must pilot the Millenium Falcon safely through a densely packed and fast-moving asteroid field.[-LF-]Bonus points can be earned by destroying a certain number of targets. A JEDI letter will also be awarded in addition to the bonus points. Once all the letters that spell the word &apos;JEDI&apos; have been awarded, players will have attained true JEDI FORCE, making them invincible to the Empire&apos;s forces for a limited amount of time.[-LF-]In all levels of play, collisions with objects and enemy shots will cause damage to the player&apos;s deflector shields.,</story>

A powerful crime syndicate is creating chaos in the cop&apos;s home city and he must prove his ability as a police officer by capturing a number of crime bosses, killing as many of their henchmen as possible in the process. The policeman carries a standard issue pistol which only has a limited amount of ammunition. In the event of the ammunition running out, players will only be able to kick their enemies. Extra Ammo can be picked up at various points in the levels.[-LF-]As the player progresses through the game and makes more and more arrests, their on-screen character will be promoted through the ranks. First to Captain, then Assistant Chief, Chief and finally, once three crime bosses have been arrested, to a full E-SWAT agent. Adorning full, robot-style body armour that bears more than a passing resemblance to the Robocop character from the games and movies of the same name. In armoured mode, the cop has vastly increased firepower, including a limited number of bombs that are ejected by a mechanical device on the policeman&apos;s back.[-LF-]As the armoured cop is shot, his armour will gradually disappear until he is finally killed.[-LF-]E-Swat plays very much like a cross between Sega&apos;s own 1987 classic Shinobi, as well as Namco&apos;s superb Rolling Thunder.</story>

    <story>The player controls a hat-wearing eyeball in a maze. As in Pac-Man the goal is to collect all of the dots to advance to next level, but in Eyes you shoot the dots rather than eat them. Computer-controlled eyes chase and shoot at the player. Shooting a computer eye gives points and removes it from the level, but it will reappear a short time later. Being shot by a computer eye is fatal.As the game progresses, more computer eyes are added to levels and they take less time to shoot at the player. They also move faster.</story>

This was released by Exidy in 1983 and written by Vic Tolomei and Larry Hutcherson hopeful to play on the Trivial Pursuit craze as it was released over a year earlier than the registered Trivial Pursuit versions (produced by Bally/Sente).The game came in what was essentially a jukebox cabinet (complete with a woodgrain finish), which lent itself to possible markets outside of the typical arcade setting. It had a 9-inch monitor mounted in the center, logo on the bezel itself and a row of buttons on each side of the screen to accommodate two player simultaneous play. Fax used unique compression to hold nearly 3700 questions in as small of storage as possible. Exidy also sold several EPROM replacement kits that provided new questions but they are nearly impossible to find today.</story>

The game runs on Namco NA-1 hardware, was the first game on this hardware to be released outside Japan (Bakuretsu Quiz Ma-Q Dai Bōken was the first overall) and is the only game from the company that showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation&apos;s Winners Don&apos;t Use Drugs screen in its attract sequence with vertical orientation (the two titles that displayed it previously, Tank Force and Steel Gunner 2, both displayed it with horizontal orientation).</story>

    <story>The Great Grapple is an international cross martial arts tournament that is held only once a year. It is an event organized by an individual known only as K, the invincible undefeated emperor. In the previous years it was held, it used to be a suitable gathering event for martial artists who pride themselves as the world&apos;s strongest. However, K was always the champion. As a man who never appeared to the public, K was feared by many as a servant of God. However, the Great Grapple continues to be held each year without fail. This year, only nine fearless martial artists applied for the tournament. There are those that had been lured in by the prize money. And then there are those who fight for their pride as martial artists.</story>

    <story>The game plays similarly to other 2D versus fighting games, especially both SNK&apos;s Fatal Fury 2 and Art of Fighting. In fact, it shapes itself after Fatal Fury 2 while it uses Art of Fighting&apos;s game engine. There are 8 characters to select from and two boss characters (the first boss character is only playable in two player mode). The object of the game is to win two matches out of three. Each character has a set of moves in addition to two basic punches and kicks. Each character also has a super move called a Danger Move, which are similar to the Desperation Moves from Fatal Fury 2. Players also have the ability to taunt others, but unlike games such as Art of Fighting, this has no effect and would actually leave the player open to attacks.There are two bonus games that reward the player with points dependent on how successful the player is. The first game is a brick-breaking game that requires rapid pressing of the A button. The second bonus game requires the player to break boards held up by trainers popping out of the left and right sides. Both bonus games were also in Capcom&apos;s 1987 arcade game, Street Fighter, as well as one of them also in Midway&apos;s 1992 arcade game, Mortal Kombat and the ones in Art of Fighting.</story>

The name would remain the same for all ported platforms, except for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis versions, which Sega released outside of Japan as James &apos;Buster&apos; Douglas Knockout Boxing featuring Buster Douglas himself in 1990 immediately after his victory over Mike Tyson.The game is essentially a side scrolling boxing game where the player moves left and right to control a screen sized boxer. When the timing is right, the player can unleash a final blow punch which can sometimes KO the opponent in a single strike. The home versions contained a spectator mode where the player can watch their favorite boxers compete.</story>

    <story>Final Lap is a racing video game produced by Namco,[2] and released by Atari Games for the United States in 1987. It was the first game to run on Namco&apos;s then new System 2 hardware, and is a direct successor to Namco&apos;s two earlier Pole Position games (1982-1983).Final Lap was the first racing game to allow up to eight players to simultaneously race on the Suzuka Circuit, in a Formula One race. This was, at the time, considered a revolutionary feature and was implemented by linking together up to four two-player sitdown-style arcade cabinets.[2][3] It was also arguably the first racing game to implement rubber banding to ensure that less talented players were never too far behind the leader, a concept that would be taken much further by the Mario Kart series.[3] There was also a single player mode, in which the player&apos;s score was based on how far the car travelled until time ran out or if the player completed four laps (on default settings; the arcade operator can set the lap number to be as low as three or as high as six).</story>

    <story>Fire One! was a player-versus-player or player-versus-computer submarine showdown, designed and programmed by David Rolfe, Ted Michon, and Susan Ogg for Exidy in 1979. The cabinet was split into two halves, with each player controlling their first-person submarine perspective on their half of the screen.The primary objective of the game is to find and destroy the enemy&apos;s submarine, while avoiding the enemy&apos;s torpedoes. Through your virtual periscope you are free to launch one of your 8 torpedoes to take out any of the enemy&apos;s various ships for extra points. It takes some time to reload each torpedo tube, so you must be judicious in how you plan your attacks.In addition to being able to control the left/right rotation of your periscope, the game also features a submerge button which you can use to temporarily hide from the enemy. Holding this button down keeps you hidden but also keeps you out of the action, allowing the enemy free reign over the seas.</story>

    <story>Frenzy followed the basic paradigm set by Berzerk- the player must navigate a maze full of hostile robots. The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible and score points by killing robots and travelling from room to room. The game has no end other than the player losing all of his or her lives.The player has a gun with which to shoot the robots, and simple intelligence of the robots means that they can often be tricked into shooting one another. If the player lingers too long in a room, a bouncing smiley face (known as Evil Otto) appears, and relentlessly chases the player. Evil Otto will destroy any robots in his way, and can move through walls.</story>

    <story>Frogger is an arcade game introduced in 1981. It was developed by Konami, and licensed for worldwide distribution by Sega/Gremlin. The object of the game is to direct frogs to their homes one by one. To do this, each frog must avoid cars while crossing a busy road and navigate a river full of hazards. Skillful players may obtain some bonuses along the way. The game is regarded as a classic from the golden age of video arcade games and was noted for its novel gameplay and theme. It was also an early example of a game using more than one CPU, as it used two Z80 processors.</story>

    <story>Front Line is Taito America Corporation&apos;s action war game. Traveling through enemy territory the player must accomplish the ultimate mission or meet a violent end - capture the enemy fort and win total victory.[-LF-]The journey begins slowly with the player armed with a gun (special Gun Control) and hand grenades. Quickly he becomes a target for enemy soldiers who also have guns and grenades. Moving faster, he races past trees that hide the enemy who now unleash an ambush barrage of bullets and bombs. Even the ground he races over has been booby-trapped with land mines.[-LF-]If the player successfully makes it through this deadly obstacle course, he meets an even greater challenge... the enemy is attacking with tanks! His gun now useless, the player can stand and fight with grenades or leap into his own tank (special Tank button) and counter attack.[-LF-]The battle rages on all fronts as the player fights for his life, racing for cover behind brick walls while outrunning grenades thrown by soldiers in fox holes. It&apos;s all-out war when the player jumps from his tank into a larger one with greater firepower.[-LF-]Now comes the final test of victory as the enemy&apos;s fort looms in sight. The player must leap from the tank and run through a hail of bullets to throw one final grenade. The white flag heralds total victory!</story>

    <story>The gameplay of Final Star Force goes back to the formula of the original Star Force, but with updated graphics and some extra power-ups. Other things that have been changed from the original are the style of the title screen&apos;s logo, the background, and some enemies. Players control the two space fighter ships Blue Nova and Red Nova. There are three different power-ups to choose from called Pulsators. Each name of a Pulsator has a letter at the beginning of it (e.g. A-Pulsator, B-Pulsator, C-Pulsator). The power-up system is similar to the one seen in the 1990 Raiden arcade game. Unlike other games that requires players to obtain powerups to enhance their ships, the power meter itself charges up automatically to increase their fighters&apos; power.</story>

    <story>Galaga (ギャラガ Gyaraga?) is a fixed shooter arcade game developed and published by Namco in Japan and published by Midway in North America in 1981. It is the sequel to Galaxian, released in 1979. The gameplay of Galaga puts the player in control of a space ship which is situated on the bottom of the screen. At the beginning of each stage, the area is empty, but over time, enemy aliens fly in formation, and once all of the enemies arrive on screen, they will come down at the player&apos;s ship in formations of one or more and may either shoot it or collide with it. During the entire stage, the player may fire upon the enemies, and once all enemies are vanquished, the player moves onto the next stage.Galaga has proven very successful. The arcade version of it has been ported to many consoles, and it has had several sequels, most recently Galaga Legions for the Xbox Live Arcade service.The objective of Galaga is to score as many points as possible by destroying insect-like enemies. The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player&apos;s last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured.Galaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player&apos;s hit/miss ratio at the end of the game, and a bonus Challenging Stage that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player&apos;s ship or trying to crash into it.</story>

    <story>The gameplay in Galaga &apos;88 is built on the same premise as that of the original Galaga game, but is in many ways more complex and more difficult. The game is divided into a series of 29 Stages distributed through eight Worlds. The starship Galaga accelerates between Stages and Worlds and even to higher dimensions (go to the section on Dimensional Travel below to find out more).With the exception of the third and eighth, each World culminates in a Challenging Stage. There are six such stages to engage in any full game, and each begins with the on-screen announcement That&apos;s Galactic Dancin&apos;! and has its own YM2151-generated song to which the enemy formations dance. In any given Challenging Stage, both the design of the enemies and their dancing formations shall vary according to the player&apos;s current Dimension. As in Galaga, the objective is to destroy all forty enemies before they fly away off the screen. However, refraining completely from touching any controls for the duration of a Challenging Stage awards a secret bonus ranging in value from 10000 to 25000 points, and equal to the special bonus which would have been awarded for destroying all forty enemy aliens instead.Galaga &apos;88 introduces a variety of new enemies and behaviors. Most of these special enemies are worth varying amounts of bonus points when destroyed. Some enemies can combine into larger enemies which take multiple hits to destroy, while others arrive in eggs, explode in a shower of fireworks, grow with multiple hits, or sport armor which makes them invincible while in formation. Certain enemies drop small formations of tiny creatures that wiggle their way down the screen, and still others can act as escorts to incoming groups of enemies and then quickly dive at the player before leaving the game. Most stages also include various obstacles which appear once the enemy formation has been assembled. These can be destroyed with either one or several shots, and the first one on each stage will leave a Warp Capsule.At the start of the game, the player can select how many Galaga starships to start with (one or two), affecting their number of remaining lives. The game ends after the final boss is defeated (or when the player&apos;s last ship is destroyed or captured) - in the latter case, the player can continue the game for an additional credit. The Game Over screen shows the player&apos;s hit-miss ratio and a visual representation of their progress. If the player reaches Stage 27, the game also shows a picture of the final boss (damaged if defeated, but silhouetted if not). If the arcade operator has set the continue option to on, the player also cannot continue if he is defeated on Stages 27-29.</story>

    <story>Musashi Ganryuki, (武蔵厳流記), known outside Japan as Ganryu, is a platformer and hack and slash video game developed by Visco Corporation and published by SNK in 1999 on Neo Geo MVS. It is loosely based on Miyamoto Musashi&apos;s fight with Sasaki Kojirō. Sasaki went by the fighting name of Ganryū, hence the game&apos;s name Ganryu Musashi.The game&apos;s selectable characters are the samurai swordsman Miyamoto Musashi and his female kunoichi counterpart Suzume. The mission of the game is to rescue Musashi&apos;s love Otsu from a clan of evil ninja led by Kojiro Sasaki. Players are armed with a sword (katana for Musashi/kaiken for Suzume) and a grappling claw. The claw serves as a long-range weapon, and can act as a grapnel in certain settings to reach higher ground or ascend over chasms. A powerful projectile attack can also be achieved by holding down the attack button, although this takes time to charge. Additional temporary weapons can be found throughout the game, such as shuriken for Musashi, kunai for Suzume, and an energy ball weapon. Upon rescuing hostages, rewards are given to the player in form of food (onigiri, takoyaki), which can restore health, or ryo coins for extra points.</story>

    <story>The 3rd game in Namco&apos;s classic Galaxian series Gaplus picks up where 1981&apos;s Galaga left off. While maintaining the same classic &apos;look&apos; of its predecessor, Gaplus&apos;s graphics a definite improvement over those of Galaga; the game&apos;s increased colour palette and subtle use of shading making the attacking aliens look rather more solid.[-LF-]Another enhancement over its prequel is in the addition of a player-acquired &apos;Tractor Beam&apos;. In Galaga, only the enemies had access to the beam; enabling them to capture one of the player&apos;s ships (the player then had to shoot the captor to release the ship). For the sequel, however, the player can now acquire the Tractor Beam. This is achieved by shooting one of the alien formation&apos;s &apos;generals&apos; - a visibly more colourful alien than its comrades. The Tractor Beam will then activate for a limited time and any aliens the players captures (up to a maximum of six) will dock alongside the player&apos;s ship for enhanced firepower.[-LF-]One final yet important addition is in the movement of the player&apos;s ship. In previous installments, the ship could only move left and right along the bottom of the screen; in Gaplus, however, the ship can now move UP the screen - although only to the halfway point. This is important as the alien&apos;s aggressive attack patterns will often see enemy craft swirling around the bottom of the play area.[-LF-]As with Galaga, Gaplus features regular &apos;challenge&apos; stages, with benign aliens swooping across the screen for the player to shoot, in order to earn extra bonus points.,</story>

The biggest difference from the original game is that players can choose identical classes, instead of being limited to a particular one for each joystick; the players being differentiated by colors. Thus, instead of having a warrior, wizard, and valkyrie (for instance), in Gauntlet II there could be a red wizard, a blue elf and a green warrior.In addition to the new class system, new level designs were added, including the possibility of encountering them in altered ways by having the playfield turned in steps of 90°.</story>

    <story>Gauntlet- Dark Legacy is the follow-up to Gauntlet- Legends and another installment in the long-running Gauntlet series of hack-and-slash action games. As with all the Gauntlet games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal. This version contains the characters and levels from Gauntlet- Legends, plus the new characters and levels from the Dark Legacy arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in.There are eight characters to initially choose from- the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you&apos;ll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there are some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes.</story>

    <story>A superb sprite-scaling shoot-em-up from Sega, in which a single player must battle their way through a number of superbly rendered, space-themed levels. Action switches between open space battles and planet-based levels; with tight, enemy packed tunnel sections (enemy bases) seperating each level.[-LF-]Galaxy Force II took the space-based shooting action of 1985&apos;s Space Harrier and, to a lesser degree, After Burner and improved upon both in every conceivable way. The game&apos;s pace is much slower paced than either Space Harrier or After Burner, making game progression more a result of actual skill than the blind luck often associated with those earlier titles.[-LF-]Elements of Galaxy Force II were also influenced by several NON-shooting Sega games; in particular the branching roads of 1986&apos;s Out Run. At the end of each of Galaxy Force II&apos;s stages, after the player has fought through the end-of-level &apos;enemy fortress&apos;; are tunnel sections offering a choice of left or right. Again, the choice made dictates which level the player tackles next.[-LF-]Galaxy Force II also demonstrated just how far Sega could push its then legendary sprite scaling technonolgy, with the visual rendition of some levels - such as when the player is flying above the surface of a volcanic planet, complete with solar flares and volcanic eruptions - being nothing short of spectacular.</story>

    <story>3 years have passed since the events of Ghosts&apos;n Goblins and Arthur the knight once again finds himself battling against the hideous creatures of Demon World. The demons have now seized the kingdom and Arthur returns home to witness the castle&apos;s lone survivor his beloved Gunievere, murdered by the king of the demons, Lucifer. Arthur once again embarks on a one-man quest to destroy the demonic invaders and save Gunievere&apos;s mortal soul.[-LF-]Game-play is of a very similar vein to that of Ghosts&apos;n Goblins - the classic run, jump and shoot action remains intact. Ghouls&apos;n Ghosts is, however, even more difficult than its already demanding predecessor. Arthur now has access to several new power-ups to aid him on his daunting quest, such as &apos;Golden Armour&apos; which gives Arthur greater protection from the demons. Additionally, unlike Ghosts&apos;n Goblins, Arthur can now fire his weapons upwards instead of just left or right and, while jumping, can fire beneath him as well.[-LF-]The graphics in Ghouls&apos;n Ghosts are predictably far superior to those of its 1985 prequel, with highly imaginative level design and superbly-drawn, smoothly animated enemies all adding to the game&apos;s superb Gothic feel.,</story>

The player controls one of four different futuristic aircraft and must destroy enemy aircraft, tanks, ships, and buildings using both guns and missiles mounted on the aircraft and a limited supply of bombs which damage or destroy all enemies on-screen when used. The game is based on the player(s) trying to destroy a medallion which possesses great power. Many of the bosses use the medallion as a weapon. At the end, it shows that an evil man who pilots a ship called the Stranger is the real person who is in control of the Medallion, and was responsible for the war, as well as other conflicts in the past including World War II, and you fight him three times as a mini-boss and as the last boss. He appears to be a friend of Stuck 30 years ago when you fight him with Stuck.</story>

    <story>Gimme a Break is a cue sports arcade game which was released by Bally and Sente in 1985; it was the first of the second batch of games to run on that company&apos;s SAC-I hardware, and the player must use a singular button to position the cue ball, with a trackball to control it during each shot. In a two-player game, one player must aim for the solid-coloured balls (1 to 7), while the other must aim for the white ones with a coloured stripe across them (9 to 15) - and in a one-player game there will also be bonus rounds where the player must pot bonus balls to earn extra shots. If players should pot three or more balls, with a single shot, they&apos;ll get treated to a slow-motion action replay of it; it is also worth noting that if a certain dip switch is set to on, this game will show pictures of children who were missing at the time in its attract mode (and this also applies to that other Bally/Sente game for 1985, Mini Golf).</story>

    <story>A direct sequel to 1987&apos;s After Burner G-loc adopts its predecessor&apos;s action-packed, if somewhat limited, gameplay, although the game&apos;s pace has been noticably reduced, making survival more a matter of skill than theshoot-and-hope gameplay of After Burner.[-LF-]The bulk of G-Loc&apos;s action is viewed from a first-person, in-cockpit view, but, at certain points of the game, the viewpoint switches to the familiar third-person perspective of After Burner, as the player&apos;s jet fighter is tailed by an enemy fighter. The player must roll and turn to shake off the pursuer, once this is achieved the game switches back to first-person perspective.[-LF-]The object of the game is to shoot a set number of enemy planes as they approach from front and behind; rolling and swerving to avoid incoming enemy fire. Certain stages feature ground-based enemy installations which must also be destroyed. The player&apos;s jet fighter is armed with both a machine gun, and a limited supply of missiles which can be &apos;locked-on&apos; to enemy targets. G-Loc&apos;s levels take the player through a variety of different landscapes, including wide, rolling plains and rock-strewn canyons. Later in the game, the player must attempt to land their fighter onto an aircraft carrier. Failure to do so results in the game ending.,</story>

He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. Three Warriors set out on a quest to rescue Yuria and avenge their losses at the hands of Death Adder. The first is a battle axe-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two handed broadsword looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a long-sword-wielding Tyris Flare, an amazon, whose parents were both killed by Death Adder.</story>

The bombs needed to blow the doors appear when certain enemies are killed.[-LF-]A fellow &apos;Goonie&apos; is trapped behind one of the doors on each level, and can be rescued, although this isn&apos;t necessary to progress to the next level.

    <story>With its title doubling as an acronym for Galactic Orbiting Robot Force, Midway&apos;s top-down space shooter undoubtedly has one of the silliest names in arcade history. Released in 1981, Gorf immediately grabbed players by talking to them in a terrifyingly eerie robotic voice, via the cutting-edge Votrax speech chip -- one of the first uses of synthesized speech in a game. Once they were in, players found themselves shooting up alien hordes across five distinctly different stages, several of which were well-made clones of popular arcade titles like Galaxian and Space Invaders. It may not have been entirely original (fun licensing fact- It was initially developed to be a Star Trek game), but that didn&apos;t make Gorf any less fun.</story>

    <story>The player controls a small blue spacecraft. The game starts in a fictional solar system with several planets to explore. If the player moves his ship into a planet, he will be taken to a side-view landscape. Unlike many other shooting games, gravity plays a fair part in Gravitar- the ship will be pulled slowly to the deadly star in the overworld, and downward in the side-view levels.The player has five buttons- two to rotate the ship left or right, one to shoot, one to activate the thruster, and one for both a tractor beam and force field. Gravitar, Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe and Space Duel all used similar 5-button controlling system.In the side-view levels, the player has to destroy red bunkers that shoot constantly, and can also use the tractor beam to pick up blue fuel tanks. Once all of the bunkers are destroyed, the planet will blow up, and the player will earn a bonus. Once all planets are destroyed, the player will move onto another solar system.The player will lose a life if he crashes into the terrain or gets hit by an enemy&apos;s shot, and the game will end immediately if fuel runs out.Gravitar has 12 different planets. Red Planet is available in all 3 phases in the universe; it contains a reactor. Shooting the reactor core activates a link. Escaping the reactor successfully moves the player to the next phase of planets, awards bonus points and 7500 units of fuel. Reactor escape time reduces after each phase and eventually becomes virtually impossible to complete.After completing all 11 planets (or alternatively completing the reactor three times) the player enters the second universe and the gravity will reverse. Instead of dragging the ship towards the planet surface, the gravity pushes it away. In the third universe the landscape becomes invisible and the gravity is positive again. The final, fourth universe, has invisible landscape and reverse gravity. After completing the fourth universe the game starts over. However, the reactor escape time will never reset back to high levels again.The programmers thought that even the best players could never complete the most difficult planets on the invisible levels.</story>

A single push-button labeled Kick causes the virtual player in possession to release the ball with the same force and direction in which he is currently running. (This button is duplicated on either side of the trackball for left or right-handed players.) The Player 1 (red trackball) side contained two additional push-buttons for choosing between Single or Two-Player games. Before each play, players are invited to select from a variety of formations, e.g. Sweep or Draw. The formation selected is displayed on a seven-segment LED on the player&apos;s control panel.</story>

    <story>GuitarFreaks (ギターフリークス?) is a music video game series produced by Konami. It is a rhythm game where the player uses a controller to simulate the playing of an electric guitar. The game consists of music predominantly from the rock music, rock and roll and J-pop genres. It is considered one of the most influential video games of all time, for having laid the foundations for popular guitar-based rhythm games, such as the Guitar Hero series.[2] Working Designs attempted to bring Guitar Freaks PlayStation 2 games in the U.S., but patent problems with the guitar controller prevented the project from moving forward.[3]The game is now in its nineteenth version, GuitarFreaks V8, which was released in March 28, 2011. It was speculated to be the final release of GuitarFreaks V. A spin-off series, GuitarFreaks XG was released in Japanese arcades on March 10, 2010,[4] which added two more buttons to the fret bar. A sequel, GuitarFreaks XG2, was released on March 9, 2011. Another sequel, GuitarFreaks XG3, was released on Feb. 23, 2012.</story>

    <story>Each player (2 people play at a time--there is no computer opponent) controls a gunfighter. Your left hand has a 4-way joystick which moves your gunfighter anywhere on your side of the screen. Your right hand has a gun grip which tilts up and down to aim your gunfighter&apos;s pistol and which has a trigger to fire. Your only goal is to shoot the other player who is right across the screen from you; he will then fall down and say &apos;Got Me&apos;. It isn&apos;t usually a straight shot, as there will always be cactuses, a moving stagecoach, or trees somewhere between the 2 players. (Another obstacle will be added for each hit scored.) Just shoot the other player for points. The game is time based, and not life based. The factory setting is for a 90-second game, but this is operator-adjustable down to as low as 60 seconds.,</story>

    <story>Gun.Smoke is very similar to Commando, another Capcom game, but with several differences. Whereas Commando is a run and gun game, this game is a scrolling shooter in which the screen scrolls upward automatically and players only have three ways to shoot, using three buttons for left, right, and center shooting. However, a player can also change the way the gunman shoots through button combinations. A player can still die by getting shot or struck by enemies like in Commando but improve protection by getting special items, including a horse, for protection up to three hits; boots, for speed of movement; bullets, for faster shots; and rifles, for shot length. These items are found by shooting barrels and rifles, boots, and bullets can stock up to five.</story>

    <story>The story of Guwange is set during the Muromachi period of Japan. During this time, increasing numbers of people suffer possession by shikigami. Although the shikigami grant great spiritual powers, the strain inflicted on the host causes them to die exactly one year after possession. However, a legend has sprung up regarding Guwange, the malevolent god trapped in Mt. Gokumon (i.e. Hell Gate). If one possessed by a shikigami can gather talismans of the five Chinese elements—wood, fire, earth, metal, water—from five demons serving Guwange, then infiltrate Gokumon and slay Guwange, the shikigami will be destroyed and the one possessed will not suffer a premature death.</story>

    <story>Gyruss (ジャイラス Jairasu?) is a shoot &apos;em up video arcade game developed by Konami, and released in 1983. It was designed by Yoshiki Okamoto, who had earlier created Time Pilot for Konami. Gyruss was licensed to Centuri in the United States, and was ported to numerous games consoles and home computers. It follows in the tradition of space war games such as Space Invaders and Galaga.Gyruss was the second and last game Yoshiki Okamoto designed for Konami, after Time Pilot. Due to pay disputes, he was fired after the release of this game, and soon joined Capcom, where he would write 1942 and the first Street Fighter game.The game&apos;s background music is an electronic, fast-paced arrangement of J. S. Bach&apos;s Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565; this particular arrangement is similar in sound to Toccata, a rock arrangement by the UK-based instrumentalist group Sky. Gyruss is notable for using stereo sound, which according to the bonus material for Konami Arcade Classics, was achieved by utilizing discrete audio circuits. The game used three microprocessors- two Z80 microprocessors and one 6809, as well as an 8039 microcontroller. For the sound, five AY-3-8910 PSG sound chips and a DAC.Gyruss was released in both upright and cocktail cabinets.R.Hirst KOO, M.Jones, BOX and the Elliott Brother&apos;s are arguably considered some of the best Gyruss players of the 1990&apos;s.</story>

    <story>Slide into the contoured seat and adjust it to fit the length of your arms and legs. Put your feet on gas and clutch pedals and try the stick shift. Select manual or automatic transmission, turn the ignition key and you&apos;re off![-LF-]It?s the ride of your life. You feel the tires grip the road when you take a wide turn at high speed. You&apos;re alerted to the smallest change in the road by the feedback steering. You catch air as you fly the draw bridge and land on the down ramp. You control the car as it holds the road on the dizzying vertical loop.[-LF-]Hard Drivin&apos; might look like an arcade game but it drives like a real car. For the best lap times, drive Hard Drivin&apos; as if it were a real car. The main difference between Hard Drivin&apos; and a real car is that Hard Drivin&apos; is much safer to drive. A player can test the limits of our car and his skill with no risk of personal injury, and follow a course that does not exist anywhere m the real world.[-LF-]After inserting the proper number of coins to start the simulator, the player can select either an automatic or manual transmission. Turning the ignition key starts the simulator.[-LF-]Drivers can choose between the stunt track or the speed track by following the posted signs on the road. Each player has a certain (operator-selectable) amount of time to reach a checkpoint or the finish line. Crossing checkpoints and the finish line rewards the player with (operator-selectable) bonus driving time.[-LF-]With Hard Drivin&apos; a player can test drive a high-powered sports car on a real stunt course. He can jump a draw bridge, negotiate a high-speed banked turn and drive a 360-degree vertical loop. These thrilling stunts, among others, provide the ultimate realistic driving experience.[-LF-]Or maybe high-speed driving is a particular player&apos;s type of excitement. He can &apos;put the pedal to the metal&apos; and try to keep control around the corners, weaving in and out of traffic while avoiding oncoming cars. All this, and more, await the player behind the wheel of Hard Drivin&apos;.[-LF-]Players especially enjoy the unique instant replay feature on Hard Drivin&apos;. Every time a player crashes, the simulator records and replays the crash sequence. Not only will the player find this entertaining, but it is also informative. The instant replay shows the player exactly what he did wrong and why he crashed (If a player wants to skip the instant replay, he can press the abort switch or turn the key when the replay starts).[-LF-]A skilled player finds the ultimate competition in the &apos;challenge&apos; lap (or &apos;grudge match&apos; as Atari Games likes to call it). The simulator remembers the path of the car driven by the best driver on record. When a player beats the qualifying lap time, he challenges the car of the past winner in a head-to-head race.</story>

    <story>Heavy Barrel is a 1987 overhead run and gun arcade game by Data East.Terrorists have seized the underground control complex of a nuclear missile site, and it is up to the player to infiltrate the base and kill the enemy leader. Players begin armed with a laser gun with unlimited ammunition and a limited supply of grenades. Improved weapons and grenade powerups are made available within the game, either in plain sight or within crates that must be unlocked using keys. Additionally, crates may contain orbs or one of the six pieces of the Heavy Barrel superweapon. Like SNK&apos;s Ikari Warriors, the original arcade version featured 8-way rotary joysticks.The name of the game is from an in-game weapon. The Heavy Barrel is found in six pieces and is an energy cannon capable of destroying any enemy in the game with a single shot (except the final enemy, and possibly one other boss that may have required two shots). The weapon has a wide arc of fire and can be fired as fast as the player&apos;s trigger finger permits, but after thirty seconds its use is exhausted, at which point the bearer reverts to his previous weaponry. Best used to get past tough bosses, the weapon could be built several times in a single game (probably three or four times). In a two-player game, whoever collects the sixth piece is equipped with the Heavy Barrel.</story>

    <story>Space Fever High Splitter is another of Nintendo&apos;s takes on the Space Invaders franchise only with a twist - if you don&apos;t quite hit the alien in the middle, you&apos;ll split the alien in two, both of which you&apos;ll have to shoot. The alien crafts are arranged in rows and they slowly move left and right across the screen. When the row reaches the edge, the ships drop down a row and move in the opposite direction (one exception - see below). As you shoot more enemies the speed will increase, as will the number of enemy bullets. You have four blocks above you that absorb the enemy shots until they are worn through, and being hit by an enemy shot will cost you a life. Sometimes a UFO will fly along the top of the screen; hit it and you&apos;ll get points and a smaller alien, hit the smaller alien and get more points.[-LF-]There are three different game modes for 1- or 2-player games -[-LF-]Game A - aliens go down two, up one, down two, up one.[-LF-]Game B - aliens show up in one up-and-down row, they add a row each time they reach the edge and turn around.[-LF-]Game C - The same as Space Invaders - all the aliens move as one &apos;block&apos; in the same direction.,</story>

    <story>Hot Chase is an arcade game released in 1988 by Konami.[1] In the game, players drive a white Porsche out of an enemy country to the Border crossing of a friendly one. The car has a bomb attached to it that explodes in a set time. If the bomb explodes, players must restart. There are many obstacles along the way, including railroad crossings, military checkpoints, helicopters that shoot at the car and other cars. The gameplay is said to be similar to Chase HQ.Completing the game resulted in a scene where the hero exits the car, takes his machine gun, and fires at the car to add to the damage before the bomb explodes. Then the game played the following message- Mission Complete. You have succeeded in stealing the enemy armored super car and have crossed the border to freedom. After a few days the enemy surrendered to our country. You will be remembered for your brave deeds. Thanks a million!</story>

Released to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Street Fighter series, Hyper Street Fighter II is a modified port of Super Street Fighter II Turbo in which players can control any versions of the main characters from the five Street Fighter II games previously released for the arcades.

    <story>An abstract racing game in which the player takes on the role of a special government courier, who must deliver a number of secret cargoes to their various destinations at the end of each stage. Gameplay consists of piloting a heavily-armed hovercraft over a series of waterways, avoiding or destroying the enemy craft and barriers that litter each level. Progress is hampered by mines, enemy hovercraft, logs and other obstacles. Money bags can be collected as well as extra fuel.[-LF-]On-board fuel depletes at a steady pace and players must keep a look out for additional fuel cells. In addition to a forward-firing gun, the hovercraft is equipped with a &apos;Boost&apos; function. Providing the player has enough boost fuel, the craft can be made to fly in the air for a limited time; useful for avoiding enemies and barriers, as well as for gaining access to certain bonus items.</story>

After shooting an enemy the enemy&apos;s &apos;soul&apos; (a dark version of itself) attempts to make its way to the top of the screen to an awaiting monster mouth. The player must touch the enemy soul before it gets there or a more difficult enemy is regenerated.[-LF-]Inferno&apos;s maze layout is somewhat similar to Crystal Castles, but without the wide changes in maze height. There seems to be only 3 or 4 &apos;heights&apos; of the maze, which the player can reach via small stairways.</story>

    <story>Space Invaders is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat five rows of eleven aliens—some versions feature different numbers—that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance towards the bottom of the screen. The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens&apos; movement and the game&apos;s music both speed up. Defeating the aliens brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which can continue indefinitely.</story>

    <story>The game play consists of moving robot1984 over all of the red tiles while avoiding objects flying at you from the back of the screen. Eliminating the red tiles diminishes the shield at the back of the playfield which prevents you from flying to the next level. To get to all the red tiles, players sometimes need to leap across empty space which creates a permanent bridge between the two points. Leaps across empty space have to be timed so that the eye of Big Brother in the back of the playfield, which randomly opens and closes, does not see robot1984 and destroy him.</story>

    <story>RETURN OF THE JEDI is a one-player game that features the thrills and excitement of the continuing STAR WARS saga. The new split-wave game-play feature cuts back and forth between two simultaneously occurring action scenes just like the movie.[-LF-]RETURN OF THE JEDI is a one-player game. The player controls the actions Of PRINCESS LEIA, CHEWBACCA, and LANDO CALRISSIAN via the flight control. The player&apos;s main goal is to destroy the DEATH STAR. To do this, the player must travel through a tube in the DEATH STAR and fire a torpedo into the central reactor.[-LF-]RETURN OF THE JEDI picks up the action of the movie at the scene where the rebel forces begin their attack on the Imperial DEATH STAR. LUKE SKYWALKER and PRINCESS LEIA race toward a pair of speeder bikes. In this first wave, the player controls LEIA, guiding her through a forest toward the EWOK village. She is pursued by Imperial STORMTROOPERS also riding SPEEDER BIKES. She defends herself by either bumping them off their bikes, or shooting them. Meanwhile, the EWOKS have set up traps to aid LEIA in her flight through the forest of ENDOR. The traps include ropes stretched between trees that the EWOKS pull tight to upend the riders, and logs that the EWOKS push together to crush the SPEEDER BIKES as they pass between them. LEIA can either bump off the STORMTROOPERS or lead them through the traps. The first vehicle through a trap will escape uninjured, but anyone who follows will be destroyed.[-LF-]Once the player leaves LEIA safely at the EWOK village, he moves to another part of the forest. During the second wave, the player controls CHEWBACCA who is maneuvering a SCOUT WALKER to the bunker where HAN SOLO is waiting to deactivate the shield protecting the DEATH STAR. CHEWBACCA must shoot or avoid logs, which roll toward him. At the same time, CHEWBACCA must avoid rocks catapulted at his SCOUT WALKER. The player can turn the SCOUT WALKER head using the flight control to achieve better aim while firing at the rocks and logs.[-LF-]The split-wave effect occurs during waves two and three. The player controls CHEWBACCA in the SCOUT WALKER, and at the same time, controls LANDO CALRISSIAN as he flies the MILLENNIUM FALCON. At crucial moments, the scene will change from the forest of ENDOR to the skies around the DEATH STAR.[-LF-]While CHEWBACCA is attempting to reach the bunker, LANDO CALRISSIAN is flying the MILLENNIUM FALCON toward the DEATH STAR. LANDO must fight off the IMPERIAL T.I.E. INTERCEPTORS, IMPERIAL STAR CRUISERS, and shuttles. The player maneuvers the FALCON through this traffic, while trying to shoot as many of the Imperial enemies as possible.[-LF-]As soon as CHEWBACCA gets to the bunker, HAN SOLO blows it up, deactivating the protective shield surrounding the DEATH STAR and clearing the path for the MILLENNIUM FALCON. The MILLENNIUM FALCON must enter the DEATH STAR, travel down a tube toward the reactor, and shoot the central reactor to destroy the DEATH STAR.[-LF-]The FALCON is pursued by IMPERIAL T.I.E. FIGHTERS while in the tube. LANDO must avoid the pipe walls of the tube and watch out for falling pipes, energy gates, and turrets that shoot at the FALCON. Upon reaching the target, the player must shoot the reactor energy field, then immediately turn around and fly back down the tube. The flight must be rapid because the fireball caused by the explosion pursues the FALCON.,</story>

    <story>On the planet of the floating cliffs society calls upon its wing-mounted Gladiators to solve conflicts. You, the Gladiator, must enter the fray, participating in a challenge of honor, a JOUST... where only the fittest survive![-LF-]The legend of JOUST continues in JOUST 2. Players must solve the puzzle of what strategy will be most effective in dealing with the buzzards and other winged enemies on each of JOUST 2&apos;s thirty-five different backgrounds.[-LF-]The object of JOUST 2 is to defeat all winged enemies by colliding with them. To survive a collision (Joust), the Gladiators lance must be higher.[-LF-]Defeating a Buzzard Enemy in a Joust causes release of an Egg. Eggs may be caught in the air or collected on landing areas for bonus points. Be Careful! Eggs falling into the Lava form into aggressive mutants, while uncollected Eggs hatch into dangerous warriors.[-LF-]Danger lurks everywhere! Giant Statues come to life; Bats fall out of crystals embedded in the rocks; Lava Trolls and Water Monsters eat unsuspecting bird-mounts; Lightning fills the air; and Unbeatable? Pterodactyls patrol the skies. A gigantic Knight presides on several waves. You, the Gladiator, must destroy him! Hitting all four of his red pins explodes the Knight and all his servants.[-LF-]GOLD EGG FEATURE - A Gold Egg may randomly appear on any wave. Collecting the Gold Egg before it hatches opens a window of awards in the background. To collect an award, step on the red button above the window before a timer expires. Both players reap the benefits of the posted award, which may include bonuses of 1,000 to 10,000 points, &apos;super zapping&apos; all enemies on the screen, or even receiving an extra life.[-LF-]Prepare thyself for War![-LF-]BUY-IN - JOUST 2 is designed for action entertainment for one or two simultaneous players. Players who have started the game may continue where they left off by using the BUY-IN feature. When a player has used all of his lives, he will hear - WISH TO CONTINUE? A 10-second timer appears in the players score area to allow the game to continue by using a Credit, or inserting a coin, before the player presses the START button.[-LF-]LEVEL SELECTION - At the beginning of a game, the player selects, via the FLAP button, one of six different waves, corresponding to the player&apos;s skill level. Then, pressing the START button begins the game. If the player wins the starting wave, he receives an award of points, approximating the scoring from preceding waves.,</story>

    <story>One of many sequels to the legendary Pac-Man Jr. Pac-Man features the character of Pac-Man&apos;s son. For the first time in the series&apos; history, side-scrolling mazes were introduced, with each maze being two screens wide.[-LF-]This time, the mazes have no exit tunnels through which players can make an escape. The bonus items that appear move around the maze and are now something of a mixed blessing, as not only will they destroy any Power Pills they come across, but they will also turn any normal dots they pass over into large dots that slow the player&apos;s movements considerably, but are worth more points than normal dots if eaten by the player. Any mutated dots in the maze will disappear if the player loses a life.[-LF-]The Pac-Man character is once again pursued by four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Tim) in his quest to eat all of the dots in each maze. And as before, numerous Power Pills litter the mazes that, when eaten, allow Jr. to eat the pursuing ghosts.[-LF-]As with previous Pac-Man games, intermissions are featured between certain levels. Jr. Pac-Man&apos;s intermissions are episodic in nature, like those found in Ms. Pac-Man. Jr. Pac-Man&apos;s story tells of the blossoming love between a Pac-Man and a small ghost named Yum-Yum.[-LF-]Act I - Jr. Meets Yum-Yum - Jr. Pac-Man steps outside his home to play. He spots Yum-Yum beyond the fence in his yard and goes outside to meet her. Blinky, hiding in the shadows, comes out from hiding to catch Jr. However Ms. Pac-Man, keeping a watchful eye over her child, sees the commotion from her window and runs out to the yard to eat a Power Pill and chase both ghosts away while Jr. returns to the safety of home. This intermission is played after Round 1.[-LF-]Act II - The Gift - It seems that Jr. can&apos;t get the enchanting young ghost out of his mind, so he proceeds to bring a balloon to her as a gift the next day. Excited to see her, he meets her on a bridge and hands her the balloon, when we catch a glimpse of Blinky lurking behind a bush. This intermission is played after Round 3.[-LF-]Act III - They Escape - Blinky moves from one bush to the another, startling Yum-Yum into releasing the balloon. Blinky attempts to capture Jr. once and for all, but once again, Ms. Pac-Man comes to the rescue. Blinky chases her off to the left, while Jr. Pac-Man and Yum-Yum escape to the right. Once alone, they gaze in to each other&apos;s eyes and fall in love, with hearts appearing all around them. This intermission is played after Rounds 5, 7, and 9.,</story>

    <story>Kaiser Knuckle follows the same fighting game conventions established by Street Fighter II. The player&apos;s character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. The player has a character roster of nine fighters to choose from, and three bosses, each with their own unique fighting style and special techniques. The control layout is set to the six-button standard (a la most Capcom fighting games), but it can be switched to a five-button layout via dip settings. One unique feature is that Kaiser Knuckle was the first and only fighting game that has five strengths of basic attacks.Another unique feature is that it introduced the power zones, which can be utilized via a successful hit of a special move when a player&apos;s Crush Meter is full. The power zones (either fire or electric) can affect the certain special move a character has. Backgrounds can be destructible when players get hit to charge up, and when those meters are full, the next special move that a player connects with his/her opponent will destroy the background&apos;s properties at will (other parts of stages, such as floors and walls are also destructible).</story>

    <story>Karate Tournament is a one-on-one fighting game for one or two players, based on the ancient and most well known of martial arts, Karate.[-LF-]Players enter a karate tournament - having first selected their preferred skill level, from either White, Brown or Black belt - and fight against a number of progressively tougher opponents. Each victory awards the player with a higher belt grade within their current belt colour - white grade six to white grade five, for example - and if the player wins the tournament, he or she is awarded a higher belt colour and the game ends. If players chooses to play the game on the &apos;Black Belt&apos; skill level, defeating opponents is awarded with a higher grade, or &apos;dan&apos; of Black Belt.[-LF-]Karate Tournament uses a distinctive graphical technique in that it &apos;morphs&apos; some of the combatants&apos; movement graphics to simulate speed and motion blur. The game was also unique upon its release in that, in a world of Street Fighters and Mortal Kombats - replete with fantastical special moves - Karate Tournament was a genuine simulation of a recognized martial art; something not really seen since the first appearance of Data East&apos;s legendary genre-defining fighter, Karate Champ, released eight years&apos; earlier in 1984.</story>

    <story>The game puts the bulging-muscled, fire-breathing, ex-circus strongman east-Russian hero on a quest through nine different levels to search for treasures. However, between him and the treasures were several horrendous monsters, including sword-wielding monks, dinosaurs, djinn, hopping fish men and ostrich-riding skeleton warriors.Players can make Karnov walk, jump and shoot his way through these levels and find special items that will help him on his way. He also can collect red orbs with which he can upgrade up to three fireballs at a time. Each level contains a variety of strange enemies, such as gargoyles, tree monsters, will-o-wisps rock creatures, centipede women, and hopping warriors, which Karnov must destroy or avoid. When he reaches the end of a level he usually has to face one or more bosses which he must defeat to beat the level and receive a new piece of a treasure map. In each level Karnov can collect a variety of items along the way, which can be chosen right away or only at certain times. At the end of the game he must face a powerful boss often called The Wizard and collect the treasure.</story>

    <story>The game revolves around The King of Fighters, an elite fighting competition. In this competition, Rugal is defeated and the Orochi are sealed away. The tournament at the centre of the game is sponsored by an unknown patron, whose identity becomes a matter of public interest in the country. Perhaps as a result of this, it attracts a large number of contestants.With the inception of the new multi-shift rule in this KOF tournament, wherein competitors can freely tag off during battles, the competition becomes a &apos;hot topic&apos; and provokes widespread discussion. It also leads to a speedy execution of the match with unified team strategies.In preparation for the tournaments, stadiums with the capacity to hold tens of thousands of people are procured from cities across the world and established in city centres. Schedules are completed and spectators move from one location to another to watch the preliminary matches. To create the atmosphere of a true street fight, competitions are broadcast live on giant screens.</story>

    <story>Killer Instinct is a fighting game developed by Rare and published by Midway and Nintendo. It was released as an arcade game in 1994. The game&apos;s plot involves an all-powerful corporation called Ultratech organizing a fighting tournament. The story was adapted in a limited comic book series published under the short-lived Acclaim Comics imprint.Killer Instinct features several gameplay elements unique to fighting games of the time. Instead of fighting enemies in best-of-three rounds bouts, each player has two life bars. The player that depletes the other player&apos;s life bars first wins the match. The game also introduced auto-seconds, which allows players to press a certain sequence of buttons to make characters automatically perform combos on opponents. Also featured in the game are combo breakers; special moves that can interrupt combos.</story>

    <story>Killer Instinct 2 follows on from the plot line that the previous installment ended with. Eyedol&apos;s death at the hands of Orchid accidentally sets off a time warp, transporting some of the combatants back in time and allowing the Demon Lord Gargos to escape from Limbo. Now, trapped 2000 years in the past, the warriors that survived Killer Instinct, along with several new faces, fight for the right to face Gargos in combat, but Chief Thunder, Cinder and Riptor did not return. Each character that survived the journey from the first game has a corresponding background story, while new characters on this installment are native inhabitants of this past time period. Some fighters, like T.J. Combo who survives from the original, just want to get home. Others, like new character Tusk, want to bring an end to Gargos and his reign of evil. This time there is no tournament or prize money, just a fight to the finish with the fate of the future hanging in the balance.</story>

Like Capcom&apos;s Knights of the Round, it features a level advancement system, allowing character attributes to be upgraded as players progress through the game. The setting is very similar to that of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and other medieval fantasy worlds, with familiar monsters such as Orcs, Gnolls, Harpies, Wyverns, Cyclopes, and Minotaurs.The game was ported to the Super NES and released in 1994. An emulated version of the game was released as part of Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 and Capcom Classics Collection- Reloaded.</story>

Using this information, Heidern decides to focus his efforts in using the next KOF tournament as a way to lure both K′ and Maxima out so that they can be captured and interrogated into telling the authorities about the NESTS cartel.

The tournament at the centre of the game is sponsored by an unknown patron, whose identity becomes a matter of public interest in the country. Perhaps as a result of this, it attracts a large number of contestants.With the inception of the new multi-shift rule in this KOF tournament, wherein competitors can freely tag off during battles, the competition becomes a &apos;hot topic&apos; and provokes widespread discussion. It also leads to a speedy execution of the match with unified team strategies.In preparation for the tournaments, stadiums with the capacity to hold tens of thousands of people are procured from cities across the world and established in city centres. Schedules are completed and spectators move from one location to another to watch the preliminary matches. To create the atmosphere of a true street fight, competitions are broadcast live on giant screens.</story>

    <story>Rugal Bernstein is an incredibly rich and notorious arms and drug trafficker, as well as an incredibly skilled and ruthless fighter. Having become bored with the lack of competition, Rugal decides to host a new King of Fighters tournament. Rugal has his secretary travel to eight destinations around the world and invite fighters to his new tournament. Unlike the previous KOF tournaments depicted in the Fatal Fury series, the new King of Fighters is a team tournament, with eight teams of three, each representing a different nationality, participating this time. Most characters come from other SNK games, such as Team Italy, which is composed of three heroes from the original Fatal Fury- Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard and Joe Higashi. The two heroes from Art of Fighting (Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia) are featured along with their mentor and Ryo&apos;s father (Takuma Sakazaki) make up Team Mexico. Team Korea features Kim Kaphwan from Fatal Fury 2 as the leader of two convicts he&apos;s trying to reform Chang Koehan and Choi Bounge, while Team England is a mix of female fighters from Fatal Fury 2 (Mai Shiranui) and the Art of Fighting series (Yuri Sakazaki, King). The two heroes from Psycho Soldier (Athena Asamiya and Sie Kensou) form Team China along with their mentor, Chin Gentsai. Similarly, Team Brazil features the heroes from Ikari Warriors (Ralf and Clark) along with their commanding officer Heidern. Additionally, the game features two teams composed entirely of original characters- Team Japan featuring Kyo Kusanagi, Benimaru Nikaido and Goro Daimon, and Team USA composed of Heavy D!, Lucky Glauber and Brian Battler.</story>

    <story>The King of Fighters &apos;95 marks the beginning of a story arc that later became known as the Orochi Saga. However, the only elements from the Orochi Saga known in this game is the introduction of Kyo&apos;s rival, Iori Yagami, and Rugal&apos;s use of the Orochi powerRugal Bernstein, thought to have perished in an explosion in the previous game, had in fact survived and sent out invitations to the teams from the previous game signed simply &apos;R&apos;. Only one of the previous teams failed to attend the new tournament- the American Sports Team, now replaced by the Rival Team consisting of Iori Yagami, Billy Kane (from Fatal Fury- King of Fighters), and Eiji Kisaragi (from Art of Fighting 2). Saisyu Kusanagi, Kyo&apos;s father, appears as a fighter for the first time (having made a non-playable cameo in KOF &apos;94) as a computer-controlled sub-boss character. After defeating Saisyu in the arcade mode, it is revealed that Saisyu was being brainwashed and that Rugal will fight once again as a boss character, but as an enhanced version named Omega Rugal.</story>

    <story>A new King of Fighters tournament was announced, though the letters of invitation sent out to the fighters were no longer sent by Rugal Bernstein. The letters also announced many changes, the first of which being a massive overhaul of the tournament&apos;s approach. During the time that had passed between the tournaments since the previous year, the King of Fighters tournament&apos;s fame had grown immensely, to the point that it turned into a major international event, which had not happened before. Huge corporations transformed the King of Fighters tournament into something widely televised, commercialized, and celebrated, drawing in many crowds from around the world. The tournament is now held by Chizuru Kagura- a descendant of the ancient Yata Clan responsible for sealing the Orochi demon along with the Kusanagi and Yasanaki clan (the clans from Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami, respectively). Chizuru uses the tournament in hopes of finding and recruiting Kyo and Iori in order to stop the upcoming Orochi threat, but Kyo and Iori aren&apos;t exactly willing to work together on friendly terms.</story>

Battles end when one of the monsters is pinned for a three count or if time expires (in which case the player loses).The game consists of 12 total levels- the player first must defeat all six monsters, with the last monster being oneself, but in a different palette. Then the player must defeat the six monsters again, in the same order, but this time in different cities.Mega criticised the game, awarding it a score of 10%, with Andy Dyer making the comment unforgivably bad.

    <story>Lady Bug is an insect-themed maze chase arcade game produced by Universal Entertainment Corporation and released in 1981. Its gameplay is similar to Pac-Man, with the primary addition to the formula being gates that change the layout of the maze when used. The arcade original was relatively obscure, but the game found wider recognition and success as a launch title for the ColecoVision console.</story>

    <story>You have an overhead view of a maze with two sides, the sides mirror each other. The left side of the screen is yellow, and the right side is green. On each side are fifteen tanks. The object is to blow up all of the oppossing players tanks (or as many as you can before the timer runs out). You can only control one tank at a time, you can move them around and blast your opponents tanks (getting the active one is usually a good idea). When you get blasted, your tank vanishes, and you must move a little blip over to another tank to resume play (this blip is invisible unless it is against a wall). You can also leave your tank and head for another one by pressing the second button. This is just a great strategic title, it holds up even today. It is really worth playing if you like that sort of thing. Just be aware that this is a two player only title, so you will need a friend to play against.</story>

    <story>A colourful and playable ten-pin bowling game for 1 to 4 players, offering a choice of three scoring methods - &apos;Regulation&apos;, &apos;Flash&apos; and &apos;Strike 90&apos;.[-LF-]The game begins with players selecting either a right or left-handed bowler, before choosing what weight they want their bowling balls to be. Once the match starts properly, Power and Direction meters will appear and players must use both their judgement and timing to select and execute the desired bowl. Timing is key as players are only allowed twenty seconds to make each shot.[-LF-]The &apos;Strike 90&apos; mode awards players ninety points for a strike and sixty points for a spare. In the &apos;Flash&apos; game mode, the points flash across the lane as the players throw the ball. Should they succeed in knocking down the standing pins, the points that are displayed at the time the pins are struck will be added to the players&apos; scores.</story>

    <story>Western style shooting game featuring digitized characters. The game consists of 5 stages - Bank Robbery Stage Hold-Up, Saloon Showdown, Train Robbery, and Hide-Out.[-LF-]The player begins the game holding the rank of Sheriff, but if too many innocents or fellow lawmen are killed, the player can be demoted to Deputy or even Posse member. Complete a stage without killing any innocents, and the player is promoted to Deputy Marshal, further success can eventually lead to the player being promoted to the level of U.S. Marshal.[-LF-]The player&apos;s gun can hold up to 6 bullets at a time. On each stage, there are special items that can be shot to reveal better weaponry, such as double rigs, rifles, 50 caliber sharps, shotguns, gatling guns and cannon. The gatling guns and cannon can only be used once but the double rigs, rifles, 50 caliber sharps and shotguns can be reloaded the same way as your regular 6-gun. Once a life is lost, any additional weapons are lost and the player is once again armed with only a 6-gun.,</story>

    <story>The player controls a sleuth running through a forest, trying to get a Leprechaun&apos;s pot of gold. The pot of gold is randomly placed on the screen. When the pot of gold is touched, the player is taken to the next level. The Leprechaun chases the sleuth through the forest, trying to catch him. If he is caught the player loses a life and starts over from the beginning of the level. After all lives are lost, the game ends. Should the Leprechaun reach the pot of gold first, it is then relocated to another place on the screen. By touching the trees, the player&apos;s score increases, as does the value of the pot of gold. Every time the Leprechaun touches a tree, the pot&apos;s value decreases though the player&apos;s score remains the same. After each level and after every 30 seconds the Leprechaun&apos;s speed increases.</story>

    <story>Lightning Fighters, released in Japan as Trigon (トライゴン?), is a 1990 scrolling shooter arcade game by Konami. It is commonly compared to Raiden, though the two games were released very close to each other, and they were both meant to compete with the works of Toaplan.Though Lightning Fighters has become an obscure arcade-only title, Konami has referenced it multiple times over the years. Gradius Gaiden features a boss modeled after the ship and weapons from the game, and Yu-Gi-Oh! cards such as Trigon, Delta Tri (based on the mentioned Gradius Gaiden boss), and Dragon Laser also represent the game.Stub iconThis scrolling shooter article is a stub.

The primary target of the attack are enemy bases on a rotating planet in the center of the screen. The trackball is used to move a cross-shaped cursor. The fire button fires a missile at the cursor&apos;s location from your closest ship. The shield button is used to activate force fields around the ships. The shield can only take four hits each round, and the count is shared between all ships.At the beginning of each level, the player is flying through outer space and spaceships fly on screen from the left and right and leave in an arc. They try to ram into your ships. Note that shields do not work during this stage.</story>

    <story>The objective of Lunar Lander is to pilot a lunar landing module as it prepares to touch down on the moon. The terrain is very jagged and has only a few flat areas appropriate for landing. These areas are highlighted with a flashing bonus multiplier, which is higher for smaller areas. If the player successfully lands the module, he or she is awarded points based on how good the landing was and the difficulty of the landing site. If he or she crashes, points are awarded based on the severity of the crash and sometimes the player receives a fuel penalty. In either case, the game starts another round with a different set of terrain and the player&apos;s remaining fuel. The game is over when the player has run out of fuel and crashes on the moon&apos;s surface.</story>

    <story>Loco-Motion is basically an updated version of a sliding block puzzle game where the player can move pieces horizontally or vertically within a frame to complete a picture. However, the presence of a constantly moving locomotive complicates matters. The player controls the playfield and the aim is to guide the locomotive around the tracks to collect the passengers waiting at the stations located around the edges of the screen.The player uses a joystick to slide a piece of the track into the vacant square. The locomotive is always moving, but the player has the option of making it move faster to get to the passengers more quickly by using a button next to the joystick. The player must avoid crashing the locomotive into the dead-end barricades (shown as a yellow &apos;X&apos;), and also ensure that it does not run into the edge of the gap or a barrier at the playfield edge, either of which costs a life.</story>

    <story>In Looping, a single player flies his/her airplane into Adventure-Land, battling hot air balloons, rockets, and other high-flying objects in the quest to reach “The End.” An acceleration button, fire button, and a 2-dimensional (up-down) joystick are all you have as you fly your plane over cities, through pipes, and eventually into “The End” itself. Death-defying looping maneuvers can be executed with ease as you attempt to destroy strange flying obstacles and ground targets.The Looping arcade machine contains a series of relatively rare Texas Instruments CPUs and a dedicated DAC (Digital To Analog Converter) sound chip, capable of speaking audible commands to the player throughout his/her mission. The Texas Instruments CPUs are reportedly difficult to find if they need to be replaced, and original hardware is becoming scarce as the years go on.Released in 1982, Looping was one of the two original titled produced by the German company Video Games GmbH. It is said to have been developed in Parma, Italy by Giorgio Ugozoli. It was licensed to Venture Line for US manufacture and distribution, and has seen home release on the Colecovision.An interview with the devloper or Looping, Giorgio Ugozzoli, is available here in English, and here in original Italian!</story>

    <story>A shoot-em-up set in an ancient, South American pyramid, in which the player must explore a large number of single rooms in the search for treasure. Each room is filled with enemy creatures that must be killed or avoided. The player is equipped with a limited amount of whips and must collect as many items of treasure as possible.[-LF-]The player is presented with options throughout the game, depending upon which rooms they wish to enter. Once a path is chosen, players must pick up treasures, kill all the monsters in their way, find the key and exit the room as fast as they can; avoiding the potential of setting off an earthquake. Upon exiting a level, the player is presented with a hallway which shows a number of doorways allowing access to any one of several different rooms. This allows players to pick their own route through the game, but the decision which room to tackle next must be taken quickly as players must reach their chosen room quickly or risk being attacked by a flock of screeching birds.[-LF-]The player&apos;s character is armed with an eight-way firing gun (in a similar fashion to Williams&apos; 1982 classic, Robotron). In addition to the gun, the player is also equipped with three whips, which can be used to either kill attacking creatures or to knock down any walls that bar the player&apos;s progress. Players are given the opportunity to purchase additional whips at the interludes between levels; this is done by inserting an extra credit into the arcade machine and pressing the relevant button.[-LF-]Treasure must be constantly collected in order to stay alive.</story>

When you press the button, any balls on the compartment that one arrow points to are immediately swapped with the contents of the compartment that the other arrow points to. The goal of Lot Lot is to get as many tiny balls (which resemble Pachinko balls) out of grid compartments and down into point slots in order to achieve a designated score, and advance to the next round.</story>

    <story>Lunar Rescue is a combination 2-D simple flight simulator and 2-Dimensional shooter. You start the game by floating within your mother ship. You then either must release your lander or after a pre-determined period of time, the mother ship will forcibly eject it. You first have to navigate through 6 rows of asteroids to make it to one of the landing platforms. You have 6 platforms initially but each landing will eliminate one since there is 1 platform per astronaut you have to rescue. On your return trip up, the screen changes and now you have saucers trying to destroy you with laser fire. Again, you will either have 3 or 6 rows of saucers depending if there are meteors in the area. You then must successfully land in the docking bay of the mother ship to get credit for a successful rescue of 1 astronaut.</story>

    <story>Mace- The Dark Age is a fighting video game released by Atari for arcade machines in 1997 and ported by Midway to the Nintendo 64 in 1997.The game is similar to Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. and the Mortal Kombat series. Like in Mortal Kombat, when a character wins both rounds, they can perform an execution move on the enemy. Methods included severing an opponent&apos;s limbs and torso (Al Rashid), beheading (The Executioner), repeated stabbing (Koyasha), impaling the opponent with a sword (Lord Deimos), breaking an opponent&apos;s back by hoisting them on top of a Viking helmet and throwing them to the ground, causing their body to explode (Ragnar), and some more far-fetched methods including pulling out an opponent&apos;s heart (Xiao Long), shrinking (Namira), transforming the opponent into a chicken (Taria), and entering an opponent&apos;s body and bursting them from inside (Dregan).</story>

    <story>Magical Drop is played in a style and gameplay similar to Compile&apos;s (now Sega&apos;s) Puyo Puyo and Taito&apos;s Puzzle Bobble franchises; a stack of random colored bubbles descend from the top, and a player is defeated when a bubble hits the bottom. Bubbles can be picked up and dropped by the player&apos;s clown at the bottom, and are destroyed when three or more of the same color are put together on a single column. Chains are formed either when a single drop caused a chain reaction, or when more than one group of bubbles is destroyed in quick succession. The game is normally played with two players (one may be a computer opponent), and chains cause the opponent&apos;s stack to descend faster.There are 24 characters, all but the Black Pierrot being named after a tarot card (although the Strength card has been represented by two characters throughout the series). Different characters have different attack patterns. The columns of the opponent&apos;s stack will descend at different rates relative to each other depending on the character chosen. This causes a disjunction of colors that may make it more difficult for the other player to clear their stack. For example, with the character Devil, all the columns will descend at the same rate, whereas with Sun, the middle columns will descend faster than the others.</story>

    <story>The Main Event, known in Japan as Ringu no Ōja (リングの王者, King of the Ring), is a professional wrestling arcade game released by Konami in 1988. A player selects two different wrestlers as their tag team, and they wrestle another tag team. If the player wins, his team moves on to another match. If he loses, he gets an immediate rematch, since the game isn&apos;t over until the player&apos;s energy falls to zero. Some of the game&apos;s most distinguishable features were an oversized Action button which would flash whenever an attack, grapple, submission or pin could be performed; and an enthusiastic announcer who introduced the wrestlers and called the action during matches.</story>

    <story>Mario Bros. is an arcade game published and developed by Nintendo in 1983. It was developed by Shigeru Miyamoto. Mario Bros. features two plumbers, Mario and Luigi, having to investigate the sewers of New York after strange creatures have been appearing down there. The objective of the game is to defeat all of the enemies in each phase. The mechanics of Mario Bros. involve only running and jumping. Unlike future Mario games, players cannot jump on enemies and squash them, unless they were already turned on their back. Each phase is a series of platforms with four pipes at each corner of the screen (in the old version along with an object called a POW block in the center). Both sides of every phase feature a mechanism that allows the player to go off-screen to the left and appear on the right and vice versa.The player gains points by defeating multiple enemies consecutively and can participate in a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has a certain number of enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing its speed to maximum. There are three enemies in all- the Shellcreeper, which simply walks around; the Sidestepper, which requires two hits to flip over; and the Fighter Fly, which moves by jumping and can only be flipped when it is touching a platform. Players may also make use of the above-mentioned POW block, which flips any enemy touching a platform or the floor when a player hits it from below. This item can be used three times before it disappears. Coins appear whenever enemies are defeated and may be collected for bonus points.As the game progresses, elements are added to increase the difficulty. Fireballs either bounce around the screen or travel directly from one side to the other, and Slipices can freeze platforms, causing Mario and Luigi to skid. In addition, icicles start to form under the platforms and fall loose. Bonus rounds give the players a chance to score extra points by collecting coins without having to deal with enemies; the POW block regenerates itself on each of these screens.</story>

    <story>At the end of the Qin&apos;s Dynasty, the government weakened by corruption was attacked by foreign influences. The people were flung into misery and became quite unsatisfied with the situation. They did not believe in the government anymore and turned their faith back to religion.The White Lotus sect saw this as an opportunity and took over. They claimed to help the government to defeat foreigners and bring peace to the world. Their Ideology was quickly adopted. Everything related with the Western world was killed or destroyed. Anyone against this principal was considered an enemy and accused of being bound with the devil. Dragon of Martial Master and Master Huang of Po Chi Lam could not accept these outrageous actions so they band together in order to prevent much bloodshed.One day the leader of White Lotus Sect sent an invitation to Dragon and Master Huang but Dragon&apos;s disciples saw this as a trap and recommended that they wait for Master Huang, who was out of town collecting medicine. The Master did not want to miss this opportunity to make peace and went alone. Unfortunately, he was captured and put in prison. Both parties started confrontations and have struggled since then.Now dangers are hidden all over the place. Who is capable of resolving the situation? Let&apos;s find out!</story>

Using a super computer called God System, the survivors start their first step in rebuilding Earth by having the God System create machines capable cleaning and reconstructing much of what has been lost from the war. However, without warning, a mysterious mutant entity known as N takes over the God System; creating three strange guardian statues based on Greek mythological figures, N manipulates the God System&apos;s machines and programs in order to attack mankind. The survivors create an artificial human called Yukiwo – built to harness perfect dexterity and strength – as well as a super-powered jet for him to pilot in order to reclaim Earth from N.</story>

    <story>Maximum Force is a light gun shooter arcade game developed by Mesa Logic for Atari Games in 1997. In 1998, Atari Games re-released the game as part of one machine called Area 51/Maximum Force Duo that also included Area 51, and later ported the game to both the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn game consoles.Like its predecessor Area 51, Maximum Force is notable for its use of digitized video stored on an on-board hard disk, and the bizarrely contrasting unrealistic gibs into which every enemy blows apart when shot, in exactly the same way. While enemies, innocents, and explosions are 2D digitized video sprites, the levels and vehicles are pre-rendered in 3D.</story>

    <story>SINGLE PLAYER GAME[-LF-]The game-play sequence in MEGATTACK consists of 4 or 5 turns (operator selectable) each of which lasts as long as the player can skillfully maneuver his spacepod to avoid destruction. When he loses a spacepod, the GIP message reappears, accompanied by the GIP sound, and displays the number of spacepods left. After the last spacepod is destroyed, the game-over sound is heard and the game-over message is displayed.[-LF-]Assuming a (4) pod game, play begins with player-scores (00000) and at the top and the (3) best scores displayed across the bottom Eight (8) monsters appear in the upper portion of the screen and move towards the bottom, while dropping their bombs. The player uses his joystick control to move his spacepod across the bottom of the screen. The spacepod will start with the number (4) in the center and the number will decrease each time a spacepod is destroyed so that the number (1) will be in the center on the last round.[-LF-]As the spacepod is moved across the bottom of the screen the player fires his laser energy-beams towards the left, right, and straight-up accompanied by an echoing laser sound effect. The laser beams have unlimited range, covering the entire play-field, and each spacepod has an unlimited number of shots. The (3) laser beams are fired simultaneously. Each fire-button must be released and pressed again to fire a second shot. Also, there is a slight reload delay so that beams cannot-be fired too rapidly.[-LF-]Whenever a laser beam strikes a monster or a bomb, it explodes with a visual flash and an audio blast. If a monster is blasted, the player is awarded a &apos;kill&apos; and his score is increased by the appropriate score (per the scoring menu when a bomb is blasted, no points are scored.[-LF-]When a spacepod is hit by a bomb, it explodes with a growing flash and a reverberating blast. When the spacepod gets too close to a monster, the monster jumps up and sporadically devours it while growling and burping, if a monster reaches the bottom, it bounces across the bottom in an attempt to devour the spacepod.[-LF-]When all the monsters in a given round have been destroyed the screen will turn into a starfield, and small space rings will appear, which if not shot at, hit, and destroyed will grow in size. If any one (1) ring is allowed to reach a predetermined size, it will de-activate the spacepods laser gun, which during these rounds only fires straight up, lift the spacepod off the bottom of the screen, absorb it and then disappear (shrinking in size), thus ending the round. The next round begins with the next wave of monsters. This starfield round occurs between every wave of monsters, and if the player is successful in destroying all the rings the next wave of monsters will then appear.[-LF-]When the spacepod is finally destroyed either by being absorbed, hit by a bomb or devoured by a monster the round is over and the video image returns to the GIP display flashing player (1) up and displaying the remaining spacepods the screen then goes black again and this time the pod with the number (3) in the center appears at the bottom of the screen and play continues as before.[-LF-]During play there are always (8) monsters (max) on the screen, however the monsters attack in waves of 25, after each multiple of 25 kills the starfield or space ring round will appear with each ring worth the same score as the monsters were worth in the previous screen display. The monsters that reappear after each space ring round are a new shape, and color and score more points, and drop a different color bomb, any monsters left at the end of a round will reappear at the beginning of the next round. At the beginning of the game the action is rather moderate to allow new players an opportunity to develop a &apos;feel&apos; for the game. In each succeeding wave of monsters, the bombs begin to fall at an increased rate and the monsters motions are increased.[-LF-]All of these features combine to make MEGATTACK satisfying for the novice, challenging for the expert, and profitable for the operator.[-LF-]TWO-PLAYER MODE[-LF-]The play of MEGATTACK in a two-player game is identical to single-play with the players alternating turns. On the Upright Version, the players use one common set of controls. On the cocktail version there are two sets of controls on opposite sides of the table. The computer activates control alternately between player 1 and 2 and flip-flops the screen image so that it is oriented to the player in control.[-LF-]The GIP message, which appears after each turn, clearly indicates which player is up by flashing it in the player&apos;s color. This also allows time for the players to position themselves at the controls, but is brief enough to avoid unnecessary dead-time. The use of two different player-colors eliminates any confusion as to which player is in control.</story>

The aim of the game was to rescue the former President from rebels in the fictional African country of Zutula, which bears resemblance to the apartheid regime in South Africa. The game has six main levels, plus the final level where your mission is to rescue the former U.S. president from the Hercules Transport. The game&apos;s arsenal include real-world machine guns, shot guns, flame throwers, and grenade launchers. Several missions even have pilotable vehicles available.</story>

    <story>Earth is under attack from an alien race from the &apos;Nemesis&apos; region of space and human civilisation now stands on the brink of collapse. The invaders have utilised energy molecules - known to earth scientists as &apos;Newalones&apos; - to create powerful beam weapons with which to attack Earth. In response, Earth&apos;s scientists have developed the &apos;Black Fly&apos; project; a powerful space craft that utilises the same Newalone molecule technology of the alien agressors.[-LF-]Metal Black is a very playable sideways scrolling shoot-em-up which manages to feel different to other games in the genre, due to the fact that it lacks a a player-definable weapon power-up system. Instead of collecting items that provide extra speed, different weapons etc. players must collect the clusters of &apos;Newalone&apos; molecules that float around each level. These molecule clusters will gradually increase the player ship&apos;s firepower.[-LF-]As long as the Metal Black ship has sufficient firepower, players can activate the &apos;Beam Weapon&apos;, which generates a powerful energy beam that destroys everything it comes into contact with. The Beam Weapon will only last for a few seconds and its use will reduce the ship&apos;s energy levels. Once the Beam weapon de-activates, Metal Black will have vastly reduced firepower for its forward-firing laser cannon. Players must once again collect the Newalone molecule clusters to build up the ship&apos;s firepower.,</story>

    <story>Long ago the evil Vaxxian Empire overran the galaxy. Most of humanity was enslaved and abducted to the Vaxxian homeworld. A few humans, who were scientists, managed to escape. At the current moment (according to the timeline of the game), the Empire has since collapsed. However, numerous Vaxxian space stations, all blindly controlled and defended by robots, still remain in the galaxy, mindlessly pursuing their original orders.The small band of scientists who initially escaped managed to clone the great human hero Major Havoc, in order to fly his Catastrofighter through a wormhole in space, so that he may lead a clone army against the dreaded Vaxxian robots, and to liberate the remnants of humanity by destroying the enemy reactors. The player controls Major Havoc, the leader of this very band of clones.</story>

    <story>M.I.A. is a direct sequel to 1985&apos;s &apos;Green Beret&apos; and like it&apos;s predecessor, is a horizontally scrolling jump and shoot game for one or two players. Special forces soldiers must penetrate several enemy-packed combat zones to reach a POW compound.[-LF-]Upon reaching the compound, the player must infiltrate and rescue the POWs held there, before escorting them safely through a final enemy-packed level to the rescue helicopter that awaits at the end.[-LF-]Unlike &apos;Green Beret&apos;, the two-player game in M.I.A. sees both players fighting side-by-side, instead of the alternate approach of the original game.[-LF-]The game consists of six stages;[-LF-] War-torn battlefield[-LF-] Airstrip[-LF-] Jungle[-LF-] Rail Yard[-LF-] PoW Base[-LF-] Escort the PoW&apos;s to the Helicopter[-LF-]The first four stages are presented in random order and may also be mirrored, so players battle right-to-left instead of left-to-right. This vastly increases variety to the game and adds replay value. The PoW and helicopter stages are always the last two stages. At the end of each level, the players must fight off a flurry of enemy troops and destroy gun emplacements and watch towers. Certain sections of each stage offer players a different route, with both platforms and underground tunnels that can be utilized and explored.[-LF-]As with &apos;Green Beret&apos;, players start each level carrying only a combat knife. Specific enemy troops carry weapons which are dropped when the soldier is killed and can be picked up by the players. The weapons are always carried by soldiers wearing red uniforms, and range from an assault rifle, grenades, a flame-thrower or a bazooka. Players can carry more than one weapon and can cycle through them as needed. Each collected weapon has only a limited supply of shots.[-LF-]After rescuing the PoW&apos;s on the sixth stage, players must escort as many of the escapees as possible to a waiting helicopter, and must get at least one PoW safely aboard the chopper to complete the mission and start a new set of stages.,</story>

You and a three-barrel machine gun are gonna even the score! Bash into Evil Head&apos;s compound, battling tanks, missiles and flying robots in skull-to-skull combat. Crawl through bullet-filled corridors, stomp through flak-laden forests, swing down ladders and dive off ledges to ambush the evil army. The enemy hammers you with heavy artillery, rapid-fire lasers and slashing sawblades. You pound them with flamethrowers, nitro bombs and machine guns - your explosive-tipped bullets tear into their armor. The Head&apos;s forces are vicious and armed to the eye sockets. So what!

    <story>Missile Command is a 1980 arcade game by Atari, Inc. that was also licensed to Sega for European release. It is considered one of the most notable games from the Golden Age of Video Arcade Games. The plot of Missile Command is simple- the player&apos;s six cities are being attacked by an endless hail of ballistic missiles, some of them even splitting like multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), and in later levels smart bombs which can evade a less than perfectly targeted missile. As a regional commander of three anti-missile batteries, the player must defend six cities in their zone from being destroyed.</story>

Kahn agrees to this plan, and even restores Tsung&apos;s youth. He then extends the invitation to Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld.

    <story>MONSTER BASH is a fascinating cartoon theme game featuring colorful graphics in three exciting scenes of hunt-and-hide adventure. Light-hearted, suspenseful music and audio sounds add to the fun, and heighten player interest and intrigue.[-LF-]DRACULA&apos;S HOUSE[-LF-]The player-hero of the game is LITTLE RED, a wily, red-headed boy who chases Dracula throughout his five-story haunted house. Up and down staircases and through Warp Doors leading to secret passageways, Little Red zaps defending bats while attempting to light candles in certain rooms. When a candle is lit a Magic Sword is energized with mystical powers. Little Red must touch the flashing Magic Sword to gain SuperZap power... only a SuperZap will defeat the sly Dracula.[-LF-]FRANKENSTEIN&apos;S CASTLE[-LF-]Little Red enters the eerie castle of the hulking Frankenstein. He pursues Frankenstein around his six-story castle while avoiding the fierce Wolfmen. The tricky Wolfmen can be zapped, but be careful, they can duck under the zap and attack Little Red. Fewer candles are now available to be lit. Warp doors to secret passageways can be used only when they flash. Special jump-down zones allow Little Red to jump down several levels at once, eliminating any Wolfmen in the way as he descends, but Frankenstein can only be defeated with a SuperZap.[-LF-]CHAMELEON MAN&apos;S GRAVEYARD[-LF-]The greatest challenge yet... to dispatch the sneaky Chameleon Man and his horde of Spiders. Entering the spooky graveyard, Little Red finds that only one candle is available for lighting which is found in a crypt guarded by giant Spiders. Chameleon Man changes his color to match that of the background and thus becomes invisible. Little Red must pass over one of the Color-Change Spots to change the background color making Chameleon Man visible again. Chameleon Man can do away with Little Red with a flick of his long tongue. Chameleon Man can only be done in with a SuperZap.</story>

    <story>Atari&apos;s Monte Carlo is a 1-player video game that simulates driving in a grand prix race. Various video-display phrase indicate score, time elapsed (&apos;FUEL&apos;), speed and which track was selected at the begining of the game (eight different ones ranging from easy to hard). Players drive the grand prix car through the streets, while spectators observe from the side. Bales of hay, cola stands, trees, and bushes also line the roadway.[-LF-]Four computer-controlled cars provide challenge - they pass the player&apos;s car at high speed and may cause it to skid or even crash. However, the computer cars are not unfailable and may also skid or crash occasionally. Realistic engine revving, screeching tires and crash sounds accompany game play.</story>

    <story>Moon Cresta (ムーンクレスタ?) is an arcade game released in 1980 by Nichibutsu. A moving starfield gives the impression of vertical scrolling, but the game is a fixed shooter in the vein of Namco&apos;s Galaxian.Incentive Software published a version of this arcade game for many 8-bit home computers of the time. Dempa also released a port of both Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta for the X68000. It was also released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on March 9, 2010 and PlayStation 4(Arcade Archives) in 2014.[2]</story>

    <story>The object of the game is to bump your enemies - space bugs - off the solar base using Motos, your ship. When you bump all of them off, you move to the next base or round. If Motos is knocked off the base, you lose one life. The game is over when you lose all your lives.[-LF-]You can collect power parts or jump parts lying on the solar base by simply having Motos touch them. The collected parts will be displayed in the lower left corner of the screen and you can use them in the next round. Motos can be outfitted with no more than 7 power parts; the more power parts added, the more powerful Motos is. However, Motos can only be outfitted with only 1 jump part per round. With a jump part, Motos can jump over two squares by moving the joystick in the desired direction and pressing the Jump button. One jump on a square cracks the square and a second jump in the same spot makes a hole in the solar base.[-LF-]You can outfit Motos with these parts in the Power Parts or Jump Parts screen displayed at the beginning of each round. Select the number of parts you want by moving left and right with the joystick, and lock them in place by pressing the Jump button. You can use the selected parts for one round only; they will not be available in subsequent rounds.[-LF-]Linger too long on the playing field and Shooting Stars will begin to fall periodically onto the solar base. The Stars are aimed at Motos, and when they miss they crack a square or break a hole in the solar base (like they do to the base behind the Motos logo in the attract mode&apos;s title sequence).</story>

    <story>Moon Patrol is an arcade game originally released in 1982 by Irem and later licensed for release in North America by Williams (Midway). It is a side-scrolling shooter that puts players at the controls of a six-wheeled moon rover that can jump and shoot. The goal is to move through the entire course as quickly as possible while shooting enemies for additional points. Cannons are mounted on the front and top of the vehicle, and both fire simultaneously when the fire button is pressed. Rocks, mines, and pits in the course prevent you from just holding to the right for maximum speed. Rocks and mines can be shot, but pits must be jumped. Some enemies fire shots that create new pits in the course, forcing players to react quickly.</story>

    <story>Mr. Do! is a colourful and addictive maze game in which the player takes on the role of the eponymous Mr. Do a circus clown who must clear each level of either cherries or monsters. The game&apos;s single screen levels are made up of tunnels surrounded by a colourful, soil-like substance. This soil can be dug through to create new tunnels, allowing Mr. Do to escape his enemies and to reach the many cherries that litter the levels. A number of apples are also scattered around each level, and Mr. Do can push them along tunnels (to block and/or kill monsters) or can tunnel beneath them to drop them onto the heads of any pursuing enemies. Mr. Do himself can also be killed by a falling apple.[-LF-]Mr. Do is armed with a &apos;Powerball&apos; that can be fired down a tunnel, it will then bounce around the tunnels until it either returns to Mr. Do, or comes into contact with, and kills, one of the level&apos;s monsters. The Powerball will only return once Mr. Do has tunneled under more soil. As each level progresses, the monsters themselves start to dig tunnels of their own in their pursuit of Mr. Do. Monsters can also push the apples.[-LF-]Each screen has a doorway through which the monsters enter the level. Once all of the monsters have appeared, the doorway will turn into a &apos;prize&apos;, (ice cream, biscuits, etc.). If the player collects the prize, the &apos;Alphamonster&apos; and his four henchmen will appear. The Alphamonster may be in the EXTRA box at the top of the screen or be moving around the screen. The Alphamonster and his henchmen cannot be easily crushed under apples because they tend to eat them. They can be killed individually with the Powerball or by killing the Alphamonster itself, at which point any remaining henchmen will turn into apples.[-LF-]After every three levels, there is a brief intermission in which a tune is played and a large, animated Mr. Do appears, together with some of the game&apos;s monsters. The time to complete each level and the preferred method (monsters, cherries, EXTRA or Diamond) is shown. The paths in the first level resemble a &apos;D&apos;, after this each level&apos;s tunnels resemble a digit, (&apos;2&apos;, &apos;3&apos;, &apos;4&apos; etc.) up to &apos;0&apos; for level 10.[-LF-]A level can be completed any one of several different ways - either by collecting all of the on-screen cherries; by killing all of the monsters, by completing the EXTRA box, or by collecting the diamond. The latter appears only very occasionally (&apos;Special&apos; awards an extra credit).,</story>

    <story>A scrolling &apos;run-and-gun&apos; platform game for one or two players Metal Slug is a humorous parody of war and specifically of World War II and the Nazis.[-LF-]The game features six enemy-packed levels, referred to as &apos;missions&apos;. Players start the game armed only with a pistol, but extra weapons can be picked up and used for greater firepower. Also, at certain points during a level players will find an unused &apos;Super Vehicle-001&apos; - or Metal Slug - tank which can be entered and driven. The Metal Slug is slow-moving but has very powerful weapons. If the Slug takes too many hits it will break down and start to flash, the player must then quickly exit the vehicle before it explodes. The enemy troops also have vehicles at their disposal, such as tanks, boats and helicopters.[-LF-]The levels are littered with bearded hostages who, when rescued, award players with either points bonuses (in the form of medals) or weapon power-ups. Available weapons are Heavy Machine Gun, Flame Shot, Rocket Launcher and Shotgun. Hand grenades are also available.[-LF-]Each level ends with at least one large enemy &apos;Boss&apos; vehicle that takes many hits to destroy. Once the boss has been destroyed, bonus points are awarded for each prisoner rescued. Further bonus points are awarded if the player&apos;s Metal Slug vehicle has survived the boss battle.,</story>

The 2 brave soldiers are called upon to deal with this threat once again, aided by members of the newly founded &apos;Sparrow Squad&apos;, Fio and Eri.[-LF-]Metal Slug 2 improved on much of what made the first game great; featuring more enemies, larger bosses, more weapons, more vehicles, more hostages, more surprises and more humour than its illustrious predecessor.

    <story>The rebellion orchestrated by General Morden to bring about a new global regime is now ancient history, and order and peace has begun to return to the world. Morden, brought back into power, was attempting another coup d&apos;état, but government forces got wind of the plot beforehand and pre-empted the impending assault.Instrumental in squashing Morden&apos;s rebel forces, Marco and Tarma of the Peregrine Falcon Strike Force are ordered to lead the team after their earlier requests for resignation were denied. Although General Morden has been written off as missing by his followers, they have hidden themselves throughout the world, and Marco and Tarma&apos;s abilities and experience are seen as a necessity to destroy remaining rebel strongholds, one by one. Throughout the furious fighting against the holdouts, Marco and Tarma cannot help but suspect Morden&apos;s involvement in this new evil plan for world domination.</story>

    <story>In this the first proper sequel to Namco&apos;s legendary pill eating maze game, players must once again run around a number of mazes, eating all of the pills that are scattered throughout. The ever-present ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Sue) return to hamper the player&apos;s progress. The infamous &apos;Power Pills&apos; are also present and correct, with four appearing in each maze.[-LF-]Namco introduced a number of changes and enhancements over the original game. The first difference is in the main character. For the first time in video-game history, the game&apos;s lead character was female. Ms. Pac-Man is almost identical to the original character with two main differences; she wears a bow in her &apos;hair&apos;, and is also wearing lipstick.[-LF-]Another change from the original is that the bonus fruit items are no longer static but now move randomly around the mazes.[-LF-]Ms Pac-Man features 4 different maze layouts, which alternate every 2 to 4 screens -[-LF-]The 1st maze is only encountered in Rounds 1 and 2, and has 220 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are 2 sets of tunnels in this maze equidistant from the center of the maze. You must clear this maze 2 times before moving on to the next maze.[-LF-]The 2nd maze is only encountered in Rounds 3, 4, and 5, and has 240 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are 2 sets of tunnels in this maze; one set in the lower half, and the other set at the very top. You must clear this maze 3 times before moving on to the next maze.[-LF-]The 3rd maze is first encountered in Round 6 and has 238 dots and 4 Power Pills. Unlike all other mazes, there is only 1 set of tunnels in this maze, slightly above the center of the board. You must clear this maze 4 times before moving on to the next maze.[-LF-]The 4rth and final unique maze is first encountered in Round 10 and has 234 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are 2 sets of tunnels in this maze, directly next to one another in the middle of the maze. The turns at the entrance to the tunnels change the usual immediate accessibility of the tunnels and should be taken in to account. You must clear this maze 4 times before moving on to the next maze.[-LF-]After Round 13, the game alternates every 4 rounds between the third and fourth mazes.[-LF-]Finally, the ghosts&apos; movement patterns are also completely different to those of the original game.[-LF-]As in the original game, intermission scenes will be played after certain rounds. Ms. Pac-Man&apos;s intermissions tell the story of how Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man met, fell in love, and had a baby. Ms. Pac-Man&apos;s intermissions are also preceded by a sign and a title. 3 intermissions are present -[-LF-]Act I - They Meet - Pac-Man, the star of the original game, enters the screen being chased by Inky. Ms. Pac-Man enters from the other side being chased by Pinky. As the 2 of them are about to collide, they quickly move upwards, causing Inky and Pinky to collide. Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man face each other at the top of the screen, and a heart appears above them. This intermission is played after Round 2.[-LF-]Act II - The Chase - Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man are seen giving each other a playful chase. One chases the other in one direction, and they take turns alternating who chases who and in what direction. After three turns, they chase each other twice more at a faster speed. This intermission is played after Round 5.[-LF-]Act III - Junior - Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man anxiously await the arrival of a stork, who flies overhead with a bundle. As the stork is about to pass over them, he releases the bundle, which drops to the ground in front of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, and opens up to reveal a baby Pac. This intermission, which is played after Rounds 9, 13, and 17, would later serve as the introductory sequence to Jr. Pac-Man.[-LF-]No intermission is present between rounds after the 18th one.,</story>

    <story>Marvel vs. Capcom- Clash of Super Heroes is the fifth Marvel Comics-licensed fighting game by Capcom and the third game in the Marvel vs. Capcom series. In contrast to X-Men vs. Street Fighter and Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, the game features characters from numerous Capcom franchises such as Mega Man and Strider, rather than just Street Fighter characters. The game takes place within the Marvel comic continuity, as Professor Charles Xavier calls out for heroes to stop him before he merges with the consciousness of Magneto and becomes the being known as Onslaught, the final boss. The game was developed in late 1997 and first released in January 1998.</story>

    <story>Michael Jackson&apos;s Moonwalker (マイケル・ジャクソンズ・ムーンウォーカー Maikeru Jakusonzu Mūnwōkā) is the name for several unrelated video games, all based on the film of the same name created by U.S. Gold and Sega in 1989 and 1990 that incorporate the personage of and were co-developed by Michael Jackson himself. The arcade version, home video games and home computer versions all differ in terms of gameplay, but the story and concept remain constant. The story, which is taken from the Moonwalker film, follows Michael, using various music and dance related abilities, on a quest to save kidnapped children from the hands of the evil Mr. Big. The games incorporated synthesized versions of the musician&apos;s hits, such as Beat It and Smooth Criminal. The games have now achieved cult status and are remembered for being a memorable point in Jackson&apos;s change to a different stage persona from Thriller, to Bad.</story>

Five Ninja warriors set about destroying SKULL and freeing the World from its grip.[-LF-]Mystic Warriors features five selectable characters, one of which is shown being kidnapped by SKULL once players have made their character choices. What follows is eight levels of platform &apos;run-and-gun&apos; action, with an end-of-level boss waiting at the end of each stage.[-LF-]Players are armed with both Shurikan throwing stars and with a sword for close encounters. Numerous boxes are scattered throughout the levels (or are being carried by enemies), all of which contain bonus items such as weapon power-ups or energy-replenishing food. Other power-ups include an invulnerability shield (known as the Shinobi Shield) which lasts a few seconds and a Smart Bomb power-up, which destroys all on-screen enemies. Some boxes also contain points-giving items, such as bags of money, jewelry and gold.</story>

If one player is playing the game alone, another one cannot join him or her on this area, and if either player dies on it, they will not be able to continue - also, if one player was playing alone and enters his or her initials on the game&apos;s high score table after losing his or her last life and not inserting another coin to continue in time, dying on the Challenging Area, or clearing the Challenging Area, the other player&apos;s score will always be given as 7650 (Namco&apos;s goroawase number, even though, unlike in Toy Pop, Cosmo Gang- The Video, and Lucky &amp; Wild, both scores are not combined).</story>

    <story>The gameplay consists of walking through maze-like areas filled with monsters with a goal of opening the gate leading to the next area. Playing as a bomberman, the player can lay bombs to destroy all of the monsters, which will subsequently open the gate. Destroying blocks in the maze may uncover useful items including remote control bombs, accelerators, hearts, and increased firing range. Neo Bomberman includes Bosses that appear after each zone. Each zone is harder than the last, some featuring new traps and level obstacles such as conveyor belts.</story>

    <story>Mr. Do! (ミスタードゥ Misutā Du?) is an arcade game created by Universal in 1982. Similar in some ways to Namco&apos;s popular Dig Dug title, Mr. Do! was also popular and saw release on a variety of home video game consoles and systems. It is the first game in the Mr. Do series, and was released both as a standalone game and as a conversion kit (released by Taito Corp.) for existing arcade cabinets. It was one of the first arcade games to be released as a conversion kit, and went on to sell 30,000 units in the United States.[1] It was remade in Japan as Neo Mr. Do! (ネオミスタードゥ Neo Misutā Du?). It was also a popular choice on the 1983 video arcade-based game show Starcade.</story>

The original arcade game version used an unusual screen setup that situated one display in between projected images of two other displays, creating the appearance of a triple-wide screen. Versions of the game were subsequently released for a variety of home platforms, including various personal computers, and were mostly well received. A remake known as The Ninja Warriors Again was developed by Natsume and released for the SNES in 1994.</story>

    <story>There lived one gravedigger at a very small village in a remote region. He lived a quiet, solitary life in a corner of the cemetery. He kept away from the village people due to his very ugly appearance. One day, he found the graves were ransacked and some corpses were stolen. He didn&apos;t want the village people to find out, so he decided to eliminate the grave burglars by himself. Thus, he patrolled the cemetery every night.Gameplay[edit]A good ghoul goes around graveyards protecting them from evil doers. The player clears the area and collecting power ups using it to eliminate the enemies. There are five stages with five levels each, and each one of them has you throwing fireballs at ghouls, ghosts, goblins, and zombies. When you keep throwing fireballs at these enemies, they will ignite into a giant fireball, which you can throw at other enemies to kill them, and get the remaining treasure before moving on to the next level. At the end of the fifth level, a boss must be defeated in order to continue the game.</story>

    <story>Holy hell is Nitro Ball a blast to play! Data East took the balls-to-the-walls action of such titles like MERCS and Ikari Warriors and combined it with pinball, of all things. What&apos;s so incredible is that it works marvelously, and everything that makes both genres so much fun individually are seamlessly integrated. For instance, shooting foes can knock them into bumpers or special bonus targets, which earn you power ups and a ton of points. Each of the five stages has a cool theme, like zombies and space aliens, and mimics the length of a pinball field, with a big and nasty boss at the end. This is perhaps the only negative thing to be said about Nitro Ball- it&apos;s too short. The meager selection of play fields, while impressive and fun, are nowhere near enough, and you&apos;re left wanting more.</story>

The player must use a 4-way joystick, to take control of the eponymous Naughty Mouse, who must make it from his own house (at the bottom of the screen) to his girlfriend&apos;s (at the top) - however there are several differently-coloured woodpeckers that hatch from the large eggs positioned on the left and right sides of the screen, and set out to stop him, but the player has a single button with which to make Naughty Mouse jump over them. Some of the ladders may also become electrified after Naughty Mouse has climbed them, forbidding him to go back down them again on pain of death; once he has reached his girlfriend&apos;s house, he will receive the stage&apos;s remaining time as bonus points and proceed to the next stage. The main difference between the two versions is the colour palettes, and stage arrangements.</story>

    <story>In New Rally-X, the player drives a car around a maze picking up all of the yellow flags, of which there are 10, before the car&apos;s fuel runs out. The game-play has a similar feel to another Namco legend, Pac-Man; although in New Rally X&apos;s mazes are much larger and, with each maze having only 10 flags to collect, is more sparsely populated than Namco&apos;s pill-eating legend.[-LF-]In-game opponents consist of red enemy cars that try to ram into and destroy the player&apos;s car, a problem compounded by the fact that enemy cars are faster than the player&apos;s. A smoke screen can be activated which trails behind the player&apos;s car and causes any pursuing enemies to crash. Each maze also has rock formations which, if crashed into, will result in the loss of a player car. A radar display to the right hand side of the playing area shows the positions of both the flags and the enemy vehicles.[-LF-]New Rally X is an update of the 1980 release, Rally-X. The sequel has slightly different graphics to the original game, and has more forgiving gameplay.</story>

The player must again use a steering wheel to take control for a car (but this one does not require a pedal, because it is always moving forwards over the surface of an alien planet), with a lightgun to make it fire shots at the various enemies, that are flying towards it - however, it only has a limited amount of ammunition, which is indicated by that text SHOTS in the top-right corner of the screen. To the left of it, that text SHIELDS indicates your car&apos;s remaining energy; it will decrease if it gets hit by enemies, but will be refilled when it collects a crystal. Once it has run out, the game will end - and to the left of it, that text DISTANCE TO FORT indicates the distance to the robot fortress, at the end of the stage (once you have reached it, this shall change to ENEMIES IN AREA). There are a total of sixteen stages in the game; however, once you have cleared the last one, the game shall start over again rather than end.</story>

    <story>An athletics game featuring 8 tournaments -[-LF-]Interceptor[-LF-]A real life missile defense style-contest as missiles are being launched from a ship, and you must use your mystical powers to stop the oncoming missiles. The outside buttons (1 &amp; 3) make you step to the left or right, and the middle button is fire. Failure to hit the missile results in you being blown up. If you select Sharon from France, most of her clothes would disappear except for the bottom part of her suit.[-LF-]Niagara Jumps[-LF-]The final competition in the tournament. It is also considered to be the most difficult competition in the game. Very similar to the Triple Jump competition in the Olympics. The object is this contest is to make it across the falls. Alternately press buttons 1 and 3 to build up speed, then press button 2 three times. If you don&apos;t time yourself properly, you will sink and drown and you will go down the steep falls.[-LF-]Nonstop Rock Chop[-LF-]You must smash as many rocks as you can before time runs out. Rapidly press buttons 1 and 3 alternately until the gauge is full, then press button 2 to smash the rock.[-LF-]Numan Sniper[-LF-]In this contest, monsters will jump out of the sea from three different locations. Your object, destroy them. Press buttons 1, 2 or 3 varying by their location to shoot.[-LF-]Scud Toss[-LF-]Just as in the Javelin competition in the Olympics. Played on a Track and Field-like field with an only exception -- a missile. Rapidly and continuously press the two run buttons and then push and hold the middle button to set the angle of which you would throw the missile. Again, like Interceptor, if you select Sharon -- then again if she is faulted, she will be missing most of her clothes.[-LF-]Tower Topper[-LF-]Here you are expected to climb up to the building rooftop with the fastest time possible. Press button 2 repeatly to scale the side of a building. If you press it too early -- you won&apos;t move, but if you press it too late -- you will fall off.[-LF-]Turbo Dash[-LF-]Much like the 100m Dash in the Olympics -- only the core elements have slightly changed. You are racing against a drag racer and another player. Press the two outside buttons (1 &amp; 3) in alternate fashion until your RSI (or &apos;special speed&apos;) sets in.[-LF-]VS. Express[-LF-]Very similar to a fimilar scene in the Superman comic books. You must stop the oncoming train using your magical powers and send it in the opposite direction backwards. Press button 2 to stop the train, then hammer the outside buttons to build up power before bunging it back down the track. If you don&apos;t time this right -- the train will run you over.</story>

    <story>The gameplay has you thrown into a particular hitman&apos;s home turf and you must use every weapon imaginable as well as anything you can find in the environment (including the environment itself) to try to kill your competitor. Weapons can be typical like a rocket launcher or machine gun or absurd like a clown cannon or a bowl of hot soup. Despite dealing with a competition about murder, the game has a levity to it in all aspects.The levels are also a star part of this game as they are varied and, in many cases, will begin to collapse as time goes on. This means that if the player doesn&apos;t kill his competition in a set amount of time the level will literally start crumbling around you. The levels take place in various interactive locations, involving inside a plane, a moving train, an office building or even at the circus.</story>

    <story>Out Run (アウトラン Auto Ran?) (also spelled OutRun and Outrun) is an arcade game released by Sega in 1986. It was designed by Yu Suzuki and Sega-AM2. The game was a critical and commercial success. It is notable for its innovative hardware (including a moving cabinet), pioneering graphics and music, a choice in both soundtrack and route, and its strong theme of luxury and relaxation. In retrospective interviews, Yu Suzuki has classified Out Run not as a racing game, but as a driving game.</story>

By picking up C icons, the player can switch between this and a more powerful spread gun that only fires upwards. An energy bar that depletes over time is present in the upper left corner of the screen. When it runs out the player character&apos;s movement slows down for a couple of seconds, after which he dies. Energy is refilled by picking up E icons. P icons dropped by certain enemies power up the player&apos;s shot.</story>

    <story>Over Top is a 2D overhead view on- and off-road racing game. Players can choose from several different vehicle types. Pure racing fans can race in a Ferrari sports car, while motorcycle enthusiasts can race using a bike. Players looking for more exotic vehicles to race can even choose the truck, Hummer, or van. Each vehicle has its own handling characteristics and performs differently on various terrain types.A large screen showing a simplified overhead map of the current course section takes up part of the top left section of the screen. The map shows players their current location as well as the course ahead, giving them a chance to react to turns before they see them. Just before a turn, the game also provides more help in the form of blinking arrows indicating the direction that the course is heading.</story>

    <story>P-47 is a two-dimensional scrolling shooter type of game. You play as the pilot of a P-47. Your mission is to basically destroy as many of the enemies as you possibly can. This means eliminating as many air and ground units as you can. You will be going through four missions (each being broken up into two parts) and at the end of each of these parts is an enemy boss for you to tangle with. Although you have unlimited ammunition, the enemy will make you pay for the invasion into their homeland. You will be able to accomplish this with various power-ups and also a second player (if they buy in). Your mission won&apos;t be easy but it is necessary so you can secure both the skies and ground for our troops.[-LF-]The game is broken up into four missions. Within these four missions, there are 2 parts. One part involves going over land and the other part has you either going over water or being up in the air. Regardless of which part you are on, you will still have to deal with the same basic things. After part two of mission four, the missions will repeat again with mission one.,</story>

    <story>Pac-Land (パックランド?) is an entry in the Pac-Man series of arcade video games, released into arcades by Namco, and its American distributor Bally Midway (now Midway Games), in 1984. It was the first Namco arcade game to use the then-new arcade system later titled as Namco Pac-Land. It was also one of the earlier side-scrolling platform games in video game history, preceding the better-known Super Mario Bros. by Nintendo. Pac-Land features parallax scrolling for some of the background elements, a feature that would not become commonplace until the 16-bit console era began much later.</story>

    <story>The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots (also called pellets). When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. Between some stages one of three intermission animations plays. Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost and the Pac-Man itself withers and dies. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Pac-Man is awarded a single bonus life at 10,000 points by default.Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses. In later stages, the enemies go straight to flashing, bypassing blue, which means that they can only be eaten for a short amount of time, although they still reverse direction when a power pellet is eaten; in even later stages, the ghosts do not become edible (i.e., they do not change color and still make Pacman lose a life on contact), but they still reverse direction.</story>

The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) version represented the first NES game developed in the United States and coincidentally, the Sega Master System version represented the first SMS game developed in the United Kingdom. Paperboy was innovative for its theme and novel controls.[3]</story>

It maintained the same intuitive power-up system of Nemesis, Salamander et. al. but adopted a graphical style that was entirely its own; something that becomes evident at the very start of the game when players can chose to pilot either a penguin or an octopus rather that the traditional Gradius ship. Parodius&apos; eccentricity and unique humour is further demonstrated soon after the game begins; as players face such enemies as a giant belly-dancing woman and a half-cat/half-boat creature.,</story>

    <story>The first in the hugely successful puzzle series from Taito Puzzle Bobble is a game for 1 or 2 players in which the aim is to clear each play area of the colored bubbles that litter it. This is achieved by firing bubbles up the screen - with the angle of trajectory dictated by the player - at the clusters of static colored bubbles that litter each play area. The aim is to forms chains of like-colored bubbles, thus making them disappear. At regular intervals, the bubbles will drop one row down the screen, making life more difficult for the players. The game is over when the bubbles reach the very bottom of the play area.[-LF-]In the 1-player game there are thirty rounds to complete, whereas in the 2-player Vs. mode, the winner is the player who clears their play area first. The addictive yet straightforward game-play mechanic ensured that the Puzzle Bobble games would be the most successful of their genre since Russian programmer, Alexey Pajitnov&apos;s legendary Tetris was unleashed upon the gaming world in the late 1980s.,</story>

    <story>Phoenix is a classic shoot-em-up in the mould of Taito&apos;s Space Invaders and Namco&apos;s Galaxian but takes the concept further with the introduction of progressive stages of play (instead of simply repeating a single playfield over and over with an increasing difficulty level).[-LF-]The player&apos;s ship moves along the botton of the playfield firing upwards. The ship can also utilize a temporary &apos;Force Field&apos; to protect it from missiles and birds. Any Phoenix that collide with the Force Field are destroyed. The Force Field only lasts for two seconds and then cannot be used again for another five seconds.[-LF-]There are five attack waves to each round of play.[-LF-]The first wave begins with a formation of sixteen Phoenix attacking the player&apos;s ship. They drop missiles and dive at the ship in an effort to destroy it.[-LF-]The second wave is a variation of the first, only with a different enemy attack pattern.[-LF-]The third wave begins with pattern of eight eggs that when shot hatch into blue Phoenix birds that then attack the player&apos;s ship. These birds can be destroyed by rocket fire from the ship. If the rocket hits the bird on center, the bird is destroyed. If the rocket hits the bird to the left or right of center, only that wing of the bird is destroyed. The wing will regenerate itself if the bird is not quickly destroyed.[-LF-]The fourth wave is similar to the third, only with two banks of eggs instead of one.[-LF-]The fifth and final wave is the attack of the Space fortress mothership; a huge mothership piloted by a purple-coloured alien that sends down waves of small birds to attack the player&apos;s ship, as well as launching missiles from the fortress itself. The alien is protected by a barrier that must be shot several times before both the alien and mothership are destroyed.[-LF-]Once the mothership has been destroyed, the game starts over with an increased level of difficulty.,</story>

    <story>The player must take control of the Chemic, a small black atom with red spikes which must adhere itself to passing Moleks (which come in four different colours- cyan, green, pink and yellow) in order to duplicate the patterns shown in the centre of the screen; if a Molek adheres itself to the Chemic incorrectly, the player must press the reject button to throw it away. The singular enemy in the game is the Atomic, a malevolent clump of balls which moves randomly around the screen, and will kill the Chemic if it merely touches it - however, the Chemic can counter-attack by adhering itself to a Power Molek (which are slightly larger than the regular Moleks, and first appear in the game&apos;s second world- once the Chemic has adhered itself to one, the adhered Moleks will spin around rapidly, and their speed will decrease to denote the nearing of the Power Molek&apos;s ending time limit). But the Atomic has a nasty habit of splitting up and reforming in order to cover more ground, and even the Power Moleks cannot match up to the Atomic&apos;s deadly Alpha- and Beta-Rays which can instantly cause them to float away (along with the regular Moleks) on contact; there are total of eighteen unique patterns which must be duplicated in the game, and every fourth stage is a challenging stage where the Chemic can fire yellow Moleks in four directions at the Atomic.</story>

    <story>The player controls a red pirate ship that must raid across islands and the sea to capture a treasure chest of gold. Avoid the black enemy pirate ship and live volcanoes.[-LF-]There are seven different stages where you must steal a treasure from one of the infamous pirates including Captain Hook, Captain Kidd, Blackbeard, Long John Silver, Jolly Roger, Pegleg Pete, and The Mad Hackers. After all seven treasures have been captured, there is an intermission where an eye-patched skull and crossbones winks and grins and it says Yar! Har! Har! Har! Dead Men Tell No Tales! After that, the stages start all over again, but with increased difficulty. You have three ships at the beginning of the game and you are rewarded an extra ship at 90,000 points.</story>

    <story>Pleiads is a 2-D space shooter style game. With its many interesting visual and audio effects, this game is sure to challenge the most avid player.[-LF-]Each round of play includes 4 different stages. With the onset of the melodious background tune, the first stage of play begins.[-LF-]Against a backdrop of planets and twinkling stars, the Earth City must be protected from sixteen attacking Martians. These Martian attackers have the ability to transform from flying Martians, to walking Martians, or to UFOs. The walking Martians build barriers across the Earth City. These barriers must be destroyed.[-LF-]The Earth Spaceship can be maneuvered right and left. With the use of the &apos;warp&apos; button, it can be randomly relocated when necessary. These, plus a backup of stationary defense weapons, aid in protecting the Earth City and Spaceship, as well as in destroying the Martian Attackers. When all but the two final Martians have been destroyed, a tone of dusk shades the Earth City. As these two attackers meet their end, the Earth Spaceship ascends into space to meet the challenge of Stage II.[-LF-]In this second stage of play, the Earth Spaceship encounters eight Space Monsters. To destroy these Monsters, they must be hit in the direct center. When a Space Monster with burning wings is destroyed, up to 400 points can be added to your score. When all the Space Monsters have been destroyed, the Earth Spaceship prepares for Stage III.[-LF-]In this third stage of play, the Earth Spaceship is confronted with the Martian Space Battleship and its unseen forces. This Martian Battleship contains five closed chambers, each protected by a rocket flame. Each chamber opens periodically at random, to release a defending reserve of Martian attackers. When a flame below an open chamber is extinguished, point value of the Martian Space Battleship increases. This enemy ship can be destroyed by either eliminating all sixteen Martian attackers, or by extinguishing all five rocket flames. When the Martian Space Battleship finally explodes, the Earth Spaceship moves on to Stage IV.[-LF-]This last stage of play begins with an emergency signal, SOS, SOS, SOS, AT ONCE RETURN TO EARTH. The Earth Spaceship is now ready to be guided on its journey, through a landing corridor, back to its home base. The Earth Spaceship must be carefully maneuvered around other spaceships in order to avoid destruction. Clearing flags will add bonus points to your score. When the Earth Spaceship has been safely maneuvered to its arrival target, 500 to 4,000 points will be added to your score, while bursts of fireworks greet your arrival and signal the beginning of a new round of play.,</story>

    <story>Pole Position is a racing video game released in 1982 by Namco. It was published by Namco in Japan and by Atari, Inc. in the United States. The game popularized the use of sprite-based, pseudo-3D graphics with its rear-view racer format—where the player’s view is behind and above the vehicle, looking forward along the road with the horizon in sight—which would remain in use even after true 3D computer graphics became standard for racing games.</story>

    <story>Pole Position II is a 1-player game using a color raster-scan video display. Game action takes place at 4 different raceways - the Fuji Speedway in Japan the Test Track (an oval track like Indy), the Seaside Speedway (with the Long Beach Pike in the background), and the Suzuka Speedway in Japan. The unique and picturesque scenery around each raceway adds exciting realism to each race![-LF-]The driver drives a Formula-1 race car on each track. Player controls consist of a steering wheel, a two-position gear shifter, an accelerator, and a brake pedal (on the Sit-Down cabinet). The first objective of the game is to finish the qualifying lap as quickly as possible. If the driver beats the time, he qualifies for the race. If he does not qualify, he drives the remainder of his time along the qualifying course.[-LF-]As a qualifier, the driver is ranked according to his qualifying lap time, from position one (the pole position) to position eight. Then the driver&apos;s second objective is to race against the clock and other cars to finish the race laps as fast as possible, and to achieve the highest score possible. The driver earns points for passing cars, driving on the track, and finishing the race with time remaining. The time remaining from the Racing Lap is added to the extended lap time.[-LF-]To start the Play Mode, a driver must first insert the correct number of coin(s) for a game (according to the coin dip switch settings, 1 coin/1 credit is the default for both &apos;Coin A&apos; and &apos;Coin B&apos; dips). Then the driver turns the steering wheel until the track he wants to drive on is highlighted in white. The Play Mode will begin when the driver steps on the accelerator. The driver&apos;s car will appear behind the starting line and a certain amount of time, in seconds (&apos;Game Time&apos; dip switch setting; the default is 90 seconds) will be on the clock. The car must finish the qualifying lap within the time allotted to be in the race. If the driver does not qualify, his car continues on the track until the &apos;Game Time&apos; elapses.[-LF-]If the driver has qualified, just before the race begins, the driver&apos;s car (flashing on the screen) is placed at the starting line with seven other cars. The position of the car depends on the position earned during the qualifying lap.[-LF-]The starting lights flash from red to green, and the race begins. Racing hazards are other racing cars, sharp turns, water puddles, and road signs (all of these hazards also appear during the qualifying lap with the exception of water puddles). As the race progresses, more cars appear on the track. If the driver&apos;s car hits another car or a road sign, the driver&apos;s car is destroyed in an explosion. (Pole Position II adds flying debris to the visual effect.) The driver&apos;s car reappears in a few seconds and the race continues. Driving through water puddles or off the track slows down the driver&apos;s car considerably.[-LF-]Experience will teach a driver which turns on which tracks require slight steering (because they&apos;re banked) and which turns require fast and forceful steering. He jockeys for position with the other racers, while keeping his eye on the clock at the top of the screen. When his time runs out, the race is over. If he has beaten the racing lap time and has seconds remaining, the remaining seconds are added to the extended lap time, which varies depending on the track and the &apos;Extended Rank&apos; dip switch setting.[-LF-]The top score achieved by a driver appears at the top of the screen. The time allotted for the lap is displayed under the top score. Increasing lap time (in seconds and hundredths of a second) and the speed of the car appears last. Each track has its own separate high score list.,</story>

    <story>Pong (marketed as PONG) is one of the earliest arcade video games and the very first sports arcade video game. It is a tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. While other arcade video games such as Computer Space came before it, Pong was one of the first video games to reach mainstream popularity. The aim is to defeat an opponent in a simulated table-tennis game by earning a higher score. The game was originally manufactured by Atari Incorporated (Atari), which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created Pong as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of Alcorn&apos;s work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game.Pong quickly became a success and is the first commercially successful arcade video game machine, which helped to establish the video game industry along with the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. Soon after its release, several companies began producing games that copied Pong &apos;​s gameplay, and eventually released new types of games. As a result, Atari encouraged its staff to produce more innovative games. The company released several sequels that built upon the original&apos;s gameplay by adding new features. During the 1975 Christmas season, Atari released a home version of Pong exclusively through Sears retail stores. It was also a commercial success and led to numerous copies. The game has been remade on numerous home and portable platforms following its release. Pong has been referenced and parodied in multiple television shows and video games, and has been a part of several video game and cultural exhibitions.</story>

    <story>The object of the game is for Popeye to collect a certain number of items dropped by Olive Oyl, depending on the level — 24 hearts, 16 musical notes, or 24 letters in the word HELP — while avoiding the Sea Hag, Brutus and other dangers. The player can make Popeye walk back and forth and up and down stairs and ladders with a 4-way joystick. There is a punch button, but unlike similar games of the period, no jump button. Conversely, Brutus can jump down a level and also jump up to hit Popeye if he is directly above.Despite the feature of a punch button, Popeye cannot attack Brutus directly. Instead, the button is used for the following-Punching destroys items that could hurt Popeye such as bottles, vultures and skulls.Each level has a can of spinach; punching these cans will give Popeye invincibility and he can knock out Brutus just by running into him, although after a few seconds Brutus will swim back out and be ready for action again.In Round 1 (the dock scene) of each three-round cycle is a punching bag, which Popeye can use to knock loose a nearby barrel from its position near the top of the playing field. If the barrel falls onto Brutus&apos; head, the player earns bonus points (based on where Brutus was attacked) and renders Brutus harmless for several seconds.Other licensed Popeye characters in the game are Olive Oyl, Swee&apos;Pea, and Wimpy, though they are mostly decorative and do not add heavily to the gameplay. Wimpy appears in Round 2 (the street scene) on one end of the seesaw in the lower left corner of the field, to act as a counterweight. Swee&apos;Pea floats high above, with bonus points to be earned if Popeye can spring off the see-saw and touch him.Popeye loses a life if he is hit by Brutus or any thrown/flying object, or if he fails to catch a dropped item before it reaches the bottom of the screen.</story>

    <story>In a time when the industrialization of the world had just begun, various inventions appeared and changed the life of the peaceful kingdom. One of them was a propeller that evolved from pure wind generation by using the created electricity to re-rotate it. It was called &apos;The Professional Gear&apos;, or just &apos;Progear&apos;. This invention was the key to conquer the great wide open sky. Another discovery made the ancient dream of the immortal body come true. But it was affordable only by some wealthy elderly. They formed a new council called &apos;the Motorouin&apos; and declared the current government as a corruptive and greedy establishment and that they want to correct it by a new educational system, in order to create a new race of man. So they built a military force to realize the first step of their plan, which was the takeover of the kingdom. The government decided to stop the aggression by putting it&apos;s own army in motion. It was a dreadful battle with many victims. But it was won by the Motorouin. This battle is mentioned in the books of history as &apos;The Punishment of the Sages&apos;.[-LF-]A group of young pilots, actually children whose families were killed in that war, finally decided to fight back. They secretly developed a new powerful weapon which adults were not able to use. They called it &apos;Gun Flyer&apos; and installed it in all of their planes. The Storm of Progear was about to begin!</story>

    <story>Point blank is a puzzle/light gun shooter that is merciless in its pace. The premise of the game is based around quick fire rounds that tests players&apos; accuracy and reactions.The game is structured in a very random manner with four non-related stages being displayed for players to choose from each time they complete a stage. Stages are comprised of accuracy tests such as having to shoot the apple off the head of a far away character with only one bullet or judgment tests, such as killing only bad guys in a sea of good guys. Other stages involve solving puzzles by shooting out keys on a keyboard to spell words.</story>

    <story>In the year 2248, the first recorded sign of extraterrestrial life was discovered coming from Mars. The signal emanated from the planet and from it an object travelled through space at light speed out of the Solar System. Earth scientists read the signal, but not knowing the nature of it, warned the world&apos;s defenses in case aliens traced the signal and followed it to Earth with the intent to destroy.Eight years later, aliens followed the signal to the Solar System and began attacking the human space craft awaiting them along Neptune’s orbit. The battle between the humans and aliens spread throughout the Solar System; within two years of combat Neptune was disintegrated, Jupiter was turned into a star and more than half of Earth&apos;s continents sank from rising ocean levels and the planet&apos;s changing axis as a result. Kaoru Yamazaki, lone fighter pilot of the Dino246, is one of the few survivors left of the Pulstar attack force founded to save the Solar System from the alien invaders; it is through her that mankind may have a chance to survive the alien menace.</story>

    <story>Q bert is an isometric platform game with puzzle elements where the player controls the titular protagonist from a third-person perspective. Q bert starts each game at the top of a pyramid of cubes, and moves by jumping diagonally from cube to cube. Landing on a cube causes it to change color, and changing every cube to the target color allows the player to progress to the next stage.</story>

    <story>The game features Q bert, but introduces new enemies- Meltniks, Soobops, and Rat-A-Tat-Tat. The player navigates the protagonist around a plane of cubes while avoiding enemies. Jumping on a cube causes it to rotate, changing the color of the visible sides of the cube. The goal is to match a line of cubes to a target sample; later levels require multiple rows to match.</story>

    <story>A platform shoot-em-up hybrid from Sega for one to four players, selected from either Joe (yellow), Mary (red), Lee (blue) and Edgar (green). The action takes place over a number of sideways scrolling levels, the bulk of which consist of straightforward platform action. On some levels, however, there are jet packs for the players to collect, and the gameplay&apos;s emphasis switched to that of a standard, sideways scrolling shoot-em-up.The object of the game is to destroy an army of robots that have taken over an Earth colony satellite station. Each level has a boss character that must be destroyed. Upon its death it releases a door key that must be used to exit the level. Weapon and character power-ups can be collected to aid players in their task.Due to its potential for four-player shoot-em-up gameplay, Quartet&apos;s gameplay feels vaguely similar to (though by no means as accomplished as) Atari&apos;s 1985 classic, Gauntlet.</story>

    <story>Race a motorcycle against other bikes, cars, trucks and the obligatory tight time limit. Racing Hero is the spiritual successor both to Sega&apos;s wonderful Hang-On series, and to their most famous racing game, Out Run.Some of Racing Hero&apos;s stages mirrored the racing-through-traffic gameplay of the Ferrari-based racer, for example perhaps the biggest similarity to Out Run is that at the end of each stage, the player can choose which route he or she wishes to take next. This differs somewhat from Out Run&apos;s highly impressive forked-road method. In Racing Hero, the player is presented with a seperate stage-select screen and simply highlights the flag of whichever country they wish to tackle next.</story>

The only player controlled car is a Ferrari 330 P4 type prototype racing against computer controlled opponents driving generic cars. The player would race with fifteen other rivals across the track, all attempting to prevent the player from winning. During some of the courses the player would have the opportunity to activate different controls, which include headlights for night driving and windshield wipers during rainstorms. If the player does not activate these controls when prompted, effects such as a restricted view of the road or a wet windshield will occur.</story>

Fuel is a major obstacle, as running out of it results in game over. Any accident will cause great reduction of fuel, and stopping to refuel will cause competitor bikes to take advantage.

    <story>In Rally-X, the player drives a car around a maze picking up all of the yellow flags, of which there are 10, before the car&apos;s fuel runs out. The game-play has a similar feel to another Namco legend, Pac-Man; although in Rally-X&apos;s mazes are much larger and, with each maze having only 10 flags to collect, is more sparsely populated than Namco&apos;s pill-eating legend.[-LF-]In-game opponents consist of red enemy cars that try to ram into and destroy the player&apos;s car, a problem compounded by the fact that enemy cars are faster than the player&apos;s. A smoke screen can be activated which trails behind the player&apos;s car and causes any pursuing enemies to crash. Each maze also has rock formations which, if crashed into, will result in the loss of a player car. A radar display to the right hand side of the playing area shows the positions of both the flags, and the enemy vehicles.</story>

From a third-person perspective, Rambo would have to blast through contingents of enemy soldiers using various weapons with crosshairs, as well as fight tank bosses at the end of each level.</story>

    <story>Real Bout changes the play controls from the previous Fatal Fury games, reducing the number of attack buttons from four to three- a standard Punch and Kick button, a Strong Attack button which can be either a stronger punch or kick attack, depending on the character. The game retains the three-plane oversway system from Fatal Fury 3, which features a main lane for fighting, with foreground and background planes used to avoid attacks or leap towards the opponent. A dedicated button is now used to make an oversway (or change plane) towards the background or foreground.Real Bout introduces a Power Gauge, which fills up as the player performs normal or special techniques against their opponent or defend themselves, similar to many super move gauges featured in other fighting games. The Power Gauge allows players to perform one of three types of Special Techniques, depending of the level of the Power Gauge.Real Bout also introduces stages with ring-outs, a gameplay feature previously introduced in 3D fighting games such as Virtua Fighter. If the player performs certain attacks on their opponent while next to the boundaries, the character will eventually destroy the barrier keeping the opponent in the ring and be able to knock them out of the stage for an easy win.</story>

They, in turn, also break up into several bombs. As a result, a shower of bombs slowly descends on the country.[-LF-]Player participation during the attack is to destroy all aircraft by firing rocket launcher. During the attack, player is to avoid direct hits by bombs - each of which costs him one rocket launcher. Also during the attack, the player must destroy the red bomb before it lands, or one rocket launcher is destroyed.[-LF-]When MIRV appears, player must destroy it completely - otherwise the landing of any one will cost the player one launcher.[-LF-]SECOND ATTACK BY HELICOPTERS - DROPPING PARACHUTE BOMBS.

    <story>Red Baron is a realistic flying simulation. Your player is a WW1 fighter pilot searching the skies for the enemy. The horizon shifts and tilts as he maneuvers the joystick. Three dimensional hills and valleys sweep by below.[-LF-]Suddenly out of the horizon, an enemy biplane appears. The pilot dives, climbs, lines up the plane in his sights! He fires a deadly hail of tracers and the enemy airplane tumbles to earth.[-LF-]But watch out, there are more coming. The first four planes are relatively slow. As time progresses, the player moves more quickly and the enemy planes take more evasive action, adding to the difficulty and challenge.[-LF-]Next the player faces ground targets. An observation blimp floats into view over a low rise of hills. Bright ground objects start to appear, a tank, a pill-box, then dimmer targets, a pyramid, a building. They make good targets for strafing runs but danger can appear at any time.[-LF-]As the game progresses, tanks, pill-boxes and blimps will begin shooting back. The game is composed of randomly alternating series of ground and plane phases. Finally, the planes will also shoot at the player.[-LF-]There are other dangers too. Dive too low and the player can crash and explode on a mountain. Squeeze the trigger too long and the guns overheat. And an enemy plane can get on the pilot&apos;s tail, almost certain death unless the player is a flying ace.[-LF-]When a player is hit by a returning plane, bullet holes and cracks appear on the screen, his plane plummets to earth and explodes. If an enemy shell finds its mark, the result is the same but the shell remains visible.</story>

    <story>Relief Pitcher is a 1992 baseball video game originally released for video arcades. Versions of the game were also released for the Atari Lynx and Super NES.Summary[edit]Arcade game endingThere are two modes to this game- players can either be the starting pitcher; which is a full 9-inning game for either one or two players or they can be the relief pitcher and do a 12-game season for one player only.An additional relief pitcher mode allows a best of 7 World Series type of play for two players.[2]There are four fictitious teams (Boston Bashers, Houston Dusters, Los Angeles Speeders, and Chicago Strokers) to choose from with its own special strength.[2][3] Players must choose their favorite special pitch and dive into the more complicated mechanics of pitching a baseball. All the ballplayers in the game are fictional. There are many meters to use while determining whether to strike out the batter or give him an intentional walk instead. Batters also have to deal with meters that have to do with offense rather than defense.[2]After playing each game, the player is entitled to a certain level of salary. This depends on how good the player performs out in the field. After winning the playoffs in arcade mode, it shows the final box score with a special game over message inside of it.[4] The commentary in this game is done by legendary baseball announcer Jack Buck.[2]</story>

    <story>Renegade is a video game released in American and European arcades in 1986 by Taito. It is a westernized conversion (including changes to all of the sprites and backgrounds) of the Japanese arcade game Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun (熱血硬派くにおくん?, which roughly translates to Hot-Blooded Tough Guy Kunio[1]), released earlier the same year by Technos. It is an immediate technological predecessor to Double Dragon, and Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun is the inaugural game in the Kunio-kun series (which includes Super Dodge Ball and River City Ransom).Renegade first introduced several trademarks of the beat &apos;em up genre, including 4-directional control, punch-jump-kick play action, and enemies which can sustain multiple hits. It is considered to be one of the most influential titles of the video game industry.[2][3]</story>

    <story>The player pilots a rescue helicopter and must try to rescue numerous airmen who have parachuted into the sea below. The rescue chopper is under constant attack from enemy helicopters, while sharks swim in the ocean below and will kill any floating airmen they come across. Later levels also have enemy subs and ships all intent on foiling the rescue mission. Players must be careful to avoid the falling reckage of any enemy helicopters they have just destroyed, and also need to be wary of hitting any parachuting airmen with their &apos;copter blades, as this will kill the airmen instantly.[-LF-]In a very similar vein to Williams&apos; legendary Robotron, also released in &apos;82, the rescue chopper is armed with a gun that can fire in eight different directions, irrespective of the direction the rescue chopper is flying in. In addition to the eight-way gun, the &apos;copter can also drop missiles froms its underside, which is essential for destroying enemy subs and ships.[-LF-]To complete a stage, players must pick up a set number or failen airmen from the sea (determined at the start of each level) and deposit them safely onto a nearby island.</story>

The goal of the game is to jump out of the plane and land safely on one of the many targets down below. The challenge is to avoid the numerous enemy helicopters that occupy the sky in between your plane and the ground.You control the timing of your jump with the Jump button, at which point your parachutist begins hurtling toward the ground out of control. Pressing the D-Ring button shortly afterwards releases the chute and slows your descent. More importantly, it allows you at this point to control your left/right position via the paddle control to help you avoid the enemies.</story>

The objective is to prevent computer-controlled enemies from stealing eight canisters set in the center of the screen. One or two players control tank-like vehicles while game-controlled pirate tanks rush onto the field and attempt to drag the canisters off the edge of the screen. Enemies can be defeated by shooting or colliding with them. The game speed and difficulty increase with each successive wave until all the canisters have been taken (ripped off).</story>

A second gives the players more destructive power. Some stages have a vat of toxic chemicals that can mutate any player character into a huge purple bat-like creature called V.E.R.N (Violently Enraged Radioactive Nemesis) for the duration of the stage.,</story>

    <story>Road Fighter (ロードファイター Rōdo Faitā?) is a car-based arcade game developed by Konami and released in December 1984.[1] It also was the first car racing game from Konami. The goal is to reach the finish line within the stages without running out of time, hitting other cars or running out of fuel (fuel is refilled by hitting a special type of car). The game also spawned two sequels in its time, Midnight Run- Road Fighter 2 in 1995 and Winding Heat in 1996, respectively. A Japan-only rebooted sequel was also released in 2010, 14 years after Winding Heat.</story>

    <story>The player takes on the role of the Road Runner - from the much-loved Warner Bros. cartoon series - and must outrun and outsmart the villainous Wile E. Coyote, in this abstract sideways-scrolling racing game from Atari. A variety of traps and pitfalls await the Road runner (such as a cannon, land mines, cliff-top drop etc.) which must be carefully avoided. It is possible, however, to lure Wile E. Coyote into these traps to put some valuable distance between the Road Runner and his pursuer. Road Runner must also eat the piles of seed that appear at various points throughout the stages, as missing five bird seeds will cause Road Runner to faint and result in the player losing a life.Road Runner&apos;s colourful, beautifully-drawn graphics capture the spirit and humour of the legendary cartoons perfectly. The music and sound effects are also faithful to the cartoon series.</story>

    <story>RoboCop is a 1988 run and gun/beat &apos;em up hybrid arcade game developed and published by Data East with permission from Ocean Software. Other reworked versions appeared for home computers and video game consoles, most of them handled by Ocean, as well as a NES version ported by Sakata SAS and published by Data East. It has more recently appeared on mobile phones.The games capture the spirit of the RoboCop film to some degree, as it involves killing generic criminals and enemy bosses, like the dangerous ED-209. Being quite popular, RoboCop was followed by several sequels (most of them handled by Ocean), including RoboCop 2, RoboCop 3, and RoboCop versus The Terminator which was developed for, but never released in arcades, and was later ported to several other consoles including the Sega Mega Drive, Super NES, Nintendo Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, and even as a final generation title for the Sega Master System in Europe.</story>

    <story>Robot Bowl was a black &amp; white bowling alley game designed and programmed by Edward Valeau and Howell Ivey of Exidy. The game featured one or two robot bowlers playing with the standard bowling rules. To control the outcome, the game had five buttons- left, right, shoot, hook left, and hook right. Hooking the ball was the key to getting a good score, as you could only hook the ball after it had been thrown. This made it easy to pick up a spare, but the game made up for it by making splits very common.Robot Bowl was available in two different dedicated cabinets, an upright and a cocktail, both of them used the same internal hardware.The Robot Bowl upright was of the common 1970s &apos;short cabinet&apos; design, as the machine had no marquee and was only as tall as the monitor. Some machines also had a decorative &apos;ball return&apos; on the front at the very bottom of the cabinet. There is an interesting story behind that. At the time the game was created, Exidy had just purchased Fun Games and had a number of cabinets left over from one of Fun&apos;s driving games. They used these cabinets to get Robot Bowl into production quickly. The only problem was that the cabinets had a hole in the front where the gas pedal had been. Michael Cooper-Hart suggested that they silk-screen the words &apos;Ball Return&apos; over the hole.The Robot Bowl cocktail was a square box with a perfectly round top. The player controls were on either side of the monitor (and you actually had to look at the game sideways to play). This machine had no decoration of any kind.</story>

    <story>The object of the game is for the player to maneuver his white robot in 1 of 4 directions within a maze, capture a red character robot as they move about the maze, and race to the center to change the 9 white balls located there to red. The player may only change one white ball to red at a time after he has captured a red robot, and must evade 4 chaser monsters in the process. Bonus point may be earned when capturing the elusive &apos;red king&apos; that appears on the screen. Capture him and momentarily immobilize the chasers, but do not come in contact with the yellow robots--or your much-needed red robots will be changed to white and force you to change strategy. Play is over when the chasers have captured all of the player&apos;s robots. But, should the player be successful in changing all of the balls in the center to red, the pattern clears and a different challenge is presented. A 3x3 or 4x4 tri-colored pattern will appear at the bottom of the screen and a slightly different tri-colored cube of corresponding size will appear at the center of the screen. The player may earn bonus points by moving the directional arrow and rearranging the colors of the cube at the center of the screen to match the sample pattern presented at the bottom of the screen. The player is given 90 seconds to rearrange the cube as many times as he can. Action returns to the maze whether you win or lose the cube challenge. All in all, an exciting and challenging game where patience and skill are required.</story>

    <story>A sprite-scaling racing game based heavily on the Taito classic, Chase HQ, Round Up 5 sees a single player take on the role of a law enforcement officer who must arrest five criminals.[-LF-]As well as the Miami Vice-esque gameplay theme, Round Up also borrows the fork-in-the-road level design of the Taito classic; an idea that was itself taken from Sega&apos;s 1986 legend, Out Run.</story>

    <story>Route 16 is a challenging race car game, integrating special features to excite the beginner as well as the seasoned player. The vivid video screen is fascinating, and is complimented by exceptional audio during game play.[-LF-]The red car is controlled by the joystick feature, and is pursued through 16 different routes (mazes) by three chase cars. The search mode reveals an overview of all 16 routes, and the search mode appears whenever the car exits a route. In the search mode, the player car becomes a red cube, and the chase cars become yellow cubes.[-LF-]Whenever the player car exits one route, there is a one second delay for a total overview of the game.[-LF-]Each route has dead-ends, zig-zags, and multiple entrances and exits.[-LF-]Some routes have the dollar symbol ($), and the player scores 200 points each time this symbol is cleared. The dollar symbols randomly chance to oil slicks, and when encountered, the oil slicks slow down the player car.[-LF-]The question mark symbol (?) is surrounded by check points and will either reveal a bomb symbol or a bell mark after the player car clears the check point. The bell will add 800 points to the player&apos;s score when cleared. Player skill is tested here to avoid the bomb if it appears.[-LF-]Some routes have a flag symbol, and when the player car clears the symbol, the pursuing cars become dollar symbols, and every effort should be made by the player to chase them down, and add extra points to his score.[-LF-]One route has a flickering bonus car symbol. When the symbol appears, clear it and earn an additional player car.[-LF-]One route has an additional game feature. When the player car enters the maze, it is pursued by an attacking monster. The player car cannot clear or collide with the monster, but must avoid it, or be destroyed.[-LF-]The high-speed button is another feature of Route 16. When pushed, the player car is accelerated to escape the chase cars. Usage of the high-speed button reduces the player car&apos;s fuel. At the end of each round, bonus points are added to the player&apos;s score for remaining fuel.[-LF-]After all the symbols are cleared, the round ends. In successive rounds, additional dollar symbols ($), and additional enemy chase cars are added.</story>

    <story>Unlike in most other shoot &apos;em ups, there are no power-ups. All weapons are available from the start. Weapons can &apos;level up&apos;, however, becoming more powerful as the player uses them to score points. There are a selection of 7 weapons that can be used at any given time-The game is designed so that there is almost always a &apos;right&apos; weapon for any situation. The bosses in the game are designed so that they have multiple &apos;sections&apos; which, if all destroyed before the &apos;core&apos; of the boss, will award the players with point bonuses. Being able to apply the right weapons on any different boss is key to obtaining these bonuses. For example, a boss may have two sections located on either side of the screen. You could immediately go up to one and begin shooting it with a vulcan, or you could hover in the centre and hit both at the same time with the side bombs. This would increase your chance of obtaining the bonus before the time limit runs out and the boss self-destructs.The game rewards players for chaining enemies of just one of three colors, red, blue, or yellow. Whenever the player kills three enemies that are of the same color, who can obtain a points bonus. This also facilitates faster upgrading of weapons.</story>

    <story>Like the original Salamander, and as opposed to the Life Force releases, Salamander 2 abandons the selection-bar based power-up system, in favor for a simplified system that focuses on powering weapons up based on specific icons. For example, the player cannot increase his ship speed until a speed icon is picked up; additional speed icons further increase the ship velocity.Several weapons, when additionally upgraded, turn into a &apos;super&apos; weapon for approximately ten seconds. If the player has the ripple laser, and then gets another icon for it, the player will receive the high-powered Buster ripple for a short period of time. Options have been slightly changed with the arrival of &apos;option seeds&apos;, which are small options that orbit the ship firing only the basic initial shot. Two option seeds can combine into one full option. Moreover, options can also be sacrificed to utilize a short-term homing beam weapon.Several enemy bosses typical to Gradius games return, including the Brain Golem (the first level boss) and the Tetran (the second level boss). There are a total of six levels. Since the game is similar to its prequel, Salamander 2 does not use the Revival Start feature from Gradius (which pushes the player back to a pre-determined checkpoint if a life is lost), many people consider this title to be easier than other titles in the Gradius series due to this. Once the game has been completed, it starts its second-loop at a much higher difficulty. The music is also changed to remixed versions of Salamander&apos;s music in some stages. The first player&apos;s ship is called Vic Viper while the second player&apos;s ship is Super Cobra.</story>

    <story>Samurai Shodown III was to be the start of a bold new direction for the franchise.The most obvious difference between this game and the others in the series is the notably darker aesthetic. The more light-hearted characters (Earthquake, Cham Cham, and Gen-an to name a few) from the previous games have been excised, and even the kabuki master, Kyoshiro Senryo, received a redesign, transforming him from a flamboyant stage performer into a grim-faced, muscular man. All of the characters have been completely redrawn. The animation is very smooth for all characters, another departure from the graphical style of the second game.</story>

    <story>The most significant addition to the fighting system, is the defense button. This button—depending on the position of the joystick—allows the player to duck, quickly jump back, quickly jump forward or roll. This gives more tactical possibilities and balances the player with more evasive moves, rather than loading the buttons with attacks. Clearly, Yuki&apos;s strategy game experience was shown in the new fighting system. Brought back from the original two SS games, is the combination of the A and B buttons to create a fierce slash attack rather than having its own button, like the last two SS games. The C button is once again a kick.</story>

    <story>Super Breakout allows the player(s) to select any one of 3 different action-packed Super Breakout games by turning the game select knob on the control panel to the desired game. The 3 available Super Breakout modes are the following -[-LF-] Double Breakout - before serving the ball, the Double Breakout playfield contains 52 orange bricks (4x13) at the top of the screen and 52 green bricks (4x13) immediately below the orange brick wall.[-LF-]Two paddles are displayed at the bottom end of the screen. When the serve pushbutton is pressed two balls are served. If the first ball served is missed, it counts as a missed serve and goes against the players allotted serves per game; otherwise the second ball is served. If the second ball served is missed after striking the first served ball, the player may continue with the first ball.[-LF-] Cavity Breakout - before serving the ball, the Cavity Breakout playfield contains 44 orange bricks and 52 (4x13) green bricks located immediately below the orange brick wall. At approximately 3 columns in and 2 rows down into the orange brick wall, from both the left and the right side of the wall, two cavities appear. These two cavities occupy the space of 4 bricks (a 2x2 brick area).[-LF-]One paddle is provided in this game, and only one ball is served, unlike Double Breakout. When enough bricks are removed to release a captive ball from its cavity, the score doubles for each brick removed by any of the two balls in the playfield (as long as the served and freed ball remain active in the playfield). If the third ball is freed and all three balls are played in the playfield, the score triples. If any one of the balls is missed and lost, the score returns to double points. If the second ball is missed and only one ball remains in the playfield, points are then scored as normal.[-LF-] Progressive Breakout - before serving the ball, the Progressive Breakout playfield contains 4x13 brick walls (one blue and the other green). The blue brick wall, which consists of 52 bricks, is at the top. Then occurs a space equivalent to this wall. In the middle of the screen is a green brick wall consisting of 52 bricks.[-LF-]The brick walls move or &apos;scroll&apos; toward the paddle at a rate determined by the number of hits on the ball. As the bricks are knocked out and the walls progressively creep up on the player&apos;s paddle, new bricks enter the playfield at a progressively faster rate; four rows of bricks are always separated by four rows of blanks.[-LF-]As the brick walls scroll down, their colors change which indicates a new point score for that brick at that instant of time.</story>

It was a video game update of an earlier coin-operated electro-mechanical (em) Midway game, Sea Devil, itself based on Sega&apos;s 1966 coin-op electro-mechanical arcade submarine simulator Periscope. Midway&apos;s video game version was designed by Dave Nutting and eventually sold 10,000 video game arcade cabinets. A color sequel, Sea Wolf II, was released in 1978 that sold another 4,000 units.</story>

    <story>The game screen is a side view of a underwater scene (with the surface towards the top). You control a crosshair at the surface level. The object is to shoot as many ships as possible before the time runs out. Your torpedoes are launched from the bottom of the screen, and must move upwards to hit the enemy ships (while avoiding the mines that float at different levels of the water). There are several different types of enemy ships, from slow moving destroyers, to fast moving PT boats. An &apos;explosion&apos; light will flash inside your periscope each time you score a hit. Your submarine can shoot five shots before it has to reload (an automatic action that takes about a second). Your game will be extended if you reach a certain score before time runs out (the score is operator adjustable).,</story>

    <story>It&apos;s Street Fighter as you always remember it, with some new moves, characters and combo systems, as well as a more polished look and feel.The new moves available for each fighter, called Super moves, allow them to fire off very powerful moves. A bar at the bottom of the screen represents the power that you have to use for the moves. You start the first round on 0, and each attack that you make adds power to the bar. Once you reach level 3, you can unleash the special attacks, that can sometimes KO the opponant.The other major change over the Street Fighter 2 series are the Alpha counters. These can be used to counter an on-coming attack after blocking.</story>

    <story>The Street Fighter EX fighting system uses fighting systems of the Street Fighter II and Street Fighter Alpha series. In many ways, EX still plays like a 2D fighting game, but the linear plane in which characters fight often changes along a 3D battleground. The game uses special moves and super combos familiar or similar to previous games in the series. Like in Alpha and Darkstalkers, the super combo gauge, used to do Super Combos and other moves, was divided into three levels. The game introduces various new features to enhance the player&apos;s combat choices.</story>

    <story>Street Fighter EX2 Plus retains all the characters from the original game, with the exception of Hayate, who was removed from the game. Nanase now serves as a regular character in his place. Bison, along with Pullum Purna and Darun Mister, who were all excluded from the original Street Fighter EX2, return in EX2 Plus. Sagat makes his debut in the EX series along with new characters Vulcano Rosso (an Italian martial artist) and Area (a young girl equipped with a large mechanical arm). A non-selectable version of Bison named Bison II appears in the game as an opponent in single-player mode.In addition to the Super Combos and Excel Combos in the original EX2, EX2 Plus also features Meteor Combos, more powerful Super Combos which can only be performed filling up all three stocks of the Super Combo gauge. While the previous EX games feature characters who had Lv.3-only Super Combos, in EX2 Plus it became a standard feature for all of the characters, with each character having at least one Meteor Combo. The Excel Combo system from the original EX2 was also revised slightly. The player can now connect a basic move or special move into the same move instead of being limited to a different move.</story>

    <story>Street Fighter III- New Generation (ストリートファイターⅢ NEW GENERATION?) is a fighting game in Capcom&apos;s Street Fighter series, originally released as coin-operated arcade game in 1997. Street Fighter III was produced for the CD-ROM-based CP System III hardware, which allowed for more elaborate 2D graphics than the CPS II-based Street Fighter Alpha games (the previous incarnation of the Street Fighter series), while revamping many of the play mechanics. The game, which was designed as a direct sequel to Street Fighter II, initially discarded every previous character except for Ryu and Ken (hence the New Generation subtitle), introducing an all-new roster led by Alex.</story>

    <story>Shinobi (忍 -SHINOBI-?) is a side-scrolling action game produced by Sega originally released for the arcades in 1987. In Shinobi, the player controls a modern day ninja named Joe Musashi who goes on a mission to rescue his kidnapped students from a group of terrorists. Shinobi was later adapted by Sega to their Master System game console, followed by conversions to other platforms such as the Nintendo Entertainment System, PC Engine, and various home computers, as well as downloadable emulated versions of the original arcade game for the Wii and Xbox 360. The success of Shinobi inspired the development of various sequels and spin-offs.</story>

    <story>Shogun Warriors plays similarly to some other 2D versus fighting games during its release, which the player&apos;s character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. It is controlled with an 8-way joystick and 4 buttons that perform weak and strong versions of punches and kicks. In one player mode, after selecting a character, the arcade randomly selects an opponent. The opponent order goes randomly and always leaves the last four bosses in a certain order. Some characters stabbed by ones armed with katanas or other sharp weapons can cause blood to spurt out, which became popularized a few months later by Midway&apos;s Mortal Kombat. The main unique feature of Shogun Warriors is its grabbing system. When the player is grabbed by the opponent, the grabber must move the joystick left and right to make it more difficult for his opponent to escape, while the one being grabbed must rapidly press any or all buttons to make it easier to escape.</story>

    <story>An evil alien race called the &apos;Bozon&apos; are trying to wipe out Mankind and Lieutenant Henry and Sergent Sanders are given the responsibility of saving the Human Race. They each climb into a Mobilsuit - a jet-powered, heavily armoured combat suit - and set out on their mission.[-LF-]Side Arms is a horizontally - and occasionally vertically - scrolling shoot-em-up for 1 or 2 players. Each player has 2 fire buttons, one for shooting ahead and one for shooting behind; crucial for a game in which enemies attack from all directions. Shooting certain enemies will reveal power-ups - displayed as &apos;POW&apos; icons - and shooting the icons will either change their type, or reveal a special weapon.[-LF-]Finally, Side Arms features a unique power-up. These power-ups are hidden in the level and can be collected by shooting at their location with any weapon. By collecting a circle icon that flashed between the Greek &apos;Beta&apos; and ok, both players can join together to become a single, highly powerful combat unit capable of firing in 8 different directions. When a 2 player unit is joined, BOTH players&apos; controllers can control the unit&apos;s movement, which can cause the unit to not move if players decide to go in different directions to each other. The player who picks up this power-up will control the main weapon from his current list only and the other player will be able to fire the secondary 8 direction weapon. The 8 direction weapon can be fired by single presses or automatically by holding either fire button.[-LF-]In a 2 player game, this form will break apart after one hit to the unit, returning to both players individual units. In a 1 player game it will break apart after 2 hits, causing the second unit to be destroyed.[-LF-]Apperance of the super unit and the 8 directional weapon is dependant on which player gets the power-up. First player unit is a primarly orange unit that fires red triangle projectiles one way. Second player unit is blue that fires blue boomerangs that fly out and return causing a slower rate of fire.[-LF-]The 8 available power-ups are -[-LF-] Speed-up (POW symbol)[-LF-] Speed-down (Reverse POW symbol, shows just before reaching Auto I or II)[-LF-] Bit - (3 level power-up)[-LF-] Spread Gun - (3 level power-up)[-LF-] Mega Bazooka Launcher (2 level power-up)[-LF-] 3-Way Shot (2 level power-up)[-LF-] Auto I (Chain gun)[-LF-] Auto II (3-Way Auto),</story>

    <story>Side Trak is a black &amp; white man-versus-machine game where the goal is to pick up all of the waiting passengers with your train while avoiding the computer-driver killer engine which aims to take you out in a head-on collision. You can control your train via the fast button which allows you to temporarily increase your speed on the tracks. You can also use the joystick to switch between several tracks at various junction points.Each time you make a complete circuit around the track and pass the start marker on the outside track, another car is added to your train. Passengers picked up from the outermost track are worth 10 points. Passengers picked up from each successive inner track are worth an additional 10 points. On top of that, passengers picked up when you have additional cars in tow add another 10 points to car.Side Trak is the first of several games that were developed on a common Exidy platform which would eventually become host to their most popular games. Early revisions of the platform — Side Trak included — had custom sound generators tailored for each game, along with a primitive tone generator that could play one of two very short preprogrammed sequences of notes. (Later games eventually included a common sound system.)</story>

Between one and four players take on the role of either Homer, Marge, Lisa, or Bart in this colorful, horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up from Konami. Each Simpsons character possesses an attacking move specific to them; Marge is armed with a vacuum cleaner, Lisa has a skipping rope, Bart has his skateboard, and Homer fights with his fists. The players must battle their way through a variety of Simpsons-themed levels - such as Springfield and Krustyland - fighting goons, thugs, zombies, drunks, firemen, and several Simpsons regulars. Many Simpsons characters that don&apos;t appear as enemies have &apos;cameo&apos; scenes in the game (Otto working at a burgerstand in Krustyland, for example). The archetypal &apos;boss&apos; character awaits the players at the end of every stage. The game ends with a final showdown with the evil Mr. Burns in his luxurious mansion.</story>

    <story>The player pilots a lone spacecraft, and must create Sinibombs by shooting at drifting planetoids and catching the crystals that are thereby released. Sinibombs are needed to defeat the game boss, Sinistar, an animated spacecraft with a demonic skull face. Sinistar does not exist at the start of the game, and is continuously under construction by enemy worker ships. Though time is crucial, attempting to mine too quickly will destroy a planetoid without releasing any crystals. Enemy worker ships are also gathering crystals (often stealing them from the player) which they use to construct the Sinistar. Enemy warrior ships can directly attack the player&apos;s ship. The player is given a head-start before the enemy ships have enough crystals to begin construction. Game ends when the player&apos;s ships are all destroyed.Once the Sinistar is completely formed, a digitized voice makes various threatening pronouncements, including Beware, I live!, I hunger, coward!, I am Sinistar!, Run! Run! Run!, Beware, coward!, I hunger!, Run, coward!, and a loud roaring sound. The Sinistar has no weapon attacks, but if it contacts the player&apos;s ship while it darts about the playfield, the player&apos;s ship will be eaten and destroyed. A total of 13 Sinibombs are required to destroy a fully built Sinistar, although an incomplete Sinistar can be damaged to slow construction. Each short-range Sinibomb automatically targets the Sinistar when fired, but can be intercepted by a collision with an enemy ship, enemy fire, or a planetoid.The player moves from one zone to the next each time he defeats the Sinistar. A sequence of four zones repeats continuously after the first zone. Each is named for the most numerous feature of that zone- Worker Zone, Warrior Zone, Planetoid Zone, and Void Zone (the Void Zone is especially difficult because it has very few planetoids). Beginning with the first Worker Zone, a completed but damaged Sinistar can be repaired/rebuilt by the enemy ships by gathering more crystals, extending its lifespan if the player is unable to kill it quickly.</story>

    <story>Sky Kid is a 2-D scrolling shooter type of game. You play as the character Sky Kid. Sky Kid flies around in a bi-plane and is assigned specific targets during the missions. These missions involved bombing specific targets. This would seem easy, however, there are a few obstacles Sky Kid must overcome to get to the target safely. First, the bi-plane is not equipped with the bomb. Sky Kid must pick up the bomb enroute to the target. Second, there are both ground and air units that attempt to keep Sky Kid from accomplishing his mission. Last, Sky Kid may have to navigate through some very inhospitable terrain or navigate around cities in order to get to the target. The targets that Sky Kid must bomb will either be a fortress complex or a ship. As one moves farther up in the missions, it isn&apos;t uncommon to have multiple targets in one mission. Perhaps barnstorming would have been a better idea.,</story>

    <story>Sky Raider is a two-dimensional, vertical scrolling game. You get to be the pilot of a bomber whose task is to destroy as many targets as possible in the allotted period of time. Fortunately for the player, it is a target-rich environment and the best part is that there are no defenses to fly through. That means you get to bomb targets at will without fear of any enemy fire.

    <story>Professional wrestling experienced a sudden increase in popularity during the early 1980s, where many professional wrestling organizations were started all over the world. A severe rivalry existed among the organizations.In order to resolve this conflict, 8 organizations combined to form the Capcom Professional Wrestling Association (CPWA), led by Victor Ortega, the CPWA’s first champion.One day, Ortega suddenly vanished. He was considered to be the axis of the sport and his unexpected disappearance caused the CPWA to enter an age of confusion and disorder. The BPWA, a dark underground wrestling organization, chose to take advantage of this opportunity and began moving. With Fighters of Muscle Bomber = Destiny as the theme, the CPWA chief executives decided to hold a world tour called the “Crash Carnival,” to decide the new king of the CPWA.The gong that determines the new “Master of Muscle Bomber” is sounded…</story>

    <story>In the center of the screen is a sun. Any space ships or ship&apos;s fire coming in contact with the sun are destroyed. The sun exerts an increasing gravitational pull as play progresses.[-LF-]A player controlled space ship is randomly located on the screen. The space ship&apos;s movement is controlled by rotate right, rotate left, and thrust buttons. For quick escapes, the space ship can be thrust into hyperspace, causing the ship to disappear and then reappear in a different location.[-LF-]The space ship possesses two weapons. The first weapon consists of shots fired by pressing the fire button. These shots will destroy any alien ships they strike, but will disintegrate if they do not hit any targets. The second weapon is a nuke which is launched by pressing the nuke button. The nuke will continue to travel across the screen until either it strikes a target or the player detonates the nuke by pressing the nuke button a second time. The nuke will destroy all alien ships within a limited radius of the explosion.[-LF-]At the top of the screen is a display showing the player&apos;s score, the number of ships remaining, and the number of nukes a player has available.[-LF-]The game consists of different phases. Each phase begins with several alien ships appearing from random points along the edge of the screen. The number of the alien ships is determined by the phase, with a maximum of eight ships for any single type of alien ship in a phase.[-LF-]The alien ships move across the screen in a random pattern. After a predetermined time, dependent upon the phase, the alien ships will begin to chase the player&apos;s space ship. The player must shoot the alien ships before his ship is rammed by an alien ship. In later phases, the alien ships can shoot at the player&apos;s space ship as well as ram it.[-LF-]Any alien ship that is destroyed by the player will leave a survivor. The player can either capture or kill the survivor. Survivors cannot be killed with nukes. If the survivor is neither captured nor killed, it will begin to drift towards the sun. Survivors disappear when they come in contact with the sun.[-LF-]If the player does not shoot any alien ships, one or two ghost ships will appear and begin to chase the player&apos;s space ship. The ghost ship will shoot at the player&apos;s space ship during any phase. The length of time it takes for the ghost ships to appear shortens with each phase, until at least one is always present. A ghost ship will not leave a survivor when it is destroyed.[-LF-]During a phase, seven different types of alien ships will appear. It is possible for several types of alien ships to be on the screen at one time. A phase is completed after all the alien ships have been destroyed or a specific amount of time has elapsed.[-LF-]A player must be careful when using hyperspace. Excessive use will cause hyperspace to lock-out for a short period, making a player&apos;s space ship more vulnerable. A player&apos;s space ship cannot be destroyed in hyperspace.[-LF-]As play continues, each phase becomes successively more difficult; the number of alien ships increases, the length of time before the alien ships attack shortens, and the alien ships firing capability activates. When a player&apos;s space ship is destroyed, play resumes at the same point. The game ends when all of a player&apos;s space ships are destroyed.[-LF-]1- and 2-player options are available. In the 2-player mode, players alternate until all their ships are destroyed. If 1-player receives more extra ships than another, he will be allowed to play the extra ships even though his opponent&apos;s game is over.[-LF-]An extra nuke is awarded every 10,000 points. An extra space ship is awarded after capturing a specified number of survivors.</story>

    <story>A superb and addictive platform/puzzle game in which a single player controls a wizard called &apos;Dana&apos;, whose quest is to retrieve Solomon&apos;s key and vanquish the demon hordes that have broken through into the world. To achieve this Dana must advance through the fifty rooms of &apos;Constellation Space&apos;, before finally reaching the magical key.[-LF-]Each room has a key that Dana must collect. Once collected, the room&apos;s exit will open and the wizard must then try to find and/or create a safe route past the constantly spawning demons to reach the exit and progress to the next room. To enable him to do this, Dana is armed with a magic wand that can be used to both destroy and create granite blocks to use as platforms and barriers. Dana can remove existing blocks with his wand, and can remove blocks directly above him by repeatedly jumping up into them until they shatter.[-LF-]Bonus Items litter each room, as well as being hidden in granite blocks, and collecting these will earn the player for extra points. Power-ups can also be found and picked up. These appear as potion bottles with a flame emblazoned on them. When used, Dana shoots a fireball which will start moving along the walls and platforms and will destroy the first demon it comes into contact with.[-LF-]As well as the bonus items and power-ups, each level also has a hand bell which, when collected, will trigger the release of a trapped fairy. The fairy will slowly fly around the room and can be rescued for bonus points. An extra life is awarded for every ten fairies rescued.[-LF-]The game&apos;s levels are set around the Zodiac star constellations. The main levels are divided into groups of four - making a total of fourty-eight standard rooms - with each group representing a separate constellation. In addition to the standard rooms, each constellation also has a secret bonus room that can only be accessed by finding the given constellation&apos;s &apos;Seal&apos;, which is located in the last room of each group. There are three further secret rooms - &apos;Page of Time&apos;, &apos;The Page of Space&apos; and the &apos;Princess Room&apos; - that are only accessible if the player has found the &apos;Hidden Seals of Solomon&apos;.[-LF-]The four room groups are -[-LF-]1-4 Aries 5-8 Taurus 9-12 Gemini[-LF-]13-16 Cancer 17-20 Leo 21-24 Scorpio[-LF-]25-28 Libra 29-32 Virgo 33-36 Sagittarius[-LF-]37-40 Capricorn 41-44 Aquarius 45-48 Pisces</story>

    <story>SegaSonic the Hedgehog (セガソニック・ザ・ヘッジホッグ SegaSonikku za Hejjihoggu?) is an isometric platform game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, released by Sega for Japanese arcades in June 1993. The game supported three players playing simultaneously, and possessed a unique track ball set up for moving on-screen characters.[1] The only other control input was a single button, allowing the player to perform a jumping attack. The use of the trackball has subsequently led to great difficulty in emulation efforts, with Sonic creator Yuji Naka stating it as the reason for it not being included on future compilations or rereleases, such as Sonic Gems Collection.[2]Gameplay in SegaSonic the Hedgehog has been likened to the game Marble Madness.[3] Up to three players can play as either Sonic the Hedgehog, Mighty the Armadillo or Ray the Flying Squirrel, as they are kidnapped by Dr. Eggman and placed on an island filled with death traps that they must escape from. The game, played in an isometric perspective, is controlled using a trackball to control a character&apos;s direction and speed and a button used to make the character jump into a Spin Attack. Using these controls, players must try to make it to the end of each course whilst avoiding traps and staying ahead of the danger behind them. Each character has a life bar which goes down if the player falls into traps, with the player losing a life if the bar empties. Health can be recovered by collecting rings that are littered around the course or hidden inside obstacles or enemies. A bonus is awarded if the player collects over a certain percentage of rings within a level.</story>

    <story>Space Duel is an arcade game released in 1982 by Atari Inc. It is a direct descendant of the original Asteroids, with asteroids replaced by colorful geometric shapes like cubes, diamonds, and spinning pinwheels. Space Duel is the first and only multi-player vector game by Atari. When Asteroids Deluxe did not sell well, this game was taken off the shelf and released to moderate success.The player has five buttons- two to rotate the ship left or right, one to shoot, one to activate the thruster, and one for force field. Shooting all objects on the screen completes a level. Space Duel, Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe and Gravitar all used similar 5-button controlling system.</story>

    <story>Space Firebird is a one or two player game in which players are attacked from all sides by highly maneuverable Firebirds. Players can move space ship left or right and shoot a rapid-fire laser at attacking Firebirds. A special Warp Mode allows the space ship to escape danger and fire at the flock of aliens.[-LF-]FIREBIRDS[-LF-]The space Firebirds are a unique set of adversaries. There are three different birds, the Emperor, Eagle and Gull, which fly together in complex looping formations, firing and attacking from all directions. The player must keep track of the laser hits because each bird has a different resistance level to hits. The fearless Emperor is destroyed by four hits, the Eagle with two hits and the soaring Gull with one hit. The Eagle also has a deadly bomb which is launched at the space ship. Extra points are scored by hitting the bomb before it explodes. The bomb when hit, scatters into deadly shrapnel. To avoid the flying shrapnel, the bomb must be hit from directly underneath.[-LF-]SPACE SHIP[-LF-]The space ship can be moved right or left to evade attacking Firebirds. Depressing the fire button enables the space ship to shoot its laser at approaching Firebirds. Players receive 3 (adjustable) space ships per play.[-LF-]WARP MODE[-LF-]Activate warp mode to escape impeding danger or to strike out at approaching birds. There is only warp mode per space ship. When activated, the space ship is launched into space with a force field around it that deflects enemy fire. In warp mode, Firebirds can be eliminated by ramming into them or by firing at close range.[-LF-]If all Firebirds are destroyed, the player moves into a new battle sequence that increases in difficulty. One new space ship is awarded for a score of 5,000 (adjustable) points. Game ends when all space ships are destroyed.</story>

    <story>The Earth is under attack from alien invaders. Shoot them out of the sky before they land. Space Fever is Nintendo&apos;s take on the Space Invaders franchise. The game is almost identical in terms of how it plays. The alien craft are arranged in rows and they slowly move left and right across the screen. When the row reaches the edge the ships drop down a row and move in the opposite direction. As you shoot more enemies the speed will increase, as will the number of enemy bullets. You have four blocks above you that absorb the enemy shots until they are worn through, and being hit by an enemy shot will cost you a life. Sometimes a UFO will fly along the top of the screen and can be hit for Bonus points.[-LF-]There are three different game modes for 1- or 2-player games -[-LF-]Game A - There are two &apos;blocks&apos; of aliens that move in opposite directions to each other.[-LF-]Game B - The aliens move as one &apos;block&apos;, but they only appear one row at a time.[-LF-]Game C - The same as Space Invaders - all the aliens move as one &apos;block&apos; in the same direction.,</story>

    <story>The player controls a spaceship battling alien spacecraft. Like other early similar arcade games, it is controlled by four buttons- rotate left, rotate right, thrust and fire. The game was particularly unique in that the player could choose different upgrades for the first three levels. One upgrade would allow the player to shoot in a three-way pattern, another would allow the player to fire forward and backwards, and the third would allow all the firepower to be concentrated in the front.At the conclusion of the following round, the player would then pick up another shell, although multiple ones could not be used together. The different firing patterns made each round seem slightly different. Between rounds and during the attract mode, the alien commander would taunt the player through the use of synthesized speech. The game continues indefinitely but stops calculating the score after the completion of level four.At the beginning of each level a synthesized excerpt from Aaron Copland&apos;s Fanfare for the Common Man is heard.</story>

    <story>Spatter is a fast-moving maze-chase game in which the player takes on the role of a tricycle-pedalling child out collecting flowers, while trying to avoid collisions with the numerous enemies giving chase.[-LF-]Most of the maze paths are seperated into two lanes, with a springy elastic fence seperating them. This fence is the key to playing the game, as players can jump into it, allowing them to squeeze past oncoming enemies in the same lane. Also, enemies on the opposite side of the fence can be sent flying from the track. Solid blocks also feature, and these can be pushed into enemies to destroy them.[-LF-]Special bonus rounds feature after stages two, six, ten and fourteen. These rounds are platform-based, with the player trying to collect as many items of fruit as possible before heading up to the highest platform, to meet up with a friendly eldery lady who is waiting there. &apos;Fruit&apos; and &apos;Happy&apos; bonuses are then awarded.</story>

    <story>Spectar, released by Exidy in 1980, is the follow-up of Targ. Gameplay is apparently unchanged, you control a vehicle called Whummel into a 9x9 grid maze, chasing down, and being chased by, the alien invaders. Targs have evolved into the more dangerous Rammers, and Spectars appears more often, shooting at player&apos;s ship.You use a 4 way joystick to guide your vehicle in the maze, and a pushbutton to shoot at enemies. Up to two players can alternate in gameplay.The most noticeable difference from his predecessor is that to complete a level you must now collect all the gems in the maze, in a Pacman-like game. Rammers and Spectars continue to appear from flashing pods, so you cannot rest and plan your course easily, or you will be overwhelmed by the alien force.Graphic is highly improved compared to his predecessor- the maze now has barricades that must be avoided or can be used as a shielding against the enemies, and has ten environement settings, changing from the square-block town of Targ to a city, a forest, a lunar landscape and many more. The enemies too are smarter and faster, and the fact that they go on spawning from the pods makes the game a even more frenzy challenge.</story>

    <story>Speed Freak is a monochrome vector arcade game created by Vectorbeam in 1979. It is a behind-the-wheel driving simulation where the driver speeds down the computer generated road past other cars, hitchikers, trees, cows and cacti. Occasionally a plane will fly overhead towards the screen. One must avoid crashing into these objects and complete the race in the alloted time. The player can crash as many times as he wants before the time runs out and players were treated to two different crash animations. The first was a simple cracked windshield effect, the second was a crash where the car explodes into car parts that fly through the air.</story>

This is different than the original Sprint 2, which allowed you to select your track manually. The graphics are simple black and white with two shades of gray thrown in for good measure.

    <story>In this game you control a race car on a semi-complicated track. You are looking down on the action from above. Your only goal is to drive around the track as many times as possible and as fast as you can. There will be eight cars on the track at all times. With the computer controlling cars for missing players. The sheer number of cars can make this game a little confusing. All the cars have minor variations to set them apart from the others, but are similar enough that you simply cannot look away from the track for a second. If you are used to the other Sprint games, you will find that this one is a bit different, the graphics are slightly higher in resolution, and the tracks are much more complex, and have a different look to them, not to mention the fact that this version adds a brake pedal that was absent in the other Sprint titles.

    <story>The third sequel to Taito&apos;s seminal Space Invaders Super Space Invaders &apos;91 leaves the classic Invaders game-play intact, but adds a slew of new alien invaders and power-ups to the mix. This, together with the vastly improved graphics that introduce colorful new backdrops - some of which scroll vertically in a similar fashion to the star-field in Namco&apos;s Galaxian - ensure that SSI 91 is a worthy sequel to the legendary original.[-LF-]The original game&apos;s flying saucer still makes an appearance, but instead of merely awarding bonus points when shot - as in the original game - it now drops a power-up pod for the player to retrieve. Power-ups include shield, faster shots, a laser (activated with the second button) and a giant butterfly, which freezes the invaders for a limited time.[-LF-]One of the game&apos;s most memorable features was the &apos;Cattle Mutilation&apos; bonus screen, in which the player must protect a heard of cattle from a number of fast-moving saucers, intent on stealing the animals. If a cow is snatched; the player must shoot the relevant saucer to free it; being careful not to actually shoot the cow itself. The &apos;91 incarnation also introduced &apos;bosses&apos; to the series for the first time; giant, screen-filling aliens that required several shots to kill.[-LF-]Another major difference to the previous games in the series is that if an invader reaches the bottom of the screen, the player will simply lose a ship (in the original, the game would end once an alien had landed). Also, the player&apos;s ship now comes equipped with a shield that can withstand several hits. The shield&apos;s strength is depleted every time it takes a direct hit from one of the invaders, and too many hits will result in the shield disappearing altogether. A direct hit on an un-shielded ship will result in the loss of a player life.,</story>

And they&apos;re helped by hordes of bandits, gunslingers and horse thieves, so pack loads of lead. Track those rotten skunks through an Indian village, on a steaming locomotive, and down the mean streets of lawless Reechforem Gulch. Occasionally, dynamite is at your disposal, as well as weapon power-ups. But cattle stampedes and sneaky traps could end your adventure in a cloud of dust. Oh, and be sure to carry ointment for your saddle sores because you&apos;ll ride horseback in a galloping bonus stage filled with handy items.

Each horse is rated in strength, speed, and stamina, making each horse different in handling. During the game, horse ratings can be boosted through completing bonus levels. Each horse has a stamina bar displayed at the bottom of the screen, next to a picture of the horse&apos;s head showing its current health. The stamina bar decreases as the horse runs, and when it is depleted, the race is over for that horse.</story>

Choosing from one of the game&apos;s selection of horses, players must compete in a series of races on different tracks to earn money and prestige. Each horse that players can select is rated according to speed, stamina, and burst.Players control their horses with the joystick and three buttons. Pressing the A button repeatedly keeps the horse accelerated with a slight drain of the stamina bar, while pressing the B button applies the rider crop to the horse. This results in a slight burst of speed at the cost of draining the horse&apos;s stamina bar faster.</story>

    <story>Star Fire is an early color game programmed by David Rolfe with graphics designed by Ted Michon and Susan Ogg. It was released by Exidy in 1979. Star Fire is a first-person space shooter where your mission is to seek out and destroy enemy spacecraft while avoiding incoming missiles.If a number of elements of Star Fire seem similar to Star Wars, your eyes are not deceiving you. Star Fire was originally designed as a Star Wars game, with the eventual hope that either a license would be purchased or that they would change enough of the elements to avoid any legal entanglements. Originally, the authors had hoped that Midway would pick up the game for distribution, but they passed and instead Exidy purchased the game and released it.Star Fire was the first game to come in an environmental cabinet, designed by Michael Cooper-Hart. Even more importantly from a historical perspective, Star Fire was the first game to keep a high score list where the player could enter his or her initials. Prior games had tracked the concept of a high score, but Star Fire was the first to let you personalize the high score entry and display a top ten list with your initials next to your high score.An update to Star Fire, simply called Star Fire II, was intended to go into the last run of Star Fire units. It features a more refined high score display and easier high score input.</story>

    <story>In the year 2348, humans have been exploring the vast reaches of outer space for the past four centuries and have established peaceful contact with various alien civilizations. People now emigrate from one planet to another and life is generally good. However, some problems arise with a couple of alien races, so the Earth Federation begins its research in creating a Plasma-power weapon to help protect the Earth from any possible outside threats. Dr. Edward Bilstein- a Nobel Prize-winning German-American prestigious physicist for the Earth Federation, uncovers the secret to humanity&apos;s sixth sense- a technique for capturing the energy of the human mind and discovers how to use it as an energy source he calls Plasma Power. The specific Plasma weapon is built, using mental power as its basis and that Bilstein is able to gain fame and fortune for the invention, but it is soon discovered by the Earth Federation that Bilstein had experimented on actual human bodies during his research on Plasma Power and that he&apos;s immediately arrested and exiled from Earth, being imprisoned in a floating prison satellite that orbits the Planet Zeta while the development of the specific Plasma weapon is indefinitely suspended. Word of Earth&apos;s possession of a super weapon immediately spreads throughout the universe and that it instantly reduces hostile confrontations while the name Dr. Edward Bilstein is completely forgotten from within the minds of everyone. However, four years later, a report from Zeta states that an Earth Federation army base from upon the planet was attacked and immediately destroyed by a small group of rebels calling themselves the Fourth Empire and that Bilstein, who had built himself a powerful cyborg body and managed to escape from the floating prison satellite on Zeta, is the one who&apos;s leading this group of dangerous individuals. With several other similar reports coming from other nearby planets and realizing that the specific pattern of attacks is leading right back to Earth, a panicked Earth Federation has only one recourse- to find people who could utilize Plasma Power in their own given accord and attempt to stop Bilstein from within a last, desperate effort before the mad genius can invade and conquer Earth and the rest of the universe with his nascent Fourth Empire. All of Earth&apos;s hopes rest in the project codenamed Star Gladiator.</story>

    <story>Star Hawk is a 3-D wireframe shoot-em-up which places a strong emphasis on player timing. Players move a cross hair around the screen and must blast the approaching enemy spaceships.[-LF-]The skill level settings affect how quickly the cross hairs move in response to the joystick input. As the game progresses, the speed of the enemy craft increases. If one particular enemy ship is not destroyed quickly enough, it will zap 800 points off the player&apos;s score, with the enemy itself also worth 800 points.[-LF-]Star Hawk can effectively be played indefinitely, providing the player keeps shooting enough enemy ships.</story>

    <story>STAR TREK is a 1- or 2-player SEGA Color X-Y video game with computerized speech synthesis. The player finds himself the Captain of the Starship Enterprise, his mission being to rid the universe of a number of threats to the United Federation of Planets.[-LF-]STAR TREK has a unique method of displaying the information vital to the game play. This method involves the separation of the CRT into three completely separate screens.[-LF-]The Scanner is where the player sees a top down or plan view of local space, with the Enterprise always in the center of this screen. The Viewer is where the player sees actual apparent 3-D images, as if he were looking out the ships front window. The Status screen displays player score in addition to Shield strength, number of Photon Torpedoes, and amount of Warp energy remaining.[-LF-]The game begins by introducing Klingons, Starbases and the Enterprise into the Scanner with an exciting shrink down animation sequence. The Enterprise starts with 1 to 4 Shields and Photon Torpedoes (switch selectable). By actuating the rotary knob and depressing the Thrust button the player may maneuver about the Scanner screen.[-LF-]In order to destroy enemies the player may use either of two weapons - Phasers (the Fire button) or Photon Torpedoes. Each has unique properties.[-LF-] Phasers are instantaneous, can destroy only one enemy at a time, and are in unlimited energy supply.[-LF-] Photon Torpedoes require time to travel, can destroy many enemies, and are in LIMITED supply. Displayed in the Status screen, Photon Torpedo supply appears as a red bar (squares).[-LF-]For high speed, the player may depress the WARP button. While this button is held down the Enterprise moves very quickly and cannot be damaged in any way by anything. A blue bar in the Status screen displays the amount of Warp energy available, and shrinks as the Warp button is held down.[-LF-]The Enterprise is shrouded by an automatic Shield, which protects the Enterprise from enemy fire and collisions. The Shields are displayed in the Status screen as green line segments (a bar). Once the strength of the Shields is depleted, the ship can sustain damage. When damaged, the Enterprise looses ship functions in the following order - Shields, Photon Torpedoes, Warp Drive. If all of these are damaged, the next hit will destroy the Enterprise and end the game.[-LF-]In order to repair this damage the player may choose to dock with a Starbase. Docking is accomplished by merely flying into a Starbase. The DOCKED message appears, all damage is repaired, and a Shield unit, Photon Torpedo, and some Warp time are added to the ship?s supplies. Although only four of each supply unit is displayed at any one time, 255 can be collected.[-LF-]The primary enemy is the Klingon Battle Cruiser, which comes in three colors -[-LF-] Red Klingon - ignores the Enterprise and sets out to destroy a Starbase, after which the Klingon turns purple.[-LF-] Purple Klingon - ignores Starbases and attempts to destroy the Enterprise by firing plasma energy balls. Purple Klingons will stop a certain distance away while attacking so as not to risk collision. After a certain period of time (depending on round), purple Klingons turn white.[-LF-] White Klingons - sometimes known as Maniac Klingons, these Klingons will move VERY QUICKLY and attempt to ram the Enterprise.[-LF-]Anti-Matter Saucers appear randomly and move about the screen in a confusing fashion. These saucers can be destroyed only with Phasers. If the saucer collides with the Enterprise, it will attach itself, drain your ships Warp energy, then leave quickly.[-LF-]After a number of rounds, the player advances to the Nomad round. In this sequence Nomad zips about the screen depositing dangerous mines. The mines cause chain reactions which should be avoided. Nomad can only be destroyed with Phasers. Once Nomad has delivered its total load of 30 mines, it waits for the last mine to detonate, leaves the screen, and ends the round.[-LF-]Every 10,000 to 40,000 points (operator selectable) the player is awarded a bonus Shield unit, Photon Torpedo and Warp time unit. The two player game is played with players alternating with each complete round. Whenever a player is eliminated, the other player continues and finishes the game.</story>

The first scene is the Space Attack, with waves of hostile space-craft attacking your lonely but powerful ship. You battle to the Death Star, and once there fly close to the ground in a daring attempt to blast the space towers and flying stars, steering your way through the barrage. Finally, you emerge in the trench, jumping and ducking the stretch barriers and shooting the missile emplacements fastened to each side of the death-defying walls. There are many levels to the game with stirring music and speech synthesis - fast and furious action is guaranteed throughout!</story>

A lone mechanoid dragon, unhappy with the actions of his comrades, rebels and sets out to thwart their invasion of the Planet of the Golden Dragon.[-LF-]Saint Dragon is a demanding and playable sideways scrolling shoot-em-up, played over six different stages. The tail of the mechanoid dragon the player controls is impervious to enemy attacks and causes damage to any enemy it touches. The head of the dragon is effectively the &apos;ship&apos; of the game and a direct hit from an enemy will result in the loss of a life.[-LF-]At various points in a stage bronze-coloured eggs appear which, when shot, release weapon and speed power-ups.</story>

Players can decide which planets to attack, when to purchase additional firepower and when to attack the Apocalypse.[-LF-]Strikeforce&apos;s graphics differ from the minimalist, stylish appearance of the first two games in the series; with full colour sprites, multi-layer scrolling and colourful, visceral explosions giving the game its own distinctive look and feel.,</story>

    <story>Take a seat, grasp the controls, and enter the world of the S.T.U.N. (Spread Tunnel Underground Network) Runner. Players travel ahead in time to the 21st century and experience the thrill of racing in a futuristic form of competitive driving. At the control of state-of-the-art technology, players pilot a billion-dollar vehicle capable of attaining speeds of over 900 miles per hour![-LF-]Players control their vehicles with a return-to-center (RTC) flight controller. Control handles adjust shot elevation and include trigger buttons for firing. The start button is also used as a fire button for &apos;shock waves&apos;.[-LF-]S.T.U.N. runner is a game of speed. The goal of this game is to travel as fast as possible and complete each race within the allotted time. Numerous enemies prevent the player from achieving this goal. Equipped with powerful lasers, all enemies can be gunned down with the exception of one.[-LF-]The race through the S.T.U.N. Network is made up of many levels. Each level presents a unique challenge to the player. The player&apos;s ultimate goal is to guide the vehicle through the network of levels to reach the &apos;Ultimate Challenge&apos;. In this never-ending race, players go as far as their driving skills will take them. If the distance they travel qualifies as one of the top five, their name (18 letters) will be displayed along the road for future players to see (only if they reach this distance).[-LF-]In S.T.U.N. Runner, there is no foot pedal to control speed. Faster speed is achieved by -[-LF-] Correctly driving on the fastest portion of the tunnel.[-LF-] Staying off side rails (of flat sections).[-LF-] Avoiding collisions with enemy vehicles.[-LF-] Running over &apos;boosts&apos; for hyperspeed.[-LF-] Avoiding areas under construction.[-LF-]In turn, the fastest portion of the tunnel is the outer wall. Like a luge or bobsled racer, players use basic laws of physics to attain the fastest speed. Riding on the inner wall results in a slower speed and hinders a player&apos;s ability to reach a finish line. On flat sections, running into side rails creates a visual and audio chattering resulting in a loss of speed. The first race, a training race, called &apos;Cake Walk&apos;, is intended to teach players how to drive correctly.[-LF-]Red flashing markers in tunnels and flats are called &apos;boosts&apos;. By running over these, the S.T.U.N. Runner gets a boost of hyperspeed. In addition to reaching the finish line faster, a S.T.U.N. Runner in boost in invincible. The vehicle can pass through all enemy vehicles unharmed and cannot be shot. In this mode the player&apos;s vehicle will appear transparent as though it is a skeleton.[-LF-]The underground network has three different tunnel sections. They include wide tunnels, narrow tunnels, and tunnels under construction. Under construction sections contain portions that are unsurfaced. These areas do not provide full power to the vehicle, and slow down the S.T.U.N. Runner.[-LF-]Open areas are called &apos;flats&apos; and are both narrow and wide. Being above the ground, the player is treated to many views of the earth&apos;s surface in the 21st century. On flats, players must avoid driving along the side rails. The friction caused will slow down the S.T.U.N. Runner vehicle.[-LF-]A S.T.U.N. Runner vehicle has six shields for added protection. Colliding with an enemy results in the loss of one shield. At the end of each race, players are awarded bonus points for each shield remaining. A large bonus is awarded if all shields are intact.[-LF-]In the tunnels and flats are ramps. These ramps will catapult S.T.U.N. Runners above the track for a brief distance. Ramp jumping is often a good method of crossing areas under construction and avoiding collisions with enemies.[-LF-]When players do not reach the finish line of a race within the allotted time, the game would normally end. However, they can be allowed to advance to the next level on a continuation.[-LF-]Special Weapon - In selected races, a &apos;shock wave&apos; is located along the way. If the player can pick up the shock wave, the weapon becomes available for use. Also, shock waves can be awarded on some levels if the player hits a predetermined number of stars and completes the level. This information is green in the map at the start of each level.[-LF-]Players activate the shock wave by pressing the start button. This super weapon will destroy all enemies and hazards within view. It is a one-time weapon, but more than one can be stored. The number of shock waves stored is show as blue and white icons on the screen below the level number display.[-LF-]Bonus Stars - Additional points can be scored along the way by running over &apos;stars&apos;. In the first race, the training race called &apos;Cake Walk&apos;, the stars are red. Players should run over as many stars as possible. In the remainder of the game, all bonus stars are green.[-LF-]Challenge Races - These are bonus races awarded to players for reaching various points in the game. Races 5, 10, and 15 are challenge races. Each presents a unique challenge to the player.[-LF-] Boost Challenge[-LF-] Star Challenge[-LF-] Kill Challenge[-LF-]In each challenge race, players have one goal. Instructions are displayed prior to the start of each race. The time clock still operates, but a game will not end because the time expires. This is considered a free bonus for players. Each challenge level has its own high score table.[-LF-]Ultimate Challenge - For those players skillful and patient enough, an &apos;Ultimate Challenge&apos; awaits them at the end. It is an endless race filled with enemies and unexpected surprises. The object is to travel as far as possible within the allotted time. Markers on the road display the names of the five best S.T.U.N. Runners. It is a unique method of identifying the best players of the game. These names are also presented on a separate high score table.</story>

    <story>Super Tank is one of two original games manufactured by German company Video Games GmbH. Released in 1981, it was licensed to SNK for the Japanese market and Computran for the US Market.In Super Tank, up to two players simultaneously control highly mobile armored tanks on a mission to destroy the SUPER TANK. An introductory collection round challenges the players to clear a field of mines and destroy as many red enemy tanks as possible. Special glowing diamonds are scattered throughout, providing temporary super armor protection and making the players’ task easier.After clearing the field of mines, the players are ready for their confrontation with the SUPER TANK! The SUPER TANK is this game’s most dangerous adversary. It is a highly-maneuverable vehicle with a single weakness at the tip of its nozzle. A direct hit on the nozzle will destroy the SUPER TANK, bringing the players to another more intricate collection round where the challenges are greater and so are the rewards.Oddly enough, the German and Japanese versions of the game’s flyer depict a flower-laden, treaded vehicle with the head and body of a Roman gentleman, much like a centaur. This vehicle is shown shooting water at other similar vehicles out of his elongated nose. It is thought that restrictions against war games and cultural standards were responsible for these gentle depictions of the military-themed action in the game.</story>

Unlike its predecessor, however, Capcom vs. SNK 2, SvC features no air guards and lacks a &apos;groove system&apos;, instead focusing on quicker game play and online competition.[-LF-]Each character is equipped with a basic three-bar system for executing &apos;Exceeds&apos; (special attacks), with basic filling options attributed to strikes and damage. Additionally, the sprites from the various series received new models and some special effects were changed in the command lists (For example, the player can no longer increase the damage of the &apos;Zujou Sashi&apos; used by Choi Bounge by tapping the buttons).</story>

    <story>An abstract one or two player shoot-em-up in which the aim is to stop swarms of aliens from building a sectional tunnel from the bottom of the screen to the top.[-LF-]At the top of each level are blue tunnel sections, while at the bottom are purple ones. Aliens start at the bottom of the screen in the purple sections. As they move through a tunnel, they can build new sections in any direction.[-LF-]Players can either destroy blue tunnel sections, or &apos;shove&apos; them to re-align them and prevent the aliens from completing their mission. Purple sections cannot be destroyed but they CAN be shoved. A &apos;smart bomb&apos; can be deployed which will destroy all nearby enemies, as well as the players, on-screen counter-parts should they be within the blast radius when the bomb explodes. Additional bombs can be earned by destroying blue sections of tunnel.[-LF-]If the aliens succeed in connecting up a tunnel, additional enemies appear and the challenge increasing substantially. Each round ends when a preset number of &apos;Blocker&apos; aliens have been destroyed.[-LF-]There are four types of enemies -[-LF-] BLOCKERS - These foes build the tunnels and they can exit the tunnel system or be forced out. If they exit the tunnels, they produce &apos;Expelers&apos; (see below) and quickly make their way to the bottom of the screen to re-enter the tunnels. This is the only time that they are vulnerable.[-LF-] EXPELERS - These enemies, produced by the Blockers, chase the players around the screen and attempt to corner them. They travel at different speeds, generally moving faster as they get closer to SWAT agents.[-LF-] ANNGRERS - These cubed-shaped foes are invulnerable to the SWAT agent&apos;s fire. Shooting this type of enemy will cause it to chase the players very quickly. They can be destroyed by using bombs, but a new Anngrer will be created in its place at the bottom of the screen. These enemies can travel in and out of the tunnel system wherever they choose.[-LF-] SWEEPERS - Along with additional enemy fire, these foes appear in pairs on the left and right sides of the tunnel along if the bottom and top portions of the screen are connected by one continuous tunnel. They will line up with each other on either side of the players&apos; SWAT agents and fire at them. Sweepers require multiple shots to be destroyed.</story>

    <story>Tank Force is a multi-directional shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1991; it was the last game to run on their System 1 hardware (which had been in use for four years), is the sequel to Battle City, which was released six years earlier and is a sequel to Tank Battalion, which had been released five years before it (and eleven years before this title). The US version of the game was also the first of seven games from the company to display the Federal Bureau of Investigation&apos;s Winners Don&apos;t Use Drugs screen during its attract mode - the others are Steel Gunner 2, F/A, Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Knuckle Heads, Lucky &amp; Wild, and Numan Athletics. Exvania and Super World Court, which were Japan-exclusive, may also feature the screen in their attract mode if the Display FBI Screen setting in the games&apos; options menus has been set to Yes.</story>

    <story>Targ is a one or two player shooter game released by Exidy in 1980. Your town is invaded by Targ riders, you must manouvre the heroic vehicle Whummel to destroy them. From time to time, a Spectar comes into screen, and can be destroyed for extra bonus.Action takes place into a 9x9 grid, Crystal City, where the player&apos;s vehicle must avoid and chase down 10 enemy wedge-shaped vehicles. When all enemies are destroyed, you are awarded an extra bonus and can access the following level. Two players can alternate in the game. You use a 4 way joystick to control the Whummel, and a pushbutton to fire at enemies. Progressing in the gameplay causes the Targs to become faster and smarter, for a fast and furious gameplay.A small trivia on the game and characters name- apparently, Targ stands for Target, Spectar stands for Special Target.While in that period many western companies licensed games from japanese developers (Exidy itself licensed Nintendo&apos;s Sheriff as Bandido) targ is one of the few western games that made it in the opposite way, being licensed by Sega for japanese distribution.This game has a sequel, always released in 1980, Spectar.</story>

    <story>You control a Q bert-style character with a machine gun. The object of the game is to shoot all the hoppers (small non-moving characters) in room and then move onto the next. Each room has its own unique monster type that attacks you and the room is named accordingly. For instance, the first two are-The Face Room - Square face monsters that chase youThe Evil Eyeball Room - Eyeball monsters that bounce aroundThe Smart Bomb kills all the monsters currently on-screen and stops the walls that are slowly closing in from the left and the right. Every third screen is a bonus room containing two Smart Bombs and numbers that can be collected in ascending order to gain points. The walls in the bonus rooms close in much faster.Use an eight-direction machine to kill the hoppers. Hold the fire button down for rapid fire, but you will be unable to move while doing so. Bullets have a limited range and also bounce off of the walls. Running into hoppers or monsters will kill you. When all the hoppers are killed the top and bottom walls disappear and you must run out to proceed onto the next room.</story>

Distinct additions included attack reversals for some characters, back throws, chain-throws, and a sidestep unique to two characters, Kazuya Mishima and Heihachi Mishima; However, Yoshimitsu has a spinning sidestep move that lowers his health. Tackles were also modified to inflict damage when running from a greater distance.</story>

    <story>Terra Cresta is a vertically scrolling shoot &apos;em up. The player controls a ship, initially with limited firepower. Numbered pods appear containing further parts of the ship that will increase firepower. These additional parts combine with the player&apos;s ship to increase its firepower, and the final module transforms it into a fiery phoenix which is invulnerable for a certain period of time. Once the ship has multiple sections, the player may also split it, allowing it to fire in multiple directions.The player begins with three lives and it is possible to play with either one or two players.</story>

    <story>Tetris (In Russian- Тетрис) is a puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Alexey Pajitnov in the Soviet Union. It was released on June 6, 1984, while he was working for the Dorodnicyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Science of the USSR in Moscow, Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. He derived its name from the Greek numerical prefix tetra- (all of the game&apos;s pieces contain four segments) and tennis, Pajitnov&apos;s favorite sport.</story>

    <story>Thunder Fox is an arcade game created by Taito. It was released in arcades in 1990 and for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis in 1991. It was later released on various consoles such as the Xbox and PlayStation 2 in a compilation of Taito classics. The title of the compilation is Taito Legends.The gameplay for Thunder Fox is similar to other popular side scrolling action games like Namco&apos;s Rolling Thunder (video game), and Sega&apos;s Shinobi (arcade game). There are three buttons for each player - Attack, which normally is used to make Thunder and Fox (the game&apos;s heroes) stab with their knives. Jump, and a Weapon button which fires or throws a weapon acquired by the heroes. What makes this game unique is that the game gives players the opportunity to allow players to use their obtained weapons (save for the hand grenades) as melee weapons which helps conserve ammunition for when it&apos;s needed.</story>

    <story>The game is a vertical scrolling shooter where the player controls a helicopter taking on hordes of enemies which include tanks, battleships, and artillery. It is interesting to note that, besides some airplanes taking off, there are no flying enemies in the entire game. The player&apos;s main weapon is an unlimited supply of missiles which travel a max distance of half the screen&apos;s height. The player also has two bombs which destroy all objects within a large circular radius. These bombs can be blown off by enemy bullets. The player is killed after only one hit, and is re-spawned to a point approximately one whole vertical screen-length later, thus progressing the player past the obstacle that had killed him, albeit at a high cost. The player is given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 20000 points and every 80000 points thereafter. Flashing crosses scattered throughout each level award players power-ups depending on which color the cross is. A red cross will gives the player one side-firing mini-heli which shoots perpendicular to the player&apos;s helicopter. A white cross yields a forward firing mini-heli. It is possible to have a mix and match of side-helis, totaling no more than two. The green cross will award the player with an additional bomb, if the player currently has less than two. Grabbing power-ups when not necessary yields 5000 points.There are a total of four stages, all of which start and end with a helipad. After completion of the last stage, the game will restart in a more difficult mode starting on stage 2. Most of the game&apos;s areas contain unnecessary objects to destroy for bonus points, such as oil drums and houses. This was uncharacteristic for shoot &apos;em ups at the time.</story>

While the pedal is released the player is moved behind cover so that he can reload without being hit. The light gun that this arcade game used had a blowback function where the top of the gun would slide back to simulate a real gun.

    <story>Time Pilot is a multi-directional scrolling shooter and free-roaming aerial combat arcade game designed by Yoshiki Okamoto, released by Konami in 1982, and distributed in the United States by Centuri. Debuting in the golden age of video arcade games, it is a time travel themed game that allowed the player&apos;s plane to freely move across open air space that can scroll indefinitely in all directions.The Killer List of Videogames included Time Pilot in its list of top 100 arcade games of all time.The player assumes the role of a pilot of a futuristic fighter jet, trying to rescue fellow pilots trapped in different time eras. The player must fight off hordes of enemy craft and defeat the mother ship (or boss) present in every level. The background moves in the opposite direction to the player&apos;s plane, rather than the other way around; the player&apos;s plane always remains in the center.</story>

    <story>Yo! After being treated like garbage by the Ninja Turtles, Shredder has trained a new, more merciless breed of Foot Soldiers to inflict his revenge- A clan of over 700 Taekwondo turtle terminators who have once again captured April O&apos;Neil to use as turtle bait. Fortunately you don&apos;t have to face these freaks of torture alone. For the first time ever, two dudes or dudettes can join forces and double-team Shredder, kicking shell while covering each others tails. But to survive you&apos;ve gotta fight through 8 action-packed arcade levels, including Vinnie&apos;s Valet Stalking Lot and the Soho Sewer System, plus two new never-before-seen shell-squashing stages! Each of these deathtraps is reinforced by lethal electro zappers, laser beams, freezer burners or enemies such as Scorpion Robots, Stone Warriors and Baxter Stockman. Shredder has also hired the all-powerful Tora and Shogun, two alien bounty hunters who have never known defeat. Even though Master Splinter has prepared the turtles well for battle, teaching them radical new attack moves, it doesn&apos;t mean this war to save April and turtlekind will be a piece of cake or even a slice of pizza. Because with the forces of revenge on his side and the bounty boys in town, it&apos;s payback time for Shredder!</story>

    <story>The sequel to 1989&apos;s hugely successful original &apos;Turtles in Time&apos; once more sees the four heroes taking on Shredder and his army. Game-play remains similar to the original game, but the experience is enhanced further with the obligatory improved graphics and sound effects. &apos;Turtles in Time&apos; also features a larger variety of levels, as now the battle between good and evil rages across time as the Turtles travel to prehistoric, pirate and Wild West times in their pursuit of the elusive Splinter.[-LF-]Yet again, Konami&apos;s mastery of the genre was in evidence as the manic energy and humour of the cartoon and comic-book series upon which the game is based was captured perfectly.,</story>

    <story>Toki, known in Japan as JuJu Densetsu (JuJu伝説?) is a 1989 shoot &apos;em up platformer arcade game, or a run and gun developed and published in Japan by TAD Corporation and published in North America by Fabtek. It features elements of tongue-in-cheek humor combined with the action. The player takes control of an enchanted ape who must battle hordes of jungle monsters with energy balls from his mouth (described humorously as monkey-spit or monkey-vomit by some gamers). The ultimate goal is to destroy the evil wizard who cast a spell on you; therefore transforming yourself from an ape back into a human, and rescuing the kidnapped princess. The game was ported to several video game consoles and home computers.</story>

    <story>Toobin&apos; involves Biff and Jet racing their way down the rapids of a river, riding on tires. You rotate your tyre left or right, and drift as the current sends you, making sure to avoid the banks of the river, and the dividing lines in the middle. Hazards include crocodiles, stray logs and branches, and fishermen - you are armed with a limited supply of tin cans to take care of these. There are gates to slide through on the way down - these give you a points bonus. Each level has a strict time limit to adhere to, although there&apos;s a kickin&apos; party at the end if you succeed.</story>

    <story>The game is a very simple game of baseball implemented with stick figures. The game is very simple in terms of rules, and anybody can pick up on how to play fairly quickly. This is a two player only title, with both people playing for a single quarter. The pitching player selects his pitch with one joystick, while moving his outfielders with a second one. The batting player only has a single button (that is a &apos;swing&apos; button). Both players use the same set of controls, so they must switch spots in front of the machine midway through each inning. You get a four inning game for one quarter, although that number can be adjusted by the game operator.,</story>

    <story>A pseudo-sequel to Williams&apos; superb 1990 shoot-em-up, Smash TV, Total Carnage is set in a futuristic parody of the first Gulf War. General Ahkboob, himself an obvious parody of Sadam Hussein, has set his vast army of infantry, tanks and BioGenetic Mutants onto the world.[-LF-]1 or 2 players must fight through the enemy-packed levels, rescuing reporters and civilians as they go. Total Carnage retains the dual-joystick control of its predecessor, but introduced new weapons, enemies and large, scrolling levels to the original game-play.[-LF-]As with Smash TV, Total Carnage features the infamous &apos;Pleasuredome&apos;; accessible only if players manage to collect the 220 keys that are hidden throughout the game&apos;s levels. Total Carnage has a much higher difficulty level than that of Smash TV.</story>

    <story>Turbo Out Run is the first arcade-based sequel to the legendary 1986 original. It echews the forked-road, variable route gameplay of it&apos;s illustrious predecessor and instead opts for a set route point-to-point race across America. There are several new game-play additions, however, which help to differentiate &apos;Turbo Out Run&apos; from the original.[-LF-]Firstly, there&apos;s the &apos;Turbo&apos; of the game&apos;s title; a turbo boost that greatly increases the car&apos;s speed when engaged. It must be used sparingly, however, as overuse will cause the engine to overheat, rendering the turbo useless until such time as the engine has cooled (as indicated by an on-screen &apos;Overheat&apos; meter).[-LF-]Weather conditions are another new feature, with both snow and rain having an adverse effect on driving conditions and car handling. Road surfaces also vary greatly in quality, with sand, oil, speed bumps, safety barriers, standing water and other debris all adding to the challenge.[-LF-]The final new addition is the ability to upgrade the player&apos;s car. This is possible upon completion of every four of the game&apos;s sixteen stages. Available power-ups are an improved turbo boost, a more powerful engine, or better gripping tires.[-LF-]Turbo Out-Run&apos;s sixteen stages are as follows-[-LF-] Stage 1- New York[-LF-] Stage 2- Washington D.C.[-LF-] Stage 3- Pittsburgh[-LF-] Stage 4- Indianapolis (1st car upgrade section)[-LF-] Stage 5- Chicago[-LF-] Stage 6- St. Louis[-LF-] Stage 7- Memphis[-LF-] Stage 8- Atlanta (2nd car upgrade section)[-LF-] Stage 9- Miami[-LF-] Stage 10- New Orleans[-LF-] Stage 11- San Antonio[-LF-] Stage 12- Dallas (3rd car upgrade section)[-LF-] Stage 13- Oklahoma City[-LF-] Stage 14- Denver[-LF-] Stage 15- Grand Canyon (Runs along Route 66)[-LF-] Stage 16- Los Angeles (End of game)</story>

The simple gameplay, based on quick repeating button presses, set the basics for sequels and similar games in the genre for the next decades. There were several home versions of the original; the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions were only released as part of the Game, Set and Match II compilation in 1988, and are poorly regarded by fans.</story>

    <story>An abstract take on the 3d racing genre, Tropical Angel puts the player in control of a female water-skier who must dodge the many rocks that protrude from the water while attempting to steer through a set number of gates - in the form of a pair of flags - before the time limit expires. The acceleration button needs to be held down all the time while the &apos;trick&apos; button makes the water-skiing girl spin through one-eighty degrees and proceed to ski backwards. The player cannot steer while traveling backwards, but will earn bonus points for the duration of the trick. As the game progresses, small ramps, buoys and sharks come into play. The small ramps can be jumped to add to the player&apos;s score, although they&apos;re always in difficult to reach locations. The buoys are usually very close together, but skiing between them earns bonus points. Finally, the shark will appear from time-to-time, running into it means game over, regardless of how much time the player has left.</story>

    <story>1 to 4 players take on the role of a cute dinosaur, selected from the four on offer - Rex (red), Bloop (blue), Spike (yellow) and Gwen (lavender). The game takes place in a prehistoric land called &apos;Og&apos; and is made up of forty-nine different islands; the dinos must collect all of the dinosaur eggs that lay on the islands, while avoiding the unwanted attention of a tribe of one-eyed cavemen, called &apos;Trogs&apos;. The dinos can punch the attacking Trogs; one punch will only stun a Trog but several punches will knock the enemy off the screen. There are 4 different Trogs who pursue the dinos -[-LF-] Brown Trogs who use only their fists.[-LF-] Red Trogs who use clubs and create fires or holes in the ground.[-LF-] Blue Trogs who pop up out of the ground and roll stone wheels.[-LF-] Green Trogs who bounce around trying to crush you with their springs.[-LF-]On each island, after the dinos have gathered up all of their eggs, they must make their way to the base labeled &apos;Home&apos;; from here they will move on to the next island.[-LF-]Between each stage, there is an intermission where the players&apos; Dinos will dance, with an on-screen caption proudly declaring &apos;Excellent!&apos;, &apos;Congratulations!&apos;, &apos;Nice Work!&apos;, &apos;Good Job!&apos; or &apos;Dino-Mite!&apos;. On occasion, an intermission screen appears that shows a Trog planning another attempt to eat a Dino.</story>

    <story>The year is 1989, one year after the great gobble blight which plagued the world. One-third of the earth&apos;s populace was transformed by the ailment. The side effect of the turkey transformation is a tendency toward violence and comradery between these turkeys to organize for rabble-rousing in the urban areas. In February of &apos;89, a group of specially trained agents (the turkey terminators) was formed for the sole task of destroying the turkey menace...[-LF-]And so it begins. As a Turkey Terminator, the player is given 100 missions and 3 weapons to eliminate all the turkeys, leaving no &apos;left-overs&apos;. He can take aim with his lethal laser gun using the position dot on the screen Screen-shot to hone in on his enemies with deadly accuracy. He can launch a lit grenade to annihilate all the turkeys within range or he can activate his gobble button (available one time each mission) to freeze all the turkeys for an instant, making them &apos;sitting ducks&apos;. Missions are varied and include reacting quickly to clever ploys such as turkey air raids, turkeys disguising themselves as businessmen and turkey helicopter get-aways. Every 8th round is a rapid-fire bonus wave where the player has 15 seconds to eliminate as many criminals as possible. Shooting fire hydrants and trash cans as well as freeing bystanders who have been taken hostage also score bonus points.[-LF-]Three &apos;fowl-ups&apos; are allowed and occur whenever any turkey... a Pilot Turkey, Boss Turkey, Cyborg Turkey or Thug Turkey... escapes or when an innocent bystander... a businessman, shopper or policeman... is damaged.</story>

    <story>Turtles is your standard maze game (one of dozens released in the wake of Pac-Man), with a few twists. The game begins by showing your turtle entering a building (a very early &apos;cut scene&apos;), you are then presented with the first maze. Each maze has several boxes (with question marks on them), scattered around. You most open these boxes one at a time by walking on to them. Each box contains either an enemy bug (who will pursue you), or a &apos;KidTurtle&apos;. The &apos;KidTurtles&apos; are what you are looking for here. When you find one it will climb onto your back, and take it back to the turtle house which will be located in one of the corners. After you rescue a few turtles the game becomes more difficult because of the amount of baddies that you will have released, but luckily a star will appear in the center of the screen to help you out. Grab this star to gain land mines. You can drop these in the path of a baddie, and cause him to freeze temporarily (you can safely walk over frozen baddies). A new game screen starts after you rescue all the &apos;KidTurtles&apos;. After 8 levels you get to watch a small ending sequence, and then the game starts over with increased difficulty.</story>

    <story>Twin Hawk resembles other shooters of the time, specifically Toaplan&apos;s earlier game, Flying Shark. Also like Toaplan&apos;s other games, there were various differences between the Japanese version and other versions, including a checkpoint system and higher difficulty for the former. Unusually, the game contains no flying enemies; thus, a complete lack of physical obstructions and a stronger focus on the numbers and speed of ground forces.</story>

    <story>Two Tigers is a 2-Dimensional shooter. The game starts by telling you how may hits you must make on the ship before you can claim credit for sinking it. You then will go to the next screen which has your fighter/bomber in the middle of the screen. A gunsight will also be somewhere in the sky (the gunsight is actually the spot where anti-aircraft fire will be hitting at). Soon the sky is filled with enemy planes and a ship enters the screen from the left side. You mission will be to do whatever it takes to put the required number of holes into the enemy ship to sink it. You have at your disposal a single bomb and the enemy planes themselves for achieving your goal. Along the way, other things may assist (if you shoot them) such as mines and fuel drums. The game will go until you fail to sink 2 ships. If you are in 2-player cooperative mode, then the number of holes to sink a ship will be increased. The same rules apply, though, for sending it to the bottom of the sea.</story>

And now there&apos;s only three ways he can get out- 1. He can serve his three year term, 2. He can buy his way out by earning $1,000,000 from destroying enemies, or 3. He can desert, which is considered a federal crime in Asran. In the fight against Project 4, Shin is joined by two pilots, Mickey Simon and Greg Gates.The player can choose between three mercenary pilots- Shin Kazama, Mickey Simon, and Greg Gates. Each pilot flies a specific plane and has slightly different capabilities.Shin Kazama- Shin flies an F-20 Tigershark; the weapons on his plane fire forward only but at a quick pace. Shin and his plane are the most balanced combination available.Mickey Simon- Mickey flies an F-14 Tomcat; the weapons on his plane also fire forward only, but are also larger (albeit slower), inflicting more damage than Shins plane.Greg Gates- Greg flies an A-10 Thunderbolt; this plane has smaller forward fire than either Shin or Mickey&apos;s planes, but it also fires a second stream downward at a 45° angle from the forward firing stream.</story>

    <story>Uo Poko is a puzzle game for one or two players (co-operative). The aim is to clear the screen of coloured glass balls by dropping like-coloured balls down onto them. Connecting three or more like-coloured balls creates a chain reaction and causes them to disappear.[-LF-]Balls are launched into the play area via a joystick controlled &apos;pinball-plunger&apos; and as in Pinball, the further the plunger is pulled back, the further the coloured ball will travel. Mastering the strength and distance required is essential in order to drop each ball accurately onto its target. To allow players to learn how to use the plunger, the first two stages feature a guide line which shows exactly where a ball will drop. From the third stage onwards, players must use their judgement alone.[-LF-]Bonus points are awarded if a stage is completed quickly enough. If too much time is taken, however, the bottom of the stage will start to rise, pushing the balls already in play towards the top of the screen. If the top of the screen is reached, the game is over.[-LF-]Uo Poko features thirty stages of play.</story>

The flags needed are displayed at the top of the screen and are coloured as follows- Light green, blue, red, olive, dark green, magenta, yellow and black. If the flags are collected quickly enough, bonus points are awarded. Collected flags remain visable on the track but are changed to white in colour.[-LF-]In addition to the enemy vehicles, other hazards to be negotiated include potholes, broken bridges, steep hills and sharp corners. The player&apos;s veicle can jump over both obstacles and vehicles, and if players land their vehicle on an enemy vehicle, the enemy is destroyed. Jumping at the wrong time, however, can send the player&apos;s vehicle into the path of an enemy, or off the track completely, resulting in the loss of a life. Players can also control the speed of their vehicle and even move in reverse.[-LF-]Each round is progessively more difficult than the last, with more obstacles and enemy vehicles littering the courses.</story>

    <story>Varth follows the story of a disaster that befalls a human colony on a planet of the same name. The entire colony is run by a 7th generation supercomputer which controls the operations of all machinery on the planet. Unfortunately for the residents of Varth, Delta-7 has been possessed by the entity DUO (Dimension Unbody Offender), thought of as an evil spirit but actually a temporal-spatial consciousness which spontaneously arose within the supercomputer. DUO has come to the conclusion that human existence is inimical to the planet, and has therefore turned the planet&apos;s defenses against its own populace. Eighty percent of the planet is laid waste by the event, and this is only the beginning of DUO&apos;s cleansing scheme. The colonists&apos; reliance on the supercomputer has caused them to lose the ability to take care of themselves, and thus have no means of fighting back. The only hope for the colony lies in the pilots of two planes equipped with 4th generation computers which DUO cannot control—they are controlled not by machinery, but by humans.</story>

    <story>Venture is a 1- or 2-player Gauntlet style game (although Venture pre-dates the Atari legend by 4 years) set in a multi-level dungeon. The player, armed with a bow and arrow fights through enemy infested levels in the quest to collect treasure.[-LF-]Each dungeon is represented as a floor plan, populated with a number of Space Invader like monsters. Numerous rooms and their corresponding doors are clearly marked; these rooms are the treasure rooms and each one must be cleared. When the player enters a room, the viewpoint zooms in on the action and the room takes up the whole screen. Each room has a treasure or weapon guarded by one or more creatures. Players must try to retrieve the treasure while avoiding (or killing) creatures and obstacles. Only in the rooms themselves can players use their bow and arrow.[-LF-]When the treasure is successfully taken out of the chamber, bonus points are awarded. The screen image then returns to the original, zoomed-out floor plan and the player moves on to the next room of their choice. Once a room has been cleared of its item, the player no longer has access to that room. The player must collect all of the treasures on the current level before descending to another dungeon.</story>

    <story>Victory is a game which you control your Battlestar to destroy an alien force which has overrun your planet. This force has installed radar and quark silos on your planet and use their deadly armada to drop paratroopers to the surface to release the quarks. All is not lost however as your Battlestar is equipped capable lasers and shields as well as the “Doomsday Device”. This game was released by Exidy in 1982 and programmed by Vic Tolomei. Your controls are a spinner and 4 lighted buttons (Thrust, Fire, Shield and Doomsday).The hardware for this game is impressive for its time, containing multiple processors and speech/audio chips which add very much to the game experience. Later, there was an upgrade kit that was sold to convert Victory games to a game called “Victor Banana”, changing the in-game graphics to match a more comical theme.</story>

The most powerful weapon in your arsenal is the SR-88 Battle Tank, but their fuel supply is very volitile. You must constantly replenish its fuel by picking up fuel canisters throughout the stations&apos; many levels.[-LF-]Battle stars can be found along the way. These are vital to enhancing your tank and adding weapons. Process generators can convert the battle stars into powers and weapons while in transit between levels and stations. Only with these customized tanks can the evil Tangent Empire be conquered.[-LF-]As you defeat each station, demolish its control room and take the supplies the fleeing Tangents have left behind.

    <story>The game takes place during the early 1950s in the United States, where an underground tournament known as the Violence Fight had become very popular among the criminal underworld and the public at large; criminals, especially mobsters, along with other public nuisances and upstanding citizens are allured by its stakes and thrill. The contestants, drawn from all across the country, compete for large sums of money and the title of No. 1 Quarreler. As the game begins, the tournament even attracts a young fighter named Bad Blue (or Bat Blue) from Los Angeles who competes for the title of No. 1 Quarreler and aspires to share a small fortune with his manager, Blinks.</story>

    <story>It is the 1990s. In the beginning, World War III has at last expired. The people are left to pick up the pieces and rebuild their civilizations. However, vicious gangs that prey on these defenseless citizens are obstructing the reconstruction.The main protagonists are Boris, Wade and Kyle, vigilantes who protect the feared and helpless. Their largest problem is the corrupt, incorrigible, ruthless and lethal gang known as The Geld Gang. They have commissioned every type of person imaginable. Purple-haired, leather-clad, chain-wielding, lead-pipe swinging, masked, martial art, orange-mohawked and men so strong and immune to pain they use manhole covers as shields.One day, when the trio is patrolling the streets, alert, ready and able to help those in need, they see a woman named Sheena (a friend of theirs) waving at them walking across the street out of a supermarket with groceries. A moment later, Lord Geld&apos;s right hand man, Red Freddy, snatches her away while riding on his purple hog. Now, the three braves must save Sheena from the grips of Lord Geld.</story>

Vulcan Venture strictly adheres to the shoot-em-up template set out by its hugely successful predecessor the game eschews the sideways/vertical scrolling alternate levels of Salamander and opts instead for Gradius sideways scrolling-only mechanic.

The player must then shoot the monster&apos;s twin before the first one recovers in order to eliminate the pair.On later boards, shooting a different monster results in the two becoming a mutant—the head of one joins with the torso of the other, and vice versa. To eliminate these mutants one must either unmix them, by shooting the same pair again, or produce a second identical mutant which can then be paired up with the first. Eliminating a pair of mutants is worth more points than eliminating a pair of non-mutants.As the player advances from board to board, the following additional transformations appear, introduced one at a time-Matched pairs of large monsters become tiny and fly around the screenTiny monsters turn into eggs and run aroundEggs turn into batsEach new form requires only one shot to be either destroyed or changed into the next one. All monsters on the screen must be turned into the next form before any of them can be destroyed or further transformed.</story>

You follow the wizard, and he kidnaps the girl, commenting that she will make a nice gift for Mr. Wardner. We can&apos;t have that, can we?On your quest to save your friend, you have to travel across 5 levels, to reach the evil Mr. Wardner. You will have to destroy monsters, jump over and duck under various traps, and collect gold and orbs to help you with your journey.You have a weapon meter on the bottom of the screen, which shows your current weapon, and weapon power (1 to 8). All weapons use the same power, so if you change weapons, you won&apos;t lose the power. The power, rather than making your weapon stronger, lets you fire it faster.</story>

    <story>In this timed abstract racing game, a single player controls a water-skier who is being pulled along behind a power-boat. The objective is to complete the course in as fast a time as possible to reach the next course, while avoiding rocks, sharks, motor boats, wind surfers and numerous other obstacles.[-LF-]The player can move their skier left or right, and can press buttons to either slow the boat&apos;s speed or to jump over obstacles. Small rocks are the most common obstacle and can either be avoided or jumped over. As well as the small rocks that litter each course, there are also ocassional large rocks; these cannot be jumped and must be avoided at all costs. Also, players must be watchful of the direction their tow-boat takes them otherwise they risk being dragged into oncoming obstacles or having their tow-rope snapped on one of the large rocks.[-LF-]As well as obstacles, each stage also contains one or more large jump ramps. To make a successful jump, players must ensure they hit the bottom of the ramp with their ski-board facing directly forwards. At the top of the ramp players must press the JUMP button, which will propel them from the end of the ramp to make a perfect landing in the water below. Making a successful ramp jump awards the player with bonus points, but if a player fails to hit the bottom of the ramp properly, they will crash and lose valuable seconds.</story>

    <story>As opposed to the more realistic hockey gameplay seen in Electronic Arts&apos; NHL series, the game featured a more unrealistic arcade-style of gameplay, featuring moves such as power saves, which caused the goaltender to briefly transform into a brick wall, power shots, which would set the net on fire or knock the goalie into the net, and power checks, which would send an ambulance across the top of the screen. It featured high-scoring games and over-the-top fights. There was also a simulation mode for those looking for more realistic gameplay. The game allowed the creation of profiles and would keep track of important individual and team stats, including goals, assists, and wins, among others.</story>

Upon the player&apos;s command, the player may switch his mount into a tiger and attack with his mace. Within each stage, there are also power-ups that allow the player to morph into a laser breathing dragon for a limited period of time.The player&apos;s life bar is represented by a fire breathing dragon in the upper corner. With each hit the player takes, the fire breath grows smaller. Once the life bar is depleted the player&apos;s mount is killed and the player travels on foot and fights with throwing daggers. If hit in this form then the player loses a life. The game is over when all of a players lives are lost.</story>

    <story>Pro Tennis- World Court (プロテニスワールドコート Puro Tenisu- Wārudo Kōto?) is a tennis sports arcade game that was released by Namco in 1988 only in Japan;[1] it runs upon Namco System 1 hardware, and was inspired by the 1987 Famicom game Family Tennis. In August 1988, the game was ported to the PC Engine console, [2] in which a new tennis-based role-playing quest mode was added,[3] and was later ported to the North American TurboGrafx-16 console by NEC under the title of World Court Tennis in 1989[2] - and a sequel named Super World Court was released in 1992, which ran on Namco NA-1 hardware and allowed up to four players to play simultaneously.Gameplay[edit]At the start of the game the players must select either singles (Player 1 v Player 2) or doubles (Player Team v CPU Team); they must then select one of twenty different players (ten male, eight female and two robot) before selecting one of three different courts (New York hard, London lawn, and Paris clay). They must then select whether they want the match to be one or three sets long - and, once they have done so, their two (or four) chosen players will come out, and take their positions on the court. The players must use an eight-way joystick to direct their chosen players around their half of the court and two buttons to hit the ball with their rackets; but just like in a real tennis match, faults, net balls and deuce can occur (but the Deuce setting in the options menu can be turned off).</story>

    <story>Warriors of Fate is a beat&apos;em up with nine stages. Each contains large mobs including spearman, archers, strongmen, bomb-wielding opponents, and at least one boss. Using two buttons, Attack and Jump, the characters all have standard moves typical of Capcom side-scrollers of the day.There is also a variety of weapons in the game which can be picked up. As with most side-scrollers, food is used to replenish health and can be found in various breakable containers in the game level. One notable feature of the game is the ability to summon a warhorse which adds more attacks to the characters, generally involving pole-arms. Most characters are given a special wrestling throw of their own, like in Final Fight and The Punisher.In the Japanese version, the game follows Liu Bei&apos;s plight in Jingzhou from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a history-based novel from China, set in the Three Kingdoms period as Cao Cao sets to invade his lands. In the English adaptation, however, the Three Kingdoms theme was lost, and most names have been changed to names of Mongolian origin.</story>

    <story>Wizard of Wor is an action game for one or two players. The game takes the form of several maze-like dungeons infested with monsters. The players&apos; characters, called Worriors, must kill all the monsters by shooting them. Player one has yellow Worriors, on the right, and player two has blue Worriors, on the left. In a two-player game, the players are also able to shoot each other&apos;s Worriors, earning bonus points and causing the other player to lose a life. Team-oriented players can successfully advance through the game by standing back-to-back (such as in a corner) and firing at anything that comes at them.Each dungeon consists of a single-screen rectangular grid with walls and corridors in various formations. The Worriors and the monsters can travel freely through the corridors. Each dungeon has doors at the left and right edges, which connect with each other, making the dungeon wrap around. Whenever a door is traversed by a player or monster, both of them deactivate for a short period, making them impassable. A player who exits the door can pop back through the door immediately when the Worluk or Wizard is in the dungeon. A small radar display indicates the positions of all active monsters.</story>

The original Japanese game cover featured a Hulk Hogan look-alike, with a bandana that spelled Hogan. It was changed for the European and US releases for royalties reasons. It did not change the wrestlers faces though, which still are similar to those of real wrestling stars of the time.Wrestle War has also been released as part of the Sega Smash PackThe player takes control of Bruce Blade, a rookie wrestler, through a series of matches to win the Sega Wrestling Alliance championship belt by facing the following wrestlers, each possessing their unique wrestling moves-Mohawk KidSledge Hammer (based on Bruiser Brody)Mr. J (based on Jason the Terrible)Don Dambuster (based on Road Warrior Hawk)Nim Rod Falcon (based on Mil Mascaras)Titan Morgan (based on Hulk Hogan)Buckskin Rogers (based on Stan Hansen)Grand Kong (based on Abdullah the Butcher)</story>

    <story>Xenophobe is a 1987 arcade game developed and published by Bally Midway.[1] Starbases, moons, ships, and space cities are infested with aliens, and the players have to kill the aliens before each is completely overrun. Xenophobe can be played by up to three players, and the goal of each level is to defeat all the aliens before time runs out. Some rooms routinely display the percentage of alien infection and time remaining until self-destruct when the level ends (but a nearby button can temporarily deactivate the count-down). Levels may contain more than one floor, and players use elevators (and sometimes holes in the floor) to move between floors to defeat all of the aliens. Players can also pick up more powerful weapons and other items to help in their eradication of the aliens.</story>

    <story>It&apos;s a nightmare, but it&apos;s true! Research shows that we are the actual aliens on Earth, and the ruthless Xevions are the original inhabitants.Now the Xevions want Earth back -- minus humans! Their invasion forces are fierce -- the land is crawling with deadly Domogram Rovers; the sky is black with Toroid Patrol Fleets and Zoshi Death Squads.Our puny weapons offer no defense. Earth&apos;s only hope is our powerful new Solvalou Fighter Plane. Its pilot will have a single mission- Penetrate the enemy ranks and destroy the Xevious Mother Ship.The mission is dangerous. We can&apos;t guarantee success. But at this point, it&apos;s do or die!One small problem. We still need a pilot. Any volunteers?</story>

Oolong must fight all the martial arts masters given by the game (11 in the arcade version; five to 13 in the home ports) unarmed to win the title of Grand Master and honor the memory of his father. On his side is a variety of punch and kick blows reachable by combining the joystick with one of the buttons (punch or kick). He also has the greatest jumping ability of all the game&apos;s fighters, with the exception of Blues.The player faces a variety of opponents, each with a unique appearance and fighting style.[2][3] The player can perform up to 16 different moves,[4] using a combination of buttons and joystick movements while standing, crouching or jumping.[5] Moves are thrown at high, middle, and low levels. Regardless of the move that defeated them, male characters (save Feedle) always fall unconscious lying on their backs with their legs apart (players flail their feet), and female characters always fall demurely lying on their sides. Feedle disappears. There are only two female fighters, and the rest are male. When a player gains an extra life, the word xiè xiè (Mandarin Chinese for thank you) is heard.</story>

    <story>In this title you play a little farmer guy, who is attempting to shoot down the crows out of his tree. Gameplay is identical to that of Space Invaders. A large bird replaces the UFO that goes over the top of the screen from time to time. While a lumberjack will chop out a section of the tree every time the birds reach the side of the screen (lowering them closer to the bottom). The only real gameplay difference is that the birds come in a pyramid pattern, as opposed to the rectangle pattern of Space Invaders. This serves to make the game much easier.</story>

The game gives the player the experience of flying a fighter craft through a fortress while shooting at enemy entities (missiles, enemy gunfire, etc.) The object of the game is to hit as many targets as possible without being shot down or running out of fuel—which can be replenished, paradoxically, by blowing up fuel drums.</story>

In order to liberate a city, you must defeat 3 attack waves of fighters and robo-probes. Fighters and Robo-probes are often shielded (in red), and each consecutive hit reduces the enemies shield strength, until, when the shield drops, a hit will destroy it. In addition, you will encounter three types of Moboids -[-LF-] Green Moboids spin the players ship on contact, and bounce enemy ships.[-LF-] Blue Moboids bounce all ships.[-LF-] Red Moboids destroy all un-shielded ships (including the players ship).[-LF-]After defeating three attack waves, the Alien Robot holding that city will reappear within rotating protective rings, through which a &apos;slot shot&apos; neutralizes that Robot, awarding the player a bonus ship and advancement to the next round.</story>

    <story>Zombie Raid is a screen scrolling Light gun shooter, Horror-themed game released for the arcade by American Sammy in January 1995.In 1918 England, a small village suffers a rash of kidnappings and grave-robbing incidents, and heavily armed zombies have begun to emerge. With the job too dangerous for the police to handle, private detective Edward Windsor begins to investigate. Following a shootout in the village cemetery, Edward rescues a man named Charles, and the two join forces to infiltrate a nearby castle where the zombies have originated. They become separated upon entering the castle, with Edward falling into a subterranean dungeon and having to fight his way out. Shortly after Edward and Charles reunite, Charles is fatally shot; however, an infection he has acquired mutates him into a hideous monster and Edward is forced to fight him in order to continue. Edward moves through the castle laboratory only to find Charles - mutated into a new form - waiting to battle him again at the exit.</story>

    <story>ZnY is basically Parodius meets Space Invaders (a premise also done by Taito themselves with Space Invaders &apos;95- Attack of the Lunar Loonies), except you control a statue instead of a spaceship and you fight within an enclosed arena instead of vertical space. It would be more akin to an arena shooter like Robotron- 2084, except your statue can only shoot straight upward. The stages themselves all seem to be themed around different parts of the world- The kabuki boss on the far-left represents Japan, the chef represents China and mainland Asia, the crusader knight stands for Europe, and the superhero on the far-right stands for America. Yet even outside of the Japanese stages, there&apos;s a distinctly goofy flair about the game that emphasizes screwy cultural stereotypes from a Japanese game company. The game&apos;s actual developer, Minato Giken, also helped work on the Game Gear version of Dynamite Headdy, one of the most fantastically insane Genesis platformers ever, and that same sort of unhinged design can also be seen in ZnY. You fight talk show hosts, salarymen, pandas, matadors, clowns, rock stars, and other outlandish opponents detailed in exaggeratedly comical fashions. The graphic design is definitely ZnY&apos;s strong suit, with its colorful characters and quite detailed playfields making high use of Sega&apos;s System C-2 hardware, the same processor behind Puyo Puyo.</story>

    <story>The object of the game is to guide the hero, named Zzyzzyxx, through a moving maze of bricks to collect gifts and bring them to the fair-haired Lola, the object of his affection. Zzzyzzyxx is opposed by the evil Rattifers, named Boris, Bluto and Smoot, who will try to intercept him as he makes his way through the maze. Zzyzzyxx can collect a helmet in the maze, which can be used to imprison a Rattifer inside a brick, or to break a brick in the row above to move through the maze. As the levels progress, Zzyzzyxx must avoid crumbling bricks, rising missiles, and dropping bombs. The game has a 1up player score and laps tallied at the top of the screen.</story>
