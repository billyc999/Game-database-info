    <story>Willy Beamish is a kid who likes to goof off and have fun. Naturally all the grown-ups get in the way by making him go to school, making him clean his room, etc. But now that&apos;s school&apos;s out for the summer, Willy is determined to have a good time and maybe even have his pet frog win the frog jumping contest. However Willy has a habit of getting into trouble, and naturally that means it will be a challenge to get out of it. The Adventures of Willy Beamish is a point-and-click graphical adventure. You play Willy Beamish, an eight year-old kid who is just trying to get through life without losing his lunch money. But he&apos;ll have to deal with parents, teachers, babysitters and bratty sisters. The player must solve different puzzles to ensure Willy can progress, get out of trouble and generally avoid ending up grounded. The in-game time progresses even if no action is taken. This means many puzzles have to be solved in a certain time frame or rely on being in the right place at the right time. A special aspect of this game is a bar which shows Willy&apos;s relationship to his parents. It gets affected by the way certain situations are resolved, e.g. it increases if Willy refuses to play with his sister, and when it is full they send Willy to a military school and the game is lost.</story>

As such, the game features the ability to play both in the cockpit as well as in the classic third person perspective. Both night and day scenarios are now available, with mission objectives that include new air-ground strikes. Includes 3 gameplay modes- Arcade, Timed and Hits which measures how many enemies you can shoot down in specific waves. No multiplayer support available.</story>

    <story>The Kingpin is at it again, and Spider-Man has just 24 hours to find the keys to defuse a bomb primed to wipe out New York City. Worse, the Kingpin has convinced the citizens that Spider-Man is the bomb&apos;s mastermind, and they&apos;re now out for his radioactive spider blood. To clear Spider-Man&apos;s name, the player must guide him through multiple levels and familiar super-villains in search of the bomb&apos;s keys - all while the 24-hour time limit mercilessly counts down. At Spidey&apos;s disposal are a range of hand-to-hand combat moves, plus web tricks including stunning web shots, web swings, and a web shield. Players can even form combos of web strikes and Spidey fists. And in a fairly uncommon platform maneuver, Spidey can stick to and crawl along any surface; including up walls and across ceilings. The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin for the Sega CD takes the idea and basic gameplay from the Genesis version, but makes some significant changes. There are new levels, new bosses, and an expanded set of combat moves. The player now has the freedom to select the next level or boss to tackle from a map screen. Graphics have also been redrawn and expanded from the Genesis release. However, the player can no longer rest and heal at Peter Parker&apos;s apartment, or take photographs of enemies for cash; both prominent features of the Genesis version. Animated cutscenes with voices are new to this version, as well as a new CD soundtrack. The player can also find and collect digital versions of classic Spider-Man comics, making further use of the multimedia storage space. A password system has also been added to save the player&apos;s progress.</story>

There is still hope, however- enemies of the Gurzons from the planet Prism offer their help. If just a few EDF pilots can make it to Prism, they will be provided with the ultimate weapon which may turn the tide- the A/X 101 system. Controlling one of four starfighters launched on the mission, it is the player&apos;s job to break the orbital blockade, make it to Prism and then take the fight to the enemy. The game is an on-rails shooter, with gameplay seen from a first-person cockpit perspective. The player&apos;s ship moves automatically through pre-rendered space and planetary environments and only the targeting crosshair can be moved freely. Laser Cannons and Fusion Warheads are available to hit the numerous enemies. Lasers have unlimited ammunition but need a few moments time to recharge. The warheads function as smart bombs and clear the screen of enemies, but are available only in limited supply. They are restocked when reaching a certain score. The ship&apos;s energy shield functions as a life bar. Between the shooting levels, there are transitional cutscenes, pre-rendered in the same way as the actual gameplay.</story>

    <story>Batman Returns on the SEGA CD is an enhanced version of the Genesis adaptation of the movie. It includes the entirety of the original platform game, but adds all-new driving levels. The game can be played in three ways- either as only the platform game, only the racing game, or a combination of both. Each option features a unique ending sequence. For every of the original version&apos;s five platform levels, there is a related driving section in which the player controls either the Batmobile or the Batskiboat. Both in perspective and gameplay, these sections are reminiscent of arcade titles like OutRun. Seen from above and behind, the player&apos;s vehicle must reach checkpoints before a timer runs out, receiving bonus points for any surplus seconds. The CD system&apos;s hardware is used for sprite scaling and other tricks, achieving a 3D effect. The game being based on an action-filled movie, there&apos;s not only driving but also shooting- both the car and the boat are armed with machine guns and heat-seeking missiles (with limited ammunition). Besides the roads being full of enemies in general, each level also ends in a boss fight against a big (and usually heavily armed) vehicle. The game features CD-based audio tracks, replacing those from the original.</story>

There are a wide variety of furry creatures to take on, and finally the Dalai Llama himself. Brutal- Paws of Fury is a standard one-on-one beat &apos;em up across a variety of levels, with mostly outdoor terrain. You can choose of the many characters. Throughout the game, your character travels across Dalai Llama&apos;s island, fighting a series of duels before getting to the final showdown. During a duel, you can punch and kick your opponent, try to use special attacks on him/her, or use a taunt that restores a bit of your health. Each battle lasts a number of rounds (how many - that is determined in the options menu); once one combatant has won that number of times during the battle, he wins. If the computer-controlled player won, it&apos;s game over (but you can still use a continue to start the fight anew); if you won, you move on to the next opponent. Once you have defeated them, you can watch an ending animation, different depending on the character you have chosen. Instead of beginning a whole new game, you can fight a single duel, choosing the opponent and terrain. You can choose to fight either a computer-controlled opponent or another human player. The visuals are leant towards cutesiness, which makes a change from the gore of Mortal Kombat and the metal of Rise of the Robots. In the console versions, you start the game without special moves, but get a new one after each successful best-of-three bout. The computer versions drop this feature, though.</story>

You find yourself in the so-called Xenozoic Age - after a cataclysm in 2020 A.D., mankind was forced to hide beneath the surface. Once it could come out again, it found the world terribly changed, with dinosaurs roaming freely once again. A mysterious mutant-like race, called the Grith, believe the cataclysm was caused by the upsetting of the natural balance. Now, the leader of the restored City in the Sea, Scharnhorst, is using old technology and disrupting the balance again. The Girth chose you, Jack Tenrec, and your partner Hannah Dundee, to rid the world of Scharnhorst. And you get to do it in a red &apos;53 Cadillac with mounted machine guns. While you&apos;re at the task, you must battle hungry, mean dinosaurs, but also be careful not to upset the balance of nature. Also, try not to upset your volcanic-energy fueled caddy by hitting too much obstacles along the way.

Well, he was successful in his efforts, and now Chuck and Ophelia are married. Eventually, they have a son, named Junior. Chuck works in a factory, where he develops great skill at carving automobiles out of stone. A rival manufacturer becomes jealous of Chuck&apos;s abilities and kidnaps him. Now it is up to Junior to rescue his dad! The gameplay in this sequel is similar to the first game, but with some minor differences since you are playing as Junior, rather than Chuck. This is a side-scrolling platform game with occasional rock-moving puzzles thrown in. Unlike Chuck, Junior carries a club that gives his attacks further reach.</story>

    <story>Standard side-scrolling fighter based off of the Stallone film of the same name. Sly must fight thugs and the elements as he tracks down suitcases of stolen cash dropped around the peaks of the Rockies. Combat follows the Final Fight standard, broken up by some mountain climbing and running (or 3-D snowboarding on the Sega CD) from avalanches. Enemies are the standard brawler crooks, occasionally carrying guns and knives the player can pick up. The game tends to follow a pattern of having you deal with a natural hazard (scaling a cliff, leaping over gaps), then locking the screen down for a fighting segment, nature again, fighting again, etc. The available fighting moves is limited, compared to other games of this type, and the ability to hit an enemy character is noticeably less accurate. The plot is identical to the film, with levels based off of, or inspired by, scenes in the movie. Animated cutscenes move the story along on the cartridge systems, while brief clips from the film play between levels on the Sega CD.</story>

It is an on rails style shooter with the player controlling only the aiming of the shooting but not the direction of the helicopter. Your job is to shoot down the enemies as you are flown through footage of New York streets, the Statue of Liberty, the Atlantic Ocean, Italy, the Grand Canyon and finally, the treacherous corners and return fire of the enemy&apos;s stronghold on Easter Island. There is no background music to go along with the sound effects. The levels are fairly short with a total game run through possible in about 20 minutes.</story>

    <story>300 years ago, the high priest of the Kingdom of Cheshire tried to disturb the balance of good and evil by summoning the dark god Arliman. Sabrina, Goddess of Light, saved the Kingdom by giving great powers to two of Cheshire&apos;s leaders who defeated the high priest and helped the King&apos;s high wizard to entrap Arliman in a magical jewel. Velonese, the high wizard&apos;s apprentice, was given the task of guarding the imprisoned Arliman on the Island of Raven. Over the years, his anger towards the kingdom grew and now he is commanding four generals to conquer Cheshire while he is trying to free Arliman. You take on the role of one of four playable main characters and must re-conquer the land that has already fallen into Velonese&apos;s hands and find a way to defeat him and prevent Arliman&apos;s resurrection. The four main characters feature largely different stories, however, every game begins with the King&apos;s death and your character becoming the new ruler of Cheshire. The most important part of the game takes place on various hex maps where you are fighting your enemies in turn-based tactical combat. During these battles your main character - provided he is standing on a castle-field - can summon various monsters like serpents, manticors, harpies etc. or hire human troops(Humans, Dwarfs, Elves and Hobbits). Monsters need magic points to be summoned, whereas humans have to be paid with tax money. Depending on which main character you have chosen, your amount of MP and tax money will vary, as well as the types of monsters you will be able to summon. Your troops, including your main character, gain experience points and humans can even adopt several different jobs (Priest, Mage, Ninja ...) through gaining classes. Your units can also enter towns during battles, to buy weapons and items, hear the latest gossip and maybe even discover a side-quest. In-between battles, you can equip your troops, send out search parties and allocate troops to different towns, as they can be re-conquered by the enemy. Also noteworthy are Dark Wizard&apos;s long animated cutscenes with spoken dialogues and it&apos;s high quality orchestral soundtrack.</story>

    <story>Demolition Man is a game based on the 1993 movie by the same name. As with the movie, the game takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles, in 1996. John Spartan is the country´s most fearsome cop and hunts his nemesis, Simon Phoenix. However in doing so, he kills several innocent civilians and both characters are sentenced to cryostasis rehabilitation where they will be brainwashed for 30 years. However the brainwashing does not go as planned and upon waking up, Phoenix goes on a new crime spree. However in 30 years the world has also changed and Los Angeles has become San Angeles, a utopian and violence-free society. As a remnant of a more violent past, police officer John Spartan is once again sent to capture Phoenix. Demolition Man is a fast-paced platform game, with some levels taking place in an overhead perspective (similar to Smash TV). As John Spartan, the player will spend most of his time shooting endless waves of cryocons released upon the antiseptic world of the future. The standard weapon can be upgraded with a shotgun and magnum, both with limited ammo. Additionally, various types of grenades can be collected, which are thrown independently of the firearm. Simon Phoenix appears as a boss character at the end of every level that is directly tied in with the movie. The Sega CD version of the game retains identical levels and gameplay, but adds digitized clips from the film to introduce levels and advance the plot.</story>

Basically, you can choose from several locations to go to, and at each location you are shown different events through live-action video clips. Clues in the videos will point you to where you should go next. You also have an inventory which you can use to affect the outcome of certain clips (for example, if you enter an asylum with the blackjack you&apos;ll be able to defend yourself against any escaped inmates, but if you don&apos;t bring the blackjack with you you&apos;ll be killed). Time is constantly moving and new events will pop up at different times of the day. In Dracula Unleashed it is the year 1899, ten years after the destruction of count Dracula chronicled in Bram Stoker&apos;s novel. You take the role of Alexander Morris, the younger brother of Texan Quincey Morris who died defeating Dracula. Alexander has come to London to investigate the circumstances of his brother&apos;s death, but became sidetracked when he fell in love with and proposed to a local girl named Annisette. Now, the dawn of a new millennium approaches and an evil force is stalking the streets of London, draining victims of their blood and transforming innocent women into bloodthirsty vampiresses. With the aide of your brother&apos;s old friends, the survivors of Dracula&apos;s evil, you must uncover the identity of this new vampire and prevent him from transforming Annisette into his queen of the night.

    <story>Based on the legendary Frank Herbert novel of the same name and visually inspired by the 1984 David Lynch movie, Dune is a strategy-adventure hybrid where the player takes the role of young Paul Atreides, the son of Duke Leto. The Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV has given the Atreides House the rights to manage the extraction of the most precious substance in the entire universe - the Melange, commonly known as Spice in the desolate desert planet Arrakis (Dune), the only place in the universe capable of producing the substance. While everything indicates the offer is a trap orchestrated by their enemies the Harkonnen, the Atreides family agrees on moving, as he who controls the spice, controls the universe. The player arrives in Arrakis with the mission of contacting and convincing the Fremen tribes residing in sietches (desert settlements) near the Atreides palace to harvest the spice. Harvesting is the most important part of the game, required to purchase equipment from the smugglers and appease the emperor. To speed up the process of harvesting, the player can equip the tribes with harvesters to increase production and ornis to protect them from the gigantic protectors of the planet- Shai-Hulud - the sandworms. However, the spice doesn&apos;t last forever and new sietches must be prospected before having a mining crew assigned, but the player cannot run Southwards forever, as the Harkonnen enemy controls the North of the Planet, dangerously close to the Atreides Palace. Soon after the initial batches are sent to the Emperor, the player will have to actively deal with the Harkonnen, who will try to take control of player Sietches. For those, Fremen tribes can be assigned to military training with Gurney Halleck, but before doing such work Paul must have a certain reputation, gained by the control of Arrakis. As the game advances, the player will untap Paul&apos;s latent powers, as well as meeting other characters from the Dune universe, such as Duke Leto, Jessica, Thufir Hawat, Duncan Idaho, Harah, Chani, Stilgar and Liet Kynes, the mastermind behind the ecological plans on Dune - the ultimate goal.</story>

    <story>The Goddess of Ambition is locked up in the mazes beneath the Darkling tower. A legend is told that once rescued she will grant any wish. A group of heroes stranded in a strange world must attempt to free this divine creature and use her powers to return home. Dungeon Explorer is a Gauntlet clone. Like that classic game, it is a hybrid between an arcade shooter and a traditional RPG. It supports up to 4 players with a choice of 6 different characters/classes- monk, knight, elf, mage, beast and ninja. On the right side of the screen there is a bar with portraits of the characters- pressing the A button brings up the status menu that displays the current level, experience points, statistics, and equipment. The C button fires the equipped weapon, and the B button uses the character&apos;s special ability. The game starts in the area surrounding a save point. This area functions as a central hub to access all the 6 dungeons. If a character leaves it, the food counter starts decreasing. If it reaches zero, the life points start diminishing until the character dies. Food can be found as potions or pots around the mazes. Returning the character to the save point area replenishes all the counters and cures all conditions (like poisoning and confusion). To the north there are two buildings, a weapon shop and a tavern. The gold collected on the game is spent on equipment upgrades at the weapons shop. The tavern (called Jojo&apos;s Bar) allows the player to switch characters. The characters level up automatically as they amass the necessary experience points. Once a dungeon boss is defeated, the dungeon is locked and the player can&apos;t return to it. The game has four save slots, each one for an individual game.</story>

Indeed, you can do pretty much everything a typical dolphin does, including eating fish, surfacing in order to breathe, using your biological sonar and of course, jumping out of the water to amaze your friends. The storyline is actually deeper that one may think by looking at the box illustration. As Ecco, you are the only dolphin who managed to escape from a giant whirlpool which sucked down your entire pod. The five shining stars on your forehead show that you are the chosen one to save them. But that task will be not be an easy one, as you will have to travel through time and space with the Atlantean time machine, and meet the mystical Asterite in order to defeat the Vortex Queen.</story>

    <story>ESPN Sunday Night NFL was one of the many football games released back in the day. It features all 28 official NFL teams and their respective logos, but doesn&apos;t feature a license from the NFLPA, so there are no actual players names in the game. There are four different game modes to choose from- Playoffs, Single Game, Season and another season mode that lets the player act out the 1994 NFL season schedule. It also had variable weather conditions that the players on the field would react to and a battery back-up to save games. It also featured Chris Berman, who not only graced the front cover but also gives commentary as well.</story>

    <story>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football&apos;s world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as isometric) viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games. Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set- fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</story>

Apart from the usual platformer elements, the game has a unique feature- Flink&apos;s ability to create spells. Whenever the game is paused, Flink can combine three ingredients to create a spell. Ingredients can be collected throughout the game. They are usually carried around by a certain type of enemy or hidden in treasure chests. There are ten different spells, the recipes which are contained in scrolls that are given to Flink by rescued elders or found within certain levels. The spells include different attack spells (for example a demon that accompanies Flink and attacks his enemies), a shield spell, a shrink spell, a quick grow spell that lets certain plants grow so that Flink can reach new areas of a level, magic keys that open locked treasure chests and more. Casting spells uses up magic energy that can be replenished by collecting magic bottles or defeating enemies. Similar to the Sonic games, when Flink is hit, he looses all of his magic energy and has only limited time to pick it up again. If he is hit while having no magic energy, he loses a life</story>

    <story>Space aliens are infiltrating the U.S. from a sleepy little town on the Texas/Mexico border, snatching bodies and paving the way for a greater invasion. Those they abduct return as Pod People-like drones, normal in appearance until they reveal themselves. The government&apos;s response is you - a technician driving custom-built gun cameras mounted around the town. Similar to Night Trap or Double Switch, you must monitor the town for alien activity, and respond to protect the lives of the citizens and your agents. The game is played entirely through four camera feeds from locations around the town. They mostly show loops of banal activity, but indicators will alert you when important action is occurring at that location. Switching to that camera will allow you to watch crucial plot clips, or defend that camera from aliens in a single-screen shooting gallery. As cameras take more damage, the picture from that feed degrades until the camera itself is destroyed. The goal is pretty much to juggle between cameras so as not to miss an important plot point, while defending them from attackers or saving citizens from being abducted. In a neat twist, citizens who you failed to save may appear later as disguised aliens themselves. As the game progresses, the invasion increases and becomes more violent, but the basic concept of switching between cameras and engaging in video shooting galleries remains unchanged.</story>

He has some new moves that are provided by his powerful energized whip. Buddy can swing from ceiling in some instances, for example.

    <story>You play as Heimdall, a demi-god based in Norse mythology. Heimdall&apos;s job is to protect the entrance to Asgard, the home of the gods, from all evil, including the terrible Ragnarok, when all the evil forces come together to try and destroy the gods and ultimately everything. Unfortunately Ragnarok is on its way and if that wasn&apos;t bad enough, Loki, god of mischief, has hidden Thor&apos;s hammer, Odin&apos;s sword and Frey&apos;s spear in three worlds. You, as the newly mortalized Heimdall, must visit each of these worlds to collect the god&apos;s weapons. The first is Midgard (or Earth), the second is Utgard (the world of the giants) and the third is Asgard itself, the home of the gods. Each world has around 15 islands and each island has countless rooms. When you start your mission you are given three sub-games to complete. How well you complete these games determines Heimdall&apos;s stats (strength, agility etc) as well as how many people he can choose from to make up his party. If you don&apos;t do well then you won&apos;t get the full 30 characters to choose from and some of the better ones will not be available to you. The first sub-game is the Axe Throwing Contest. Here you must throw axes at a young barmaid tied to a stock by her pig-tails. The idea is to hit the pig-tails and not her! Unfortunately because Heimdall is a bit drunk, your cursor wobbles all over the place! The second sub-game is Pig Catching (where you must chase and hopefully catch a pig in its pen) and the third is the Long Boat Fight (where you must try and get to the other side of the long boat without being thrown overboard). Once you&apos;ve done this it&apos;s time to wander around the isometric landscape solving puzzles and killing baddies (in a similar style to Cadaver) until you eventually find one of the god&apos;s missing weapons.</story>

Between races, you must mend the damage your car has sustained, which eats up your prize money. Background music is selected through a dashboard CD player, which also features some rather uninspiring radio stations.

    <story>Remember the days as a kid when you were fascinated with these big machines on the building site? With this game you have the opportunity to try them out! You can use either the excavator, bulldozer, steamroller or wrecking ball. The handling couldn&apos;t be easier, there are just three buttons to press- left, right and use. With each machine you get a simple task, e.g. carry three shovels of dirt on a truck. But the fun thing is that you aren&apos;t restricted to this and can just screw around. Why wreck an old house when the pit latrine is so much more tempting? The whole game is presented in full motion video - the reactions are very humorous and with a fair share of slapstick. To improve the long time motivation there are even multiple videos for every action, e.g. the first time you break a road block with the the excavator you drive on a highway, the second time into a canyon, the third time onto a rollercoaster and so on...</story>

    <story>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story) starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in Project 5, a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe&apos;s intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world. While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe&apos;s best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</story>

Shifting the cursor to the edge of the screen changes to a different track when available, with incorrect turns either killing you instantly or moving you off-course from the level end. Direction indicators and distant landmarks help keep you driving in the right direction, while accidents, track closures, and robot cops work to keep you from it. Your weapons tag enemies and force them to explode, or can tag incoming shots and deflect them with a separate shield button. Gameplay is broken into three levels as you race from one destination to another to escape with your cargo. The game features sophisticated full-motion video cutscenes breaking up the levels and providing the story. Barry Primus and Ned Beatty star.</story>

The Garuda Empire has invaded the lands of Mistral, and the six Dark Generals, led by Sornbul, have conquered the continents. Sornbul&apos;s ambition is nothing less than to resurrect Deoric and plunge the land into chaos.

After completing all six continents the player will face Sornbul on the final island. Before a level the player can choose from one of four elemental armors, each with its own bullet spread and unique bomb. The armor&apos;s attack can be powered up several levels by finding jewels dropped by enemies. This power level, as well as the armor&apos;s health, is reduced when hit.

You control Hiro, a young treasure hunter who likes exploring various caves and ruins with his trusty companion, the wise-cracking pink flying cat Ruby (who claims to be a baby dragon). One day he meets a mysterious blue-haired girl named Lucia. She explains that she has come from the nearby Blue Star and now needs his help in order to defeat a dark being called Zophar. Bewitched by the girl&apos;s beauty, Hiro agrees to help Lucia, and soon finds himself opposing the ruling religion of the world, and shadows from the past. This is a console-style RPG with turn-based combat viewed from top-down perspective, like the rest of the game. You fight with a party where each member belongs to a particular class and fights using his/her own techniques. Animé-style cut scenes are included to advance the story.</story>

    <story>Mary Shelly&apos;s Frankenstein is an adventure/fighting hybrid based on the 1994 film of the same name. You play as Frankenstein&apos;s monster and begin in the lab, where your creator rejects and banishes you in a dialogue sequence. From there, you must escape the village and try to find meaning in a hostile world. Subsequent levels mirror the general story arc of the film and novel. The game plays through three distinct modes- 1. Exploration Mode takes place inside buildings, and gives you a side-scrolling view of the Monster. Like a standard adventure, you can examine nearby objects and add them to a limited inventory. You use those items to solve puzzles or open up new pathways. Should you encounter a hostile foe in this mode, you will automatically switch to Combat Mode. 2. Combat Mode plays and looks like a standard 2-D fighting game. You have buttons to punch, kick, or block, and corresponding D-pad directions that activate different moves. Your goal is to drain your opponent&apos;s energy while preserving your own. Winning the fight allows you to continue on. 3. Long View Mode is an isometric travel view similar to an RPG. Here, you search for new buildings to enter or navigate mazes (such as a forest). The game shifts between hand-drawn art and 3-D computer graphics. Video clips from the film also introduce the game, and play at critical plot points. The package includes a complete CD and and manual for Bram Stoker&apos;s Dracula as an added bonus.</story>

The player watches the video and hits the correct direction or button at the right time to achieve success. The visual cues of the movie suggest the correct buttons. For example, when the Masked Rider punches, the player should press the Punch button. If he dodges left on screen, the player should press the left direction pad. Correct timing hits the enemy harder, lowering their health bar. Failure reduces the players health. Completing the moves accurately will allow the player to defeat the monster early and watch the rest of the video as a reward</story>

    <story>In the year 2051, two mega corporations battle it out for supremacy over an overcrowded, overpolluted planet. CyberTech Industries, the dominant company on the planet, is being challenged by Axiom, who blames the former for their president&apos;s death. To gain revenge, they secretly inject CyberTech&apos;s president, Anton Korsby, with a virus that threatens to take over his body, and ultimately destroy himself and CyberTech. Your mission is to enter Korsby&apos;s body, destroy the virus, and defeat the organism that controls his brain. Microcosm is a 3D action shooter, similar to Descent, that takes place entirely within the human body. The concept was inspired by the 1966 movie Fantastic Voyage. The player pilots his way through various parts of the anatomy, blasting virii and enemy ships, while gaining power-ups and faster, stronger craft. The goal of the game is to eventually reach the brain to stop Grey M, the entity that controls Korsby&apos;s body. Microcosm makes heavy use of full-motion video and features high-resolution fractal graphics (to simulate the walls of veins and arteries), digital music and sound effects.</story>

    <story>A FMV rail shooter placing you in the helmet of rookie chopper gunner Joker. Terrorists have kidnapped a German biochemist and taken him to a Middle Eastern oil refinery, where he is forced to work on a lethal toxin. Joker and crew must fly to the refinery, shooting down enemy tanks and helicopters, then Joker must rappel down to the refinery and rescue the chemist on foot. The helicopter sections follow a pattern similar to Tomcat Alley, showing brief clips of the cast in the cockpit, followed by a nose camera shot of an enemy approaching. During this shot, you have the ability to move a set of crosshairs over the enemy and press the fire button. If you&apos;re on target, you are rewarded with military archival footage of helicopters shooting rockets, and close up footage of models exploding. The on-foot sections follow an identical pattern, though with hand-held cameras placing you in the eyes of Joker, and black-clad guards taking the place of helicopters. Otherwise, the idea of having a few seconds to react and aim crosshairs is the same. The plot is expanded through occasional cutscenes in both the helicopter and foot sections.</story>

The footage is spliced from nine different episodes and the gameplay is reminiscent of games such as Dragon&apos;s Lair and Space Ace where the player must press a button at a certain time to avoid being punched, kicked, avoid a trap, etc. Failure to miss pressing a button will continue to play the footage, but cause the player to loose a life. After a certain set of lives are lost, the game will be over.</story>

    <story>Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung. Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung&apos;s mysterious island- Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself. Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent. When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a Fatality on the loser. The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale. Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game&apos;s fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</story>

    <story>After establishing themselves in the virtual rinks, EA combined both NHL and NHLPA licenses in NHL &apos;94, allowing them to feature all 26 real teams (including both expansion teams) and players of the new NHL season for the first time in the series. Aside from the licenses, the gameplay for this edition sees for the first time the inclusion of the devastating one-timer shot, but to keep forwards (literally) in check, defenders also feature harder body checks, with new animations. For an additional challenge, players can also choose to control the goalkeeper manually. A popular feature in previous editions, fighting is completely removed from the game. Game modes include exhibition games (or regular season in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) and an all new shoot-out mode. The main options remain basically the same couple since the establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties. (off, on, on but no offsides). While there are some minor differences between platforms (Genesis features record keeping for users and the MegaCD version has more stat screens, CD quality audio backdrops and the usual highlight clips here and there), only the PC version released at the same time features complete season action.</story>

Frank Cifaldi, editor of Lost Levels brought the game to the public after being handed a copy by a magazine reviewer. It is a compilation of minigames and a platform game starring the two magicians, made to fool your friends. The game has become famous due to the inclusion of the Desert Bus minigame. In Desert Bus, the player drives a bus across the United States, from Tucson, Arizona to Las Vegas, Nevada at a real-time maximum speed of 45 miles per hour. This means the journey is eight hours long, and as the game cannot be paused, play is continuous. There is no scenery to speak of and no traffic, and the bus always veers slightly to the right, meaning the player cannot let go of the controller within that time. The journey is also a perfectly straight line, and once you&apos;ve arrived at Las Vegas, you will score one point and be offered the chance to take the trip back.The score counter goes up to a maximum of 99, meaning gameplay is 41 days long. This minigame is used annually for the Desert Bus For Hope charity event, who have raised $233,678.47 in the last three years by getting people to play Desert Bus for as long as possible. Supposedly the realistic journey time was built in direct response to the video game controversy surrounding many violent games of the time.</story>

While you might think that a cute Anime chick would have no trouble making a living slashing bad guys with her sword, Popful is having a hard time making ends meet. One day, however, Popful learns about a magician who has gone rogue and has a hefty bounty on his head. So, her adventure begins as Popful fights her way through a new adventure, and makes new friends along the way. Primarily this is an action game with very slight RPG elements. As you make your way through the plethora of levels, you will have to collect money from slain foes. You use this money in the shops to buy weapons, armor, health, and so on. Also, this game features interaction with many, many characters through both on-screen dialog and fully animated sequences. Some of these characters become playable as you progress through the game. This release has the same story and general gameplay style as the earlier version, but otherwise was made from scratch, having entirely different graphics, locations, enemies, challenges, etc.</story>

    <story>The first of Digital Pictures&apos; Make My Video line has you editing three of C + C Music Factory&apos;s most famous songs - Gonna Make You Sweat, Things That Make You Go Hmm... and Here We Go Let&apos;s Rock &amp; Roll. The plot puts you inside the music factory of the game&apos;s name, where two linemen sweat and toil under the oppressive thumb of a wheelchair-bound corporate executive. Video discs literally roll down an assembly line while C + C record their sounds behind three closed doors. You are asked to help out in editing these videos, appease the corporate masters, and lift the burden from everyone. The game is played from a panel meant to resemble and act as a non-linear editor. Editing is entirely linear however, as three distinct video feeds run simultaneously along the bottom of the screen. Each is mapped to the A, B, or C button, and pressing one sends that video to master viewer, where it is recorded. The D-pad toggles various effects on and off from a bin in the upper left. One feed will always be of C + C&apos;s actual video, with the other two holding appropriate stock footage (like a doorbell timed to appear with the lyrics Ding dong, who is it?) The video can not be stopped or rewound once the editing process begins, so the player must quickly route video to the viewer and apply effects within a given amount of time. This allows for editing challenges, where the player must fill specific requests, like having fast cuts or showing no dancers. After a video is edited, the player gets to watch their cut in its entirety. They are then graded by the FMV characters and move to the next song, or try a new edit of the previous one.</story>

The gameworld is now made up of polygons, so the view can be rotated and moved with greater freedom than Populous. Trade, diplomacy, inventions, and scorched earth invasions all play a key role in how the player progressed through the game. Two-player games via modem links are available on computer versions.</story>

    <story>The Grand Vizier Jaffar has thrown you into a dark dungeon and plans to marry the girl of your dreams in an hour. You&apos;re not going to let that happen are you? Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar&apos;s guards, find your way through the Sultan&apos;s palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you&apos;ve got 60 minutes! Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character. The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</story>

    <story>Revengers of Vengeance is a combination RPG/vertical shooter/fighting game with a fantasy/anime style. There are ten available characters, each with their own animated backstory and fighting techniques. You must choose a hero and guide their stats to create a formidable fighter capable of taking down the Devil King and freeing the land. In the Quest mode, you name your selected character and start at a lowly Level 1. The local town acts as a hub with opportunities for training, equipment purchases and rest. You can leave town and battle contenders for money in the fighting game. You can advance the story by taking quests from the town&apos;s guild, which are played in the vertical shooter game. The fighting engine is further explored in two side modes - Tournament and Arena of Death. Tournament acts as a basic fighting game, allowing 1 or 2 players to progress through the ranks with the stock characters. No customization is available in this mode. Arena of Death allows eight players to be created using the stock character templates. You assign attributes by shifting various bars between two extremes. You can then match these creations against each other and watch as the computer simulates a battle between them. The primary use of this mode appears to be testing various tactics against each other to decide how best to play your character.</story>

Players assume the role of an angry cop on a wild ride as he pursues a gang of bikers who killed his wife. Players need to race through oncoming traffic, squeeze between trucks, trash motorcycles and steer through lots of explosions. The only thing needed are quick reflexes to follow the instructions on the screen (with an increasing difficulty) in order to keep the animation going. The action is shown from a first-person view and fast-paced, while still maintaining smooth and detailed anime drawn graphics.</story>

    <story>This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other Road Rashers who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you- you can either do your best to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place. There are five circuits to race- The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup. There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class. If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game&apos;s Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie- you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place. The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game&apos;s options menu.</story>

The cruel pirate LeChuck is deeply in love with her - so deeply that he refuses to accept his own death! As a ghost, he dwells with his undead crew somewhere near the mysterious Monkey Island. You are Guybrush Threepwood, a young man whose only wish is to become a real pirate. At the Scumm Bar you meet three pirates who tell you&apos;ll have to complete three difficult tasks in order to be worthy of this title. Could Guybrush ever suspect that while trying to complete those tasks, he will encounter the governor Elaine Marley, fall in love with her, and face the anger of the dreadful ghost pirate LeChuck?! This is when Guybrush&apos; adventure truly begins! The Secret of Monkey Island is an adventure game that utilizes the command verb-based SCUMM interface first introduced in Maniac Mansion- you construct commands for Guybrush by clicking on the appropriate verb, and then clicking on the inventory item or an object in the room you want to interact with. It is the first LucasArts&apos; adventure game in which it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck or to die. The branching dialogue system, where you choose one of the available responses while talking to people, allows you to talk to characters in different ways without fearing a wrong choice. There are plenty of inventory-based puzzles to solve, and even insult swordfighting to participate in, where Guybrush has to prove his wit is as sharp as his sword!</story>

    <story>Silpheed for the Sega CD is a shoot-&apos;em-up sequel to the PC title of the same name. Gameplay is similar- this is basically a 2D shooter with 3D graphics. You move your ship in a 2D plane that reaches into the screen, kind of like a pinball table. The Sega CD version of Silpheed uses pre-rendered video for the backdrops, and filled polygon graphics for the player ship and enemies. The story here is typical for a game of this type. The central computer system controlling the galaxy network has been hacked by terrorists. The terrorists are using the computer to attack colony planets throughout the system. You are the Galaxy Union&apos;s last resort- you must fight your way across 11 stages to reach Earth, and re-take control of the computer.</story>

    <story>December 2042, Neo Kobe City, a city of madness and decadence... Mankind is facing its gravest crisis. A mysterious bio-roid life form has appeared. Its true nature and purpose are unknown. Is it some country&apos;s secret weapon, or an alien from another world? They appear in the winter, killing people and taking their place in society. They wear artificial skin and can sweat and even bleed. They are called Snatchers because they snatch their victims before they take their place. A new police force, specifically trained to fight the Snatchers, has been formed. They are JUNKERs (Judgement Uninfected Naked Kind and Execute Rangers). Every time you encounter someone, a difficult question must be asked — IS IT A PERSON OR A SNATCHER? You are Gillian Seed, one of the JUNKERs. Your mission is largely adventure-based, with manga-style graphics and voice acting. Each room has objects to pick up, examine and use. Conversation with other characters is a key plot element. A few short shooting gallery type scenes add an action element. While the game is generally scary or comic, a few moments border on the sensual.</story>

    <story>The Space Adventure is known in Japan as Cobra II- Densetsu no Otoko, the second game dedicated to the adventures of the renegade space pirate Cobra. The game is based on original manga and TV series by Buichi Terasawa. While waiting in a bar for his partner, Cobra encounters a beautiful bounty hunter named Jane. Very soon he realizes that the bounty Jane has been hunting for is his own head, for which the Galaxy Patrol has put quite a reward. But everything changes when Crystal Boy, the head of the Pirate Guild and Cobra&apos;s archenemy, appears on the scene. Jane&apos;s father had apparently hidden a great treasure, encoding its location in tattoos on the backs of his triplet daughters. Crystal Boy wants this treasure, and is going after Jane and her sisters. Cobra and Jane decide to join forces in order to find Jane&apos;s sisters and to undermine Crystal Boy&apos;s plans. The game is a Japanese-style adventure. You advance in the game by choosing various commands (Look, Talk, etc.). There are a few places in the game where you can die if you make a wrong decision. In the final location you&apos;ll also have to fight enemies turn-based style. The game features a large number of animated cut scenes as well as voice-overs for many dialogues.</story>

    <story>In the future, the world is controlled by a handful of global corporations (syndicates). You are the Marketing director (hit man) for one of these companies. It is your job to take control away from the competitors. The job is not one of diplomacy, but one of brute force and physical control. Advance your way to the top of the corporation by successfully completing your missions and managing the money you make from your territories. The gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, with an angled top-down perspective, but it is real time rather than turn based. You have missions ranging from infiltrate and capture, to seek and destroy. In each of these you direct a team of four agents as they move through the world shooting at anything that gets in their way. You can upgrade and modify your agents, as well as equip them with tools you have researched or liberated from opposing syndicates. As you complete missions, you gain more funds to use for purchasing agents or researching upgrades and equipment.</story>

    <story>Similar to adaptations of The Terminator on other systems, the Sega CD game is a platformer where the player controls Kyle Reese, who travels back in time from the year 2029 to protect Sarah Connor from the unstoppable killing machine known as the Terminator. The game consists of 10 levels. Future locations include the post-apocalyptic wasteland of 2029 Los Angeles and the time displacement complex. In the present of 1984, Reese must traverse the streets and rooftops of L.A., as well as the Tech Noir club, the police station, and, for the finale, an automated factory. Reese is armed with a gun with unlimited ammo as well as a limited number of grenades to dispatch the many enemies, including Terminators and HKs in the future and punks in the present. In addition to these, several bosses must also be fought. The boss battles include several encounters with the Terminator, who naturally cannot be completely destroyed until the finale, but must be driven back to keep him from harming Sarah. Between levels, the game shows small digitized clips from the film that advance the storyline. The game also features a fully CD-based soundtrack with tracks ranging from heavy rock to electronic tunes.</story>

    <story>Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park&apos;s allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides. Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay. You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don&apos;t let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides. It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</story>

In the Classic Game, up to 6 players roll an on-screen die and move their &apos;pie-dish&apos; marker around the spoke-and-wheel game board, just like the board game. The square you land on is color coded to one of six trivia categories- People &amp; Places, Sports &amp; Leisure, History, Arts &amp; Entertainment, Science &amp; Nature, and Wild Card. Answering the trivia question correctly lets you take another turn. Further, if you are on the &apos;prize&apos; square at the end of each spoke (1 spoke end for each category color), the correct answer grants you a colored pie piece in your pie-dish marker for that category. Once you have all 6 pie pieces in your dish, you need to head back to the hub for a final random question to win the game. In the Fast Game, up to 6 players can forgo the die-rolling and board movement. It&apos;s a race to answer correctly a question from each category first! Categories are randomly selected in this mode.</story>

    <story>Although the package appears to be a compilation, this is the first and only release of Ultraverse Prime. Since it was originally envisioned as a SNES game but not completed, it was eventually released as a Sega CD title as a pack-in with Microcosm, a game that was released separately before. As such this should be considered the base entry for Ultraverse Prime. It is a sidescrolling brawler game similar to Final Fight or Streets of Rage. Players control the superhero Prime, a thirteen year-old boy called Kevin Green that has the power to transform into a superhero adult version of himself. Prime can punch, kick and jump, and combine these into some new moves and combos. The player as well as the enemies can also occasionally find weapons or objects to pick up and throw. Some stages are much faster as Prime flies at a fast speed and needs to punch obstacles and enemies out of the air. As a bonus, fifteen different Prime comic book issues can be accessed through the main menu, as well as video interviews with the writers and artists. The game design has the typical SNES feel, with no changes made to match the advanced options of the Sega CD platform. Compared to the SNES prototype, even though the graphics style is the same, the fighting style is slightly different and a 7-minute rock theme song was added along with the bonus features mentioned above.</story>

On what is to be the day of their wedding, Castle Lorath is assaulted by the Danek, who have been able to partially reconstruct alien mecha technology from a millennium ago. The castle defenses are powerless against the giant robots, and the king and queen are killed in the attack. The invaders steal Elin in the midst of her wedding vows. Prince Sandor, now the king of the realm, sets out to rescue his betrothed, and find a way to defeat the fearsome alien technology. The game is a thoroughly old-school Japanese-style RPG, meaning that the focus of the game is on fighting random enemies in turn-based combat, gaining experience and gold in process, without any additional gimmicks. The characters come with pre-set classes (wizard, bard, etc.), and learn their own abilities/magic spells automatically as they level up.</story>
