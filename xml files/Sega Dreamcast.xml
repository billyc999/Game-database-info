    <story>4 Wheel Thunder is the off-road racing sequel to the popular power-boat racing game, Hydro Thunder. In this game, players race around two types of courses; huge outdoor tracks and smaller indoor tracks. All in all, there are 24 areas in which to race, including various day/night, rain/sunshine variations. The game includes the standard championship, practice race, and 2-player modes. The thunder series of games is unique in that the key to winning the race lies not in careful steering and braking, but in finding the &amp;quot;boost&amp;quot; power-ups that lie around the tracks. Each boost icon adds a few seconds of time to your boost meter. The player then can press a boost button to increase the speed of his or her truck dramatically. Without the boost power-ups, the player has no hope of winning a race.</story>

The actual racing game is based very heavily on Terminal Reality&apos;s Monster Truck Madness series of games, except with SUV&apos;s instead of monster trucks. One significant feature of 4x4 Evo is the online multi-player option. The Dreamcast, PC, and Macintosh versions can compete against each other in 4 player online races. In addition to the on-line mode of play, there is a single player career mode. The career mode gives you a small allotment of money with which to purchase a truck. You then can compete in races to earn more money for more trucks or performance parts for your current truck.</story>

    <story>90 minutes is a traditional action football game, featuring 7 leagues (England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, plus an assortment of clubs from around the world) and national teams. While there are no team licenses, most players feature real names and there&apos;s also a player and team editor, allowing to change name and number of players, who&apos;s in each national team, as well as creating teams from scratch, including its players. Gameplay follows the norms of the genre - A to pass, B to throw a high lob, X to shoot, Y to change players, with the triggers to perform modifiers (though passes and lob shots) and sprint, although these can all be changed in the options. The player can also assign special tactics to each direction on the d-pad to adapt quickly according to the flow of the game. Game modes include the usual - World Championship (based on the world cup), as well as national leagues and cups (as well as a customizable cup), with secret teams waiting to be unlocked by those who win them, exhibition and training. Options are also the usual on these kind of games - change half lenght (3,5 or 10 minutes), opponent level and game speed. At gametime, players can also choose the weather, time of day, and between 10 cameras. There are six stadiums to choose from, inspired by venues such as the old Wembley Stadium, the Nou Camp or the ArenA in Amsterdam.</story>

    <story>Advanced Daisenryaku 2001 is a traditional turn-based strategy game. The original Japanese release was the second entry in Sega&apos;s Advanced Daisenryaku series, with gameplay very similar to that of it&apos;s 16-bit predecessor, changing some details and using 3D animations for the combat cutscenes. The game uses a hex-based map and features fog-of-war, weather, unit experience, unit upgrading, supply, and other common strategy wargame features. Unlike the previous game, three campaigns are available instead of one. Japanese, as well as United States forces can be commanded now in addition to German units. The scenarios that are played during a campaign can change depending on the battle results - a successful player may invade North America for example. There are also ten scenarios with pre-set forces separately available for selection in Standard Mode, during which the control of all involved armies can be switched to a human player.</story>

The most important modes selectable are free flight, which as the name implies gives you freedom to fly what you want (land it in the middle of a freeway if you&apos;d like or next to skyscrapers) and over what type of weather and the split-screen versus mode (2 player). In addition to those modes, the game features training in over 30 fighter training missions and 15 tactical challenges. Successful completion of these challenges will unlock additional fighters (including the XF-3 Super Recipro, F-2B Support Fighter or F-15DJ Aggressor 2 to name a few) and decals/paint for the plane models. As far as the realism goes, the game is customizable with options for either Standard or Professional Flight controls. The main difference between the two being the inclusion of more realistic G-Forces on your plane. It&apos;s also important to note that the controls are nearly identical to the first game with one or two buttons difference.</story>

In addition to the pure emulation modes, there is an option to display the cabinet art surrounding the display of each game, intended to give the player a sense of actually playing a stand-up machine. Each game also has a toggle for an enhanced graphical mode, which varies from game to game. For instance, enhanced asteroids merely has a static backdrop, whereas enhanced warlords is a complete graphical overhaul with new colors. It should be noted that the enhanced version of Tempest is none other than Tempest Tubes, a modification for Tempest made in 1982 by Duncan Brown. Also included is a gallery of game memorabilia, video clips of an interview with Nolan Bushnell, and desktop themes for Windows.</story>

    <story>My Tennis Life in English is the work of the super small software house Bimboosoft (poor soft, as in no money) who also brought Dreamcast lovers the very nice Jetcoaster Dream 1 and 2. Boku No Tennis Jinsei isn&apos;t really what I&apos;d call a premium tennis game such as Power Smash or even games such as the classic Super Tennis or Family Tennis on the Super Famicom. The problem with this game is that the collision detection seems to be off at times meaning that you can actually hit the ball even though you can clearly see that your racket didn&apos;t touch it. Add the fact that it&apos;s pretty tough to judge distance and you have yourself one dodgy tennis game. Still, it does have a charm that makes it worth picking up if you can find it cheap enough. The problem is that you probably won&apos;t find it cheap enough since this was never really released in great numbers making it quite a tough one to find these days</story>

    <story>A futuristic sci-fi shooter in which you play a test pilot strapped to the brand new RAIN combat simulator which allows you to remotely control fighters as they immerse themselves in the midst of enemy territory. The game is a side-scrolling shooter in which you control your ship and try to survive the onslaught of enemy attacks while you attempt to clear the levels. Weapon upgrades are based on collectible power-ups, but the game mostly relies on a power bar that fills as you destroy enemies and which allows you to unleash your super weapon at the expense of decreased normal firepower. The game also features a unique border system which involves three separate routes through each stage. You select the default route at the start of a level and when your ship is destroyed you get knocked down to the next border, which features alternate backgrounds and enemy patterns. Only if you get knocked off the last border you lose the game. Uses completely polygonal graphics and features single player arcade, remix and practice modes through 6 enemy-infested stages, the last of which has four unique variations.</story>

    <story>The 4th edition of Bust-A-Move adds some great new characters to choose from, as well as a Story mode, where you win Tarrot cards from each puzzle you complete. Player VS. CPU has two different modes- Story mode sees a story unfold as you defeat each CPU character (and changes depending on the character you start with) and Win Contest is a simple how many games can I win in a row against the computer. Finally, if you complete the Challenge mode (where you must complete certain puzzels as fast as possible, and get judged on technique, speed etc.) the Edit mode will become available. In here you can put together your own puzzles for you or your friends to complete.</story>

    <story>Buzz Lightyear is based on an animated movie and television series of the same name. Buzz Lightyear is an elite space ranger, who travels from planet to planet hunting down supervillians. In this game, you control Buzz through 14 missions on eight different planets. In each mission, your goal is to race to the end of the level before the bad guy does. If you do so successfully, you face off against the villian, and hopefully capture them. In addition to capturing the villain, there are secondary objectives like collecting robot parts and getting the fastest time through the level. Buzz Lightyear of Star Command is a spinoff of the Toy Story series of movies.</story>

These different grooves alter the character&apos;s abilities to resemble different Capcom or SNK games. There are three grooves dedicated for each company, and even the option to define a custom groove. The EO of the GameCube and Xbox titles refers to a new groove- Easy Operation. Instead of the normal inputs needed to do special and super moves, these moves are instead done automatically by tapping the right thumb-stick in specific directions. Only a small part of each character&apos;s moveset can be accessed this way, however, and if the player does not select EO then the game will play the same as the arcade and previous releases..</story>

You are sent in by Helicopter to investigate a carrier that has not been responding to radio contact after completing a mission. As you approach the deck of the carrier, your helicopter is shot down. After crash landing on the deck, it is your job to investigate what exactly is going on, and escape alive. The game is played from a third person perspective. You move Jack around the ship, shooting enemies and solving simple puzzles along the way. The main goal of the game is to survive, so you have to be careful about conserving ammo and health upgrades. After you solve the game playing as Jack, you can play through the game again as Jessifer Manning, one of your teammates. While playing as Jessifer, you get an entirely different view of the same story.</story>

    <story>Charge &apos;N Blast is a shooting game where you play as one of three marines who have to rid the earth of alien scum. The gameplay is similar to Cabal, you move left and right dodging enemies while charging up you weapons to blast them away. There are three different marines you can choose from, each with their own set of weapons. As usual there is the balanced character (Johnny Rock), a weaker but faster one (Pamela Hewitt) and a slower but stronger one (Nicholas Woods). You can choose to play in one player mode, time attack or two player mode. The missions are broken up into small areas where you have to kill all enemies before moving on to the next area. Each mission ends with a boss character such as a giant insect or a Godzilla-like monster. Use the X, Y or B buttons to choose a weapon, press A to charge and shoot and aim with analog stick. There are different types of weapons that can be used on the different types of enemies. For example the single missiles for far away targets and torpedoes for underwater enemies. You can fire your weapon continuously, but this doesn&apos;t do as much damage compared to a fully charged shot. Charging each shot means you have to aim a little more carefully, but you&apos;ll especially need this in the later levels. You can dodge enemies with the L and R buttons.</story>

The game is tricky to play due to the positioning of the buttons that you have to do using the analogue controller and at times impossible to judge what is the next button to press. But it&apos;s not all bad. The graphics are ok but I think Samba De Amigo is much better looking.

Additional time is given at the start of the next level depending on how well the player did. To clear the room, the player has to hit a ball with a racket at the correct angle. The ball bounces back from the blocks and walls. The blocks have different properties, for example, some have to be hit multiple times before they disappear, while others move around thus making them harder to hit. Besides the regular shot, the player can also perform a trick shot, which in combination with other moves gives extra points when successfully executed. At the end of each level, a map with branching paths is displayed, enabling the player to take different routes towards the end of the game.</story>

    <story>Crazy Taxi is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can&apos;t be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short. In the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks- a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly. Next to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B or A, with S for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).</story>

In Crazy Taxi, you crashed your taxi through the streets as fast as possible, making money by performing stunts and picking up/dropping off passengers to certain destinations. For Crazy Taxi 2, you can pick up more then one passenger at a time, meaning more money faster, new stunts including the &apos;hop&apos;, which allows you to hop over buildings and take the quick route past the traffic, and plenty of mini games, such as Crazy Golf.</story>

    <story>Canada, Christmas 2000 ... In the skies over Canada, Laura´s plane has been hijacked by terrorists. The plane is filled with screams, shouts and fear as the hijackers terrorize the passengers and crew. In one of the seats a black robed magician gazes into a crystal, chanting the phrase Shadow, the final destroyer. Mysterious indeed. Laura´s compact begins to glow. A vision of a meteorite hurtling towards the Earth is reflected in the mirror. Suddenly the plane is struck by the same meteorite that appeared in the vision, and falls towards the frozen tundra below. In the middle of a raging blizzard, Laura opens her eyes to find herself inside a mountain cabin. She was saved by Kimberly, one of the passengers of the wrecked plane. 10 days have passed since the crash but Laura can remember nothing, not even her name. The door of the cabin opens and one of the terrorists enters. While Kimberly and Laura stare in horror, he transforms into a hideous monster. He is not the only one. Other crash survivors and locals have mutated into terrifying monstrosities and attacked people. Is there anyway to survive this living nightmare? At present it is shrouded in mystery. D2 combines classical survival horror exploration and first person combat with a RPG typical experience/level system. You play the mysterious heroine Laura, stranded in a vast snowy landscape after a plane crash and struck with amnesia about the last 10 days. The 3d engine allows you to freely move around the world, pilot snow mobiles, hunt for food or even capture photos. You will meet a variety of people and have to fight gruesome creatures and dangerous monsters. As the story advances you slowly regain your memory and unfold a terrifying plot about the end of the world.</story>

The PC mode also offers more car choices, with a variety of speed, acceleration, and grip characteristics. It even rewards successful players (meaning those finishing first, second, or third in the difficult setting) by offering up to ten more upgraded cars to drive.

    <story>On July 29, 2010, the city of Saronica comes under attack by an army of monsters called the SMO as they lay siege to the city, capturing it and ruling the populace under an iron fist. During this, The Resistance is formed in an attempt to stop the SMO, lead by a woman by the name of Lily who is kidnapped when she attempts to help a man by the name of Kou. After she is captured, it is learned the man has come into possession of two ancient pistols by the name of Crimson that can destroy the monsters and their vicious leader. Kou sets out with Lily&apos;s daughter, Yuri, to bring her back and stop the evil forces within the city. Death Crimson is a light-gun game similar in style to House of the Dead where the player shoots at enemies that pop up on screen and save innocents from the monsters. The player can also power-up the Crimson pistols by shooting death flowers that will turn their firepower into machine guns to decimate hordes of enemies. There is also a health meter that will increase in size by successfully shooting enemies, gaining experience points. Once enough points are obtained, the health bar will increase, however missing enemies or shooting civilians will take away points.</story>

    <story>Three years ago a brilliant scientist disappeared while researching a new form of energy. The government that funded his research wrote the whole affair off as a loss, which made it all the more upsetting when reports of Dr. Kirk&apos;s good health and nearly finished research came in. A special forces team is sent to the doctor&apos;s private island laboratory to extract him and his research, but they are totally unprepared for some of the side effects of his developments. Side effects that come from 100 million years in the past. Dino Crisis is a survival horror game that is very similar in both control and gameplay to its sister series, Resident Evil. As in that series, protagonist Regina will have limited supplies and ammo with which to fight deadly enemies while searching rooms for keys (some figurative, some literal) to open locked areas. Unlike Resident Evil games, Regina will find very few actual supplies laying around, and will instead find plugs that are used to open caches of emergency supplies located around the complex. There are only enough plugs to open some of these caches, however, so care must be taken to decide what items are really needed. In another change from Resident Evil, the game is rendered in 3D, allowing the camera to rotate or pan, although camera angles are still out of the control of the player. Even the dumbest dinosaur is smarter than the undead, and enemies can chase and disarm Regina, and even occasionally follow her through doors.</story>

    <story>DUX is a scrolling shooter in the vein of R-Type. When scientists searched for new materials to enhance their space ships, they discovered a new and powerful material they dubbed DUX. Since this type of material proved unstable, nobody except the player seemed brave enough to fly the space ship constructed from it. The player&apos;s job is to lead the ship through a series of horizontal levels against the Spiritual Spacers to reach the obvious. The player&apos;s ship has a standard laser shot that can be upgraded or changed for x-ray and bounce shots, which are very similar to the weapons in R-Type. The player also has a pod that protects them from enemy bullets and that can be launched as an offensive weapon in a move called dash. Keeping the fire button pressed will launch a more powerful hyper shot. To score points, the player can destroy chains of enemies in quick succession or soak up chains of bullets. Hyper Soaking makes the player invulnerable to bullets, but drains the Obvious Energy gauge if not enough bullets are soaked in or new energy orbs are picked up. The player wins the game if they manage to beat all the bosses at the end of each level. If they are hit by a bullet or collide with their surroundings, a life is lost. After all lives and continues are depleted, the game is over.</story>

Mag Launcher, the son of a great adventurer of the past, has earned the title of best adventurer in the town Pannam. The adventurer guild (called the Society) sends him to the south, to the large town Museville. Mag has to explore the surrounding dungeons, performing various archaeological quests for the Society. The game is more like a second chapter to the first Evolution than an actual sequel. You control the same party of characters- Mag, the cute girl Linear Cannon, the butler Gre Naid, and the adventurers Chain and Pepper. The dungeons are randomly generated. In those dungeons, you can find rare artifacts you can later sell, and special weapon enhancements called CyFrame, which can upgrade your characters and teach them various techniques.

The group that you control ranges from Kangaroos and Penguins to Cats and Dogs, all with their unique abilities and styles of fighting, which you must use to not only defeat the Stupid Bears, but complete puzzles and specific objectives along the way. You can control only one character at a time, but there are teleport areas so that you can change your character to one that can complete the tasks at hand.</story>

    <story>As many as four (Expansion Pak required) can band together in an epic quest through seven magical worlds -- three of which are brand-new to the home version -- to defeat the vile Skorne. The nonlinear action begins in a hub, which leads to the worlds, each with two to five levels. You can complete a level in one world, then move to another world, returning later to finish a new level in the first world. Developer Atari Games has delivered four new characters in addition to the four in the arcade version. Each character will have unique special attacks. Controller Pak support will allow players to team their evolving characters. Enemies, bosses, power-ups, music and sound effects are all getting radical makeovers. Atari is busily remapping carryover levels and cooking up devious new puzzles and hiding places for items, so don&apos;t even think of cribbing from the coin-op version. Graphical updates include real-time lighting, which is nowhere to be found in the arcade version. The N64 Expansion Pak pushes plenty of polygon-based enemies onto the screen. The essential action -- team up with others, find keys, magic, runes and other items, and beat the stuffing out of anyone in your way -- remains unchanged from the arcade hit. Atari has delivered a far meatier storyline, though, spiffed up by cinema cut-scenes at the successful conclusion of a world.</story>

    <story>Giant Gram 2000- All Japan Pro Wrestling 3 was made by the Sega/WOW developing house in Japan. This title features wrestlers from the All Japan promotion, and also a wide variety of legendary figures. The legends in this game include favorites from both Japan and the U.S., for example- Rikidozan, Bruno Sammartino, and Bruiser Brody are all playable. Only a few wrestlers featured in this game still remain with the All Japan promotion. Giant Gram 2000 really focuses on the sport aspect of professional wrestling. All of the western stuff you would expect to find in a wrestling game, such as- Steel chairs, steel cages, ladders, tables, and all other unnecessary weapons are left out of this release. The game also features an overhauled “burning” fan system. This system let’s the player build up a meter on-screen, that fills up according to all of the reversals and other moves he or she is performing on an opponent. Once the meter is filled the player then enters a “Burning Rage” which allows for the he or she to initiate devastating combos and other moves to defeat opponents.</story>

    <story>Giant Killers is a text-based football management game, and as such the focus of the game is on the statistics and not on the action. Based on the 1999 UK season, the game allows the player to take control of any team in the UK&apos;s Premier league, Divisions One, Two or Three, or the Conference league. The game has three levels of difficulty. In the easy level the player&apos;s club has a wealthy benefactor who makes £25m available, in the medium setting £25m is still available, but two other clubs in the league also receive the same cash injection. In the hard mode there is no extra cash available. Having started the game and selected a team, the player is presented with the game&apos;s main menu. The options here allow the player to access a quick overview of the club&apos;s status, fixtures, results and league tables. The main menu also allows the manager to access the transfer market, where players can be bought and sold, and the manager&apos;s diary, where messages, such as the success or failure of a transfer bid, are received. It is through the manager&apos;s diary that game-time is advanced through to the day of the next match. On match day the player selects their team from the available squad, and decides the formation to be used and tactics - long ball, direct or passing - for the upcoming match. The game offers many standard formations as well as offering the player the chance to create their own. Having decided how the game is to be played, the player starts the match. As this is a management game, there is no game play video to watch; instead the player receives match highlights as though on a teleprompter. At any time during the game the player can pause the match and change the team&apos;s tactics and / or make a substitution. At the end of the match the player can view a range of stats on individual performance e.t.c.The game is entirely mouse controlled, though a keyboard is required when entering names for save games.</story>

    <story>In the World of Giga Wing, many wars have been fought for the divine stone Medallion. Entire civilizations were destroyed in the struggle for gaining control of the legendary item. Now, in the year 2050, four pilots have set off, each carrying a mysterious stone. The stones are said to be the only way to destroy Medallion once and for all. The player can choose to complete the journey for any of the four pilots. Giga Wing is a vertical scrolling shoot &apos;em up. Up to two players must steer their planes around enemy bullets and destroy everything in their path with only a limited amount of lives. When tapping the A button, the main gun is fired. Holding the button activates the Reflect Force. The B button fires a bomb from a limited stock to become temporarily invincible. Power-ups can be collected to increase the bomb and life stock or enhance the main gun&apos;s fire power. Scoring works by using the Reflect Force to repel enemy shots. Once the shots hit an enemy, medals appear in their place. When these are collected, the score multiplier increases. There are two game modes, arcade and score attack. Arcade plays just like the original coin-op game, and score attack lets the player choose a stage and fight for the highest score there. In this mode, the player has unlimited lives, however the score multiplier will reset once the player dies or uses a bomb.</story>

It is a top-down, vertical-scrolling shoot-em-up featuring four-player simultaneous action, high-res 3D graphics, and an orchestral score. There are four characters to choose from, each with his own storyline and fighter/spaceship. Each ship has its own weapon type and speed. Like the previous Giga Wing and Mars Matrix games, gameplay is designed around bullet absorption/reflection mechanics, large numbers of enemies, and giant boss fights. Giga Wing 2 adds the ability to choose from two different bullet reflection powers- reflect force and reflect laser. The reflect force repulses enemy shots, while the reflect laser uses them to charge up a beam weapon.</story>

Any monsters present in these areas will be shown walking around. Walking over to and touching the monster in any way will activate a battle.

Critical Strikes are weaker versions of attack combos with the advantage that they can block an enemy&apos;s action. This partly depends on the positions of the character on the action bar, displayed at the bottom of the screen, which shows each character (and enemy&apos;s) time to act within the battle. Some magic spells and special abilities are also able to block enemy actions, though they take longer to perform than normal attacks. Both combo attacks and critical attacks require the attacker to run up to the enemy in order to perform the action. This depends heavily on the character&apos;s individual movement as well as other characters acting as obstacles on the screen.

    <story>When the humans created artificial beings named gears in 22th century, they didn&apos;t expect that their creation will eventually turn against them. Because gears had no will of their own and could only obey humans. Only one gear, named Justice, was able to transfer his will onto other gears and to rebel against the humans. In year 2180, Justice was killed as a result of a bloody tournament organized by the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. Yet recently, a new gear was discovered. He showed no signs of hostility, yet he had no master and was roaming about free. It was impossible to capture or to kill him because he was immensely strong. Fearing a new Justice will grow out of this gear, the Order organized yet another tournament, this time with a solid prize- five hundred thousand world dollars for the winner. Guilty Gear X is a follow up to Guilty Gear, and is also a 2D fighting game. There are now 16 characters available for you to choose. The battle system became more complicated, thanks to the variety of moves you can perform. Beside special attacks which you can execute if you build up your Tension Gauge by attacking or advancing towards your opponent, there is also a variety of defensing moves to perform. The instant kill moves are back from the previous game.</story>

Gunlord is a mixture of platforming and run &amp; gun gameplay in the spirit of Turrican. This includes exploring large and highly branched levels in search for items, bonus, power-ups and the exit. The game mechanics are very similar, with an assortment of weapons, which can be upgraded by finding power-ups, but only being able to have one main weapon. Gordian is also able to form a ball to move through narrow passages or attack. Additional weapons are a limited amount of smart bombs (huge energy swipes across the screen) and flexible beam, which uses up (self-restoring) energy.</story>

The Anti-Crime Network (ACN) employs bounty hunters known as ‘Headhunters’ to track down the most wanted criminals, using combat skills and high-tech weaponry. You are Jack Wade, an ex-cop turned Headhunter. At the beginning of the game you find yourself strapped to an operating table and manage to escape. After passing out in an alley, you awake in hospital from a coma. With your license revoked and few memories, you are hired by Angela Stern, to find her fathers murderer. Maybe you’ll even find out what happened to yourself if you can stay alive long enough… Headhunter is an action adventure viewed from over the shoulder. In the top right of the screen you have a radar which will track your movements and those of the enemy. Jack has a few moves at his disposal. He can duck and roll, push, pull and climb objects as well as flatten himself up against a wall. Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection. Between levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination. Certain parts of the city are unavailable until you have gained the appropriate Headhunter license. As you have no recollection of your past, you have to take a series of licenses that will grant you access to greater parts of the city, weaponry and gadgets. These are taken in a VR simulator known as the Law Enforcement Intelligence and Licence Approval (LEILA). At various times in the game you will need to go to the LEILA building and upgrade your licence by practising your combat, stealth and driving skills. Jack will need to pass LEILA tests in order to grant him access to the equipment dispensers. He starts the game with a standard issue Stimulator Automatic, but can acquire grenades, proximity mines, neurostunners, decoy shells, shotguns and automatic weapons as he progresses. The weapons in the game fire Electric Neural Projectiles (ENP’s) instead of bullets. These cause brain death so as to preserve the internal organs of the person being shot. Jack also uses a CASIO Visual Manager to keep in touch with Angela and his former chief at the ACN. This is a wristwatch with video capabilities and a direct link to the LEILA database.</story>

At various times in the game you will need to go to the LEILA building and upgrade your licence by practising your combat, stealth and driving skills. Jack will need to pass LEILA tests in order to grant him access to the equipment dispensers. He starts the game with a standard issue Stimulator Automatic, but can acquire grenades, proximity mines, neurostunners, decoy shells, shotguns and automatic weapons as he progresses. The weapons in the game fire Electric Neural Projectiles (ENP’s) instead of bullets. These cause brain death so as to preserve the internal organs of the person being shot. Jack also uses a CASIO Visual Manager to keep in touch with Angela and his former chief at the ACN. This is a wristwatch with video capabilities and a direct link to the LEILA database.</story>

    <story>Based on the Heavy Metal world created by Kevin Eastman and Simon Bisley, this fighting title allows you to take control of a team of three fighters, ranging from a basic all-rounder, or a lightning fast female to a huge bulky mass of power. Of course, they are all a mix of human and humanoid, and depending on their strengths, have a range of different moves and styles. The main aim of the game is to defeat each of the opposing 3-man teams ahead of you, and dominate cyberspace. The game mixes a little of Street Fighter with a dash of Virtual On, allowing you to fight in close or use long range attacks all inside a 3D landscape.</story>

The black side is immune to black enemy bullets which it consider as bonus, and dies on impact with a white enemy bullets. Your own black bullets damages white enemies twice as more as white bullets. And vice-versa for the white side. Those properties makes a balance between protecting yourself well and killing enemies fast.

Robots modeled on the movies&apos; monsters populate each attraction as well, and each is programmed to attack and kill attendees. In addition to the robots, every room in an attraction is fitted with traps to surprise and hurt. If the player character becomes too surprised they&apos;ll die of a heart attack.

The most obvious point is that although most planes come from real World War 2 aircraft, the theatre of operations is a bit unique; The four major sides to the conflict (American, British, German, Japanese) are all fighting one another over a group of islands somewhere in the Pacific. Thus each of these nations is represented in close proximity and in direct conflict to one another. The gameplay takes place over a series of single-player flight missions in which your American pilot will fight against the Axis forces and ally with the British. The majority of the missions take place in the air against other aerial targets.</story>

    <story>Tokyo-to, a city not unlike Tokyo, somewhere in Asia, in the near future. This is the story about the GG&apos;s, one of three rival teenage gangs who ride motorised inline skates and are tagging the streets with graffiti. There is a turf war going on between the gangs GG&apos;s, the Poison Jam, and the high-tech freaks, the Noise Tanks. The evil Rokkaku Corporation has the corrupt police in their grasp, and, headed by Captain Onishima, the cops are hell-bent on subduing the unruly teen protagonists. But there is light in the darkness- the underground DJ, Professor K, and his Jet Set Radio station keep tabs on what is happening on the streets of Tokyo-to, and soon our teens will have something much darker than the police to worry about. As one of the GG&apos;s, you skate through a variety of different levels, from busy streets to run-down rooftops and smelly sewers where you learn new moves, collect spray cans, and tag the streets with graffiti. New graffiti designs can be unlocked by finding Graffiti Souls in levels, by designing new graffiti yourself, or by going online and downloading any images you find while browsing the internet. Fight the rival gangs Poison Jam and the Noise Tanks, the evil mega-corporation Rokkaku and their police cronies in this fresh take on the platform genre, mixing traditional platform elements with skating similar to that of the Tony Hawk&apos;s Pro Skater games. Players are scored on their performance in a level, both on the level of graffiti attempted as well as optional tags and skating tricks. As the game progresses challenge maps open that test the player&apos;s ability to do larger tags, more tricks, or race against an opponent. The American and European release contained two new levels based on New York. The story and order that you meet characters was modified to include these two levels. Both releases also have different unique soundtracks for these levels.</story>

The game is viewed in detailed 3D, allowing you to rotate the table at all angles, either from overhead or using the cue position as a base. Taking a shot involves setting the exact pace and spin of it, and considering what each contact will do to the position of the cue ball, and any balls you may wish to pot afterwards. In the snooker mode playing accurate &apos;safety&apos; shots (to prevent your opponent scoring) becomes important as well). In each mode there are 10 computer opponents, and matches can consist of up to 9 frames. A trick-shot editor is also included, allowing you to practice shots and set up challenges. Replays and an undo mode are also included. Bonus games are included as well - darts, draughts, a fruit machine, and even a remake of Dropzone, a Commodore 64 game from the same programmer.</story>

    <story>The final King of Fighters game released by SNK in its original state, The King of Fighters 2000 expands on the story and gameplay presented in The King of Fighters &apos;99. This year&apos;s tournament is sponsored by the Ikari Warriors in an attempt to discover more about the NESTS organization, and to derail the plans of potential NESTS agents K&apos; and Maxima. Not everything is as straight-forward as it usually is, however, and even the Ikari Warriors themselves are at risk of being betrayed from within by the end of the tournament. The King of Fighters 2000 features a roster of 34 fighters plus 2 unlockable boss characters. The four-man teams and the striker system introduced during the previous year return in this year&apos;s tournament, with the striker system itself receiving significant improvement. One change in particular is the alternate striker system, where every fighter in the game now has another character linked to him or her that may be chosen instead of the normal character for striking purposes. For example, one may elect to use Iori Yagami&apos;s alternate striker instead of using Iori himself; in his case, the player could elect to choose and use his old teammates Mature and Vice for striker duty instead. Some characters also have hidden maniac striker with strange (but potentially useful) abilities.</story>

    <story>In this eighth installment of the King of Fighters series, ten different teams once again battle it out in several countries to decide which team will be this year&apos;s King of Fighters. However, the NESTS organization is once again standing in the participant&apos;s way; they have deployed their own team of four fighters, lead by two individuals of high-rank within NESTS- a man claiming to be the original Zero and Igniz, the CEO of NESTS. The character roster has been updated yet again for this release in the series. Counting the new characters (May Lee, Angel, K9999, Original Zero, Igniz) and returning fighters (such as Heidern and Goro Daimon), The King of Fighters 2001 has 40 normal characters and 2 boss characters to choose from. In terms of gameplay, the system used in The King of Fighters 2000 remains more or less unchanged with the exception of the striker system, which has been redeveloped since that last KOF release. The number of strikers you may have is now fully customizable; you can have as many as 3 characters assigned as strikers and one as a fighter, or assign all 4 of your characters as active fighters. The number of strikers and fighters can be changed after each battle. In addition, the amount of power you can store for special maneuvers and Desperation Moves increases with each character assigned as a striker. A fully active fighting team has only one Power Stock to play with, while a team that is striker-dedicated (save for the single fighter) can access up to four Power Stocks.</story>

    <story>The second plotless dream match in The King of Fighters series, this game sports 39 normal characters and 5 hidden characters, some of whom haven&apos;t appeared since KOF98. The King of Fighters 2002 also has five characters exclusive to the X-Box, the PS2 and/or Dreamcast systems- Shingo Yabuki, King, Geese Howard, Riot of the Blood Iori and Leopold Goenitz. Shingo and King are available on all the non-Neo Geo systems, while Geese and the rest are only available on the PS2 and X-Box platforms. The gameplay system has also changed. The striker system and four-character teams found in the last three KOF releases have been totally removed. In their place are the old-school three man teams and the Advanced system from The King of Fighters &apos;97 and The King of Fighters &apos;98.</story>

    <story>Wicked Jester, a band of four, are headed for a Friday night gig at The Coventry, a rundown dive outside of town. They arrive only to find the parking lot deserted, the club seemingly dead. The band&apos;s members- Pablo Ramirez, Andy Chang, Gabriel Gordo and Patrick Scott, stepping from their van, are startled by a voice from the shadows. She offers them four tickets to a circus -- tonight&apos;s the grand finale! Having nothing better to do, the four accept and the nightmare begins. Based on characters from comic book author Todd McFarlane, KISS Psycho Circus- The Nightmare Child brings the horror and carnage of the Psycho Circus to the PC in a shooter format. There are two-dozen creatures to battle with and three classes of weapons to use, each with four specific types- melee (beast claws, thornblade, twister and punisher), common (zero cannon, magma cannon, windblade and scourge) and ultimate (stargaze, galaxion, spirit lance and draco). In addition to the weaponry, temporary power-ups and instant items such as health, attack and defense powers are available.</story>

    <story>Lack of Love (or L.O.L.) is an adventure / RPG hybrid based on the evolution of an alien being. In the beginning you are just born, but the alien world is harsh, and so you constantly have to improve yourself, learn new things and avoid being eaten by other animals. And to make your new life even harder, an alien robot race just discovered the planet and starts colonizing it. Surviving is obviously not easy... The game is played from an isometric perspective in front of detailed prerendered backgrounds. As you are an animal the game doesn&apos;t have any ingame texts - for solving riddles you are totally dependent on experimentation and careful observation of the environment. To reach the next state of evolution you will also need to help other beings - as a reward they will give you energy balls or new abilities required for further progress. Besides the usual actions like attacking / biting and talking (or better communicating) you have somewhat strange actions sleeping and urinating which are essential to the gameplay.</story>

    <story>1500 years after Blood Omen- Legacy of Kain, the vampire Kain&apos;s decision at the end of that game has finally defeated the human kingdoms and brought the world of Nosgoth under his control. Ruling from a castle built on the Pillars of Nosgoth, Kain has established an empire of six vampire clans, each ruled by a lieutenant, the sons of Kain. Raziel was one such lieutenant, but lost his position through the insolence of receiving a new evolutionary dark gift, the growth of feathery wings, before his master had acquired it. Fearing that Raziel might one day surpass him, Kain tears off Raziel&apos;s wings in a fit of range and banishes him into the Abyss. There, Raziel is lost in time, died and his body consumed. The Elder God recovers Raziel&apos;s soul and rebuilds the broken body, not as a living vampire, but as a strange new creature of the underworld. Swearing revenge on Kain, Raziel now phases seamlessly between Nosgoth and it&apos;s underworld, using his new powers to become a terrible reaver of souls... Soul Reaver is a 3rd person action-adventure title that follows Raziel on his quest to purge the land of vampires and take revenge on Kain and his brothers, leaders of the six clans. The player controls the game from behind Raziel&apos;s shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel&apos;s can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. Raziel can shift through the material world into the spectral realm at will... but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel&apos;s life energy at a constant rate. Throughout the game, energy is recovered by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. If Raziel is able to defeat one of his brothers, he will additionally gain a new ability (dark gift) upon drinking it&apos;s soul. Examples include- the ability to swim, file telekinetic projectiles or the ability to phase through locked gates. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of weapons including spears, daggers, swords, axes, as well as attacking enemies barehanded. Eventually, Raziel will also come across Kain&apos;s personal sword (named the Soul Reaver), and will use it to create a powerful energy blade weapon. The world is left open to Raziel, he can return to areas previously completed and explore the world of Nosgoth at will. Access to certain areas however sometimes requires the use of gained specific abilities. Many of the puzzles the player will need to solve in this quest are block puzzles, requiring the placement of certain large structures (usually square blocks), either to activate switches or to build access to out-of-reach areas.</story>

    <story>Marvel vs. Capcom- Clash of Super Heroes is a 2D fighting game that combines characters from Capcom&apos;s videogames with characters from the Marvel comic universe, similar to Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter. The game takes place in a Marvel universe where Professor Charles Xavier asks the heroes to help him before he merges with the consciousness of Magneto to form the being known as Onslaught, the final boss. The game follows the standard fighting gameplay, but different from X-Men vs. Street Fighter you now have to make up a squad of three characters instead of two. The other characters can be summoned for assist attacks and there is also a duo team attack to control two characters for a brief time, along with the ability to perform super moves where the characters team up. Options include a straight arcade battle, 4-player tag modes (Dreamcast version only), a survival mode (much like Street Fighter Alpha 3) and a training mode. The PlayStation version does not have the 4-player tag mode and also reduces the second character to an assist role, but in addition introduces a crossover mode where tag-team play with identical teams is possible. For Marvel the cast of playable characters includes Spider Man, Captain America, Venom, Hulk, Gambit, War Machine, Wolverine, Gold War Machine (secret character), Hyper Venom (secret character), Orange Hulk (secret character) and Onslaught (secret character). The Capcom side offers Chun-Li, Ryu, Zangief, Morrigan Aensland, Captain Commando, Megaman (Rockman in Asia), Strider Hiryu, Jin Saotome, Roll (secret character), Lilith-Mode Morrigan (secret character) and Shadow Lady (secret character). There is also a large number of special partners that can be summoned.</story>

The story takes place on the prison planet Alpha Prime, a world completely designed for the holding of criminals. You are a synthetic lifeform sentenced for an eternity for a crime you didn&apos;t commit and in order to earn your freedom, you must compete against other prisoners in competitions in 10 different incarceration facilities. To compete in these competitions however, you must undergo a procedure that removes your legs and replaces it with a rolling sphere. There are seven different events to compete in which are Pursuit, Last Man Rolling, Race, King of the Hill, Run the Gauntlet, Tag, and Powerball that pit you not only against your fellow inmates and guards, but against the levels themselves. Run the gauntlet charges you with making it to a goal point within a time limit, all the while avoiding other warriors and obstacles such as flame throwers, spikes, and gun turrets. Pursuit is identical, but it adds the challenge of the arena crumbling away. Powerball has you collecting balls throughout the arena and throwing them at a goalpost before time runs out. Tag has you collecting a set number of tokens that have been scattered throughout the arena within a set time limit.</story>

    <story>Don&apos;t be put off by the pretty awful cover, Musapey&apos;s Choco Maker is actually a pretty addictive puzzler coming to beloved Dreamcast straight from the Naomi arcade original. Musapey&apos;s is probably best described as a marsupial like creature. In a typical one-player game your marsupial is dropped onto the playing field, a collection of various colored cubes with a special cube called &apos;&apos;boss&apos;&apos; at the center of the mess. Your creature freely walks six sides of the playfield using a block it stands upon (you lay these blocks down with a press of a button) eliminating other blocks/rows to clear the playfield leaving only the boss block remaining. A time limit adds another layer of challenge. Eliminating blocks is simple, it&apos;s akin to a sandwich, say you have a yellow block, plop a red block at one end of the block and do the same at the other end (R,Y,R), the entire row will disappear. In addition any loose blocks hanging on that row will disappear as well. These extra blocks will add a few seconds back to the clock, quite handy. The game doesn&apos;t dictate the length of a row but the more blocks you eliminate the more your bomb gauge fills which yields a block that wipes out blocks in a set radius. Using gravity to take out multiple rows and gray blocks that have to transformed to be removed add another facet to the gameplay, elevating the simple premise into a deep game.</story>

    <story>Although being another tennis title for the Dreamcast, Net De Tennis differs to Sega’s Virtua or Power Smash Tennis series, not just visually but also in the way it plays. Unlike Sega&apos;s title, there is not so much focus on reaction and speed in Net De Tennis. Instead the crux of the gameplay is based on strategy and the ability to outwit your opponent and while it makes the game feel more realistic than its graphics initially lets on, it also takes away a little of the arcade fun. The speed also can feel a little bit sluggish at time, so set up plays feel infinitely more considered. Controls are tight, with just one button for a lob shot and another for regular shot but each shot can be swerved depending on how you move the control, essentially give you a more deeper control system than at first meets the eye.</story>

    <story>You are the Nomad Soul, a computer game player sucked into another dimension. At first you take on the role of Kay&apos;l, an Omikron police officer. As Kay&apos;l you must figure out what has happened over the past few days due to memory loss. As the game progresses you will find a plot that twists and turns at every corner. For transportation, you use a Slider that you can control manually or set to auto-pilot to take you throughout much of Omikron. When given a choice of what to say to a person, your answers will almost always affect your future in the game and how people act towards you. Throughout the course of the game you may take on the role of up to 41 different characters through the use of a Soul Transfer spell. In most situations, even if you die, you will be virtually reincarnated through the next character that touches you. In your travels you must explore the vast city of Omikron. You may visit anywhere in the city that you wish to, even if it isn&apos;t important for finishing the game. An example of this freedom is when in the red light district of Omikron, you find a flyer about a prohibited concert that you may attend. If you go to the concert, the band will play a full length song for you. Also in this part of Omikron you can attend peep-shows and go visit the sex shops. All items are kept inside your SNEAK device on your wrist, 18 items may be carried at once and there is a transfer system set up so items can be stored and retrived at another station. Also, in Omikron, it is important that with each character you take them through combat training so you are at a higher fighting level. Although most of the game takes place in adventure mode there are two other modes available to use at certain points throughtout the game, shooting and fighting. In the fighting mode, your character knows a variety of moves and will have to fight off his opposition. In the shooting mode, you find yourself in a first-person perspective shooting after thugs mostly, although you will run into some more interesting enemies to shoot later in the game. As they say in Omikron, Who will you be after you die?</story>

Your goal is to defend against terrorist attacks. You can select one of four predefined players, which differ in speed, armor and weapons, or you can create a customized character. The game itself doesn&apos;t provide any storyline, instead you can choose one of the three modes- Arcade, Mission or Versus. In all modes you find yourself in one of several small arenas after starting the game. Usually your goal is to kill a certain amount of terrorists in a limited time (or your friends in Versus mode). The gameplay is similar to Quake 3 Arena, especially in regards to game speed and the (configurable) key assignment of the controller.</story>

The game features 22 anime-like Characters in a 3-dimensional futuristic world - except for the backgrounds and the menus, which are plain 2D-bitmaps without a lot of movement. The stages are unlimited in all directions, so it&apos;s not possible to fall of the edge. The speciality of this game are the so called plasma moves, visually very appealing special moves filling the complete screen which can be executed when you have collected enough plasma power. Despite of the 22 characters there are only 11 different move layouts, as one layout is shared by two characters.</story>

If that wasn&apos;t enough to worry about you also have to remember that your balls will change colour once a combination has been preformed. Of course the colour changing is always the same such as a red ball will change to a green ball and so on.</story>

The friendly family meeting soon turns into a nightmare- Assan kills the young Prince&apos;s bodyguards, locks him up in a prison, and captures the Sultan. The reason is a little disagreement between the brothers regarding matrimonial arrangements- it appears that the Sultan had promised his daughter to Assan&apos;s son, Rugnor, and later broke his promise by letting her marry the Prince. In the resulting turmoil, the Sultan is killed, and the Princess is kidnapped by Rugnor, a ruthless half-tiger creature. The Prince must figure out a way to find Rugnor, defeat him, and rescue his wife. Prince of Persia 3D is just what its title implies- an action platformer with puzzle-solving elements in the style of the previous Prince of Persia games, but set in a three-dimensional environment. The Prince still has to time his jumps, avoid deadly traps, interact with the environment, and fight Rugnor&apos;s minions who will try to stop him.</story>

    <story>Psychic Force 2012, the sequel to Psychic Force, is a one-on-one fighting game with a twist. The matches take place inside a giant floating cube. You are able to fly, using your psychic abilities, around a 3D arena with six walls. Each of the ten available characters, Might, Regina, Wendy, Emilio, Setsuna, Patty, Gudeath, Genshin, Carlo, and Gates, are controlled with three buttons- guard, weak attack and strong attack. The effect varies with the distance. Next to the regular life meter, there is also a power meter. By using special moves, the meter is drained and your moves are limited. It is possible to recharge, and the capacity of the power meter expands when you lose a lot of health. Additionally, each fighter has its own unique moves, energy attacks and a weapon, which they use, mid-flight, to pummel their opponent. There are three main game modes- training, versus and a story mode using static anime-inspired images and in-engine cut scenes to tell the story. The story centers around two groups of psychics with differing ideals about co-existence with humans. In the middle of this are several neutral psychics with ties to members in either group. The later PlayStation port, renamed to Psychic Force 2, adds the 3 missing characters from the first game (Genma, Brad and Sonia), the psy-expand mode where the player can play a series of special battles to learn other character attacks, and an anime intro video replacing the original in-game intro. It also lowers the overall difficulty of the CPU fighters and makes some control adjustments (for instance the shield can now optionally be enabled with a single button). Of course, the graphics were notably degraded.</story>

    <story>Psyvariar 2 is another specimen of the recent breed of newschool arcade shoot&apos;em&apos;ups (other examples being Ikaruga and Border Down). As many other recently released shoot&apos;em&apos;ups, it combines basic arcade shooter gameplay with modern 3D graphics to liven up the genre. The level backgrounds as well as all enemies are modeled in full 3D, with the action taking place in a vertically scrolling two-dimensional plane which moves through the level. As most of the other new-style SHMUPs, Psyvariar 2 has a gimmick- getting close to enemies or shots without actually being hit is called buzzing and yields massive extra score. In addition, the player ship&apos;s rate of fire is rather slow by default and can be raised by shaking the ship left and right a few times and then keeping moving horizontally - as soon as the horizontal movement stops, the fire rate drops down to normal again. As in most other of the new Japanese style of shoot&apos;em&apos;ups, there are usually an extremely high number of enemy shots on the screen. All these factors combine to make learning precise control a central part of the game.</story>

    <story>The third game in the Quake series is a departure from the previous games, focusing exclusively on multiplayer arena fighting with no story-driven singleplayer part - directly competing with Epic Games that did the same with the contemporary Unreal Tournament. The offline part takes the player through a number of one-on-one and team-based challenges against AI-controlled opponents, slowly ranking upwards in difficulty, as the character of the player&apos;s choosing. Compared to the previous titles, the colours and general design of the game are much brighter and it shakes off the dominant shades of brown and grey the previous titles in the series were known for. The player&apos;s arsenal consists of new and familiar, but redesigned weapons, including a gauntlet (melee attacks) and a machine gun as the spawn weapons, a shotgun, plasma gun, lightning gun, rocket launcher, railgun and BFG. Each weapon has specific advantages, ranging from the amount of damage to reloading times and the ability to hit-scan opponents. The different arenas are also filled with health bubbles, complete sets of armour and armour shards, the well-known Quad Damage power-up, ammunition, and specials such as Mega Health, Haste, Invisibility, a powerful Battlesuit, and more. As with the other Quake games, it is known for its freedom in movement. Advanced players using techniques such as rocket jumping, strafing and circle jumping to quickly get around areas. The game offers more speed than Quake 2, but it is not as fast as the original Quake. Not everything was kept - the double jumping from the previous titles was removed for instance, but replaced with new tricks. The singleplayer part only serves as a diversion for the online multiplayer options, with modes such as duel, team deathmatch (TDM), capture the flag (CTF) and more. As with Quake II, the vanilla version of the game was eventually heavily tweaked by the players&apos; community with all-new tournament features (including voting, referees, banning, netcode updates), as it was used in professional Pro Gaming tournaments for almost ten years.</story>

    <story>Radirgy is a vertical-screen top-down bullet-hell shooter originally developed by Milestone for Naomi arcade system and later released on Dreamcast. Setting itself apart from many other top-down shooters on the system, the game features bright, cartoony, cell-shaded graphics. At the beginning, the player is given a choice of three different mecha-ships - one with a spread-gun, a weak homing laser, or a slow but powerful bubble gun. Additionally, each ship can use a sword for anything that gets too close, or specific enemies which can&apos;t be killed otherwise, a shield, which appears at the front of the ship once the player lets go of the fire button, and a smart-bomb-like field that can be extended around the player in a small circle, damaging enemies, absorbing their shots and turning them into points.</story>

    <story>Another shooter in the Cotton saga. Trouble brews in the homeland of Cotton&apos;s long time friend Silk, as the evil demon Suede steals the legendary Willow candy from the queen&apos;s castle. Seeing as how no one can face Suede and his forces Silk drafts Cotton in order to restore peace to her land, but she may have forgotten that Cotton is a big fan of Willow candies herself... Gameplay-wise Rainbow Cotton actually follows in the steps of Panorama Cotton as the gameplay switches from a 2D perspective to a 3rd person one. The gameplay itself however is reminiscent of games like Panzer Dragoon, in which you don&apos;t control Cotton as she flies, but instead where she aims with her magic spells. You can shoot down enemies as well as open chests, doors and other bonus locations for power-ups and spells, which advance Cotton&apos;s abilities in an rpg-lite fashion and increase your arsenal with different magical powers. Taking advantage of the technological advances, the game uses for the first time polygonal graphics and to complement the action the game features 2D animated cutscenes between levels.</story>

A crazed giant robot has kidnapped your skating buddies. By completing skating challenges at the robot&apos;s sky fortress, you must rescue your friends. You skate around 3 large areas and attempt to perform wild tricks, collect scooter wheels, and earn bonus time. By completing an objective on all 3 areas, you unlock a sky fortress level in which you can rescue a new skater to control. Gameplay is based heavily on the Tony Hawk series of games. Tricks consist of button and direction presses, and can be strung together with grinds to create high-scoring combos.</story>

    <story>For years, the Toy-Volt company has been producing toys and games for children all over the world. Within months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt shot to the top! No one could put their finger on exactly what it was that made the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in the world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost.... magic. Now, their newest R/C cars really start to live! Re-Volt is a racing game where you take control over one of more than 28 R/C cars and drive on one of the 13 tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a reversed (backwards) or mirror (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from. There are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There&apos;s a Single Race, where you complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where you try to complete a series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you play with live opponents. There&apos;s also a Time Trial, where you&apos;re alone on the track, and simply try to get as best a time as possible; a Practice mode, where you&apos;re free to drive around a track to learn its structure and shortcuts; and the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect stars situated in hard-to-reach places. In Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which makes your car shock opponents nearby to make them stop.</story>

    <story>Reel Fishing- Wild is a Dreamcast-exclusive entry in the fishing simulation series. It allows players to catch two dozen species of fish in 14 different locations all over the world, from Japan to North and South America to Oceania. The Dreamcast fishing rod controller is supported for realistic castings and reel-ins. The game starts in the fishing lodge, where players can check out a fish glossary, their catch list and their stock of lures, reels and lines and rods. Going for a round of fishing is done via the fishing notebook, which presents players with a series of challenges. At the start, only one location - a Japanese mountain stream - is unlocked. To unlock others, a certain number of a particular species must be caught. Catching fish not only opens up new locations, but also gives access to new types of lures, reels and lines, and rods, which in turn allow more successful fishing. A fishing session begins with a photo-realistic first-person view of the location created through combining digitized images with some animation, like for a waterfall or swaying trees, as well as disturbances of the water surface that hint at the best places for casting. Once the line is cast and a fish moves near the lure, the view switches to a 3D underwater view, showing fish, line, and hook in close-up. Baiting, setting the hook, and reeling in the catch are then done in this view.</story>

Just like the original Resident Evil, players can choose to play as one of two possible characters.

Leon will team up with a mysterious woman calling herself Ada Wong, while Claire will find herself charged with protecting a little girl named Sherry Birkin. Unlike the original Resident Evil, beating the game for the first time unlocks a second scenario to be played with the character you didn&apos;t choose, with new locations, maps, enemies, a longer and more climactic ending. Your actions in the first scenario can also affect the outcome of certain events in the second scenario. Additionally ammo and healing items are more plentiful than in the original game, although you still aren&apos;t given enough bullets to kill every enemy you meet.</story>

    <story>So Evil they even gave it a subtitle! The final installment of the Resident Evil series for the Playstation, Resident Evil 3 takes place during the events of Resident Evil 2. The midwestern town of Raccoon City is in ruins, having been overrun with the undead creating T-virus thanks to the wacky hijinks of William Birkin and Umbrella Inc. As Jill master of unlocking Valentine (one of the two main protagonists of the original Resident Evil), you must find a way out of the zombie-infested remains of the city alive. Along the way, you&apos;ll interact with and receive help from three heavily armed Umbrella mercenaries who have also become stranded in Raccoon City thanks to the incompetence of their employer. Standing in the way of your group&apos;s last escape are a horde of flesh-eating zombified citizens, homicidal mutants, and a relentless killing machine known only as Nemesis who is determined to hunt down and kill the survivors of the original Resident Evil, including Jill. A dramatic improvement over Tyrant/Mr. X/G from the previous games, Nemesis possesses the same maneuverability as Jill allowing him to run (faster than you, in fact), use firearms (such as a rocket launcher), dodge attacks, and even move through doors and from room to room in pursuit of Jill. On top of that he still possesses the nigh indestructibility we&apos;ve come to know and... well, know from Umbrella&apos;s ultimate bio-weapons. Like its two predecessors Resident Evil 3 is a third-person action-adventure game with polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds with cinematic camera angles, a technique originally pioneered by Alone in the Dark. Although the game uses the same basic engine and gameplay as the previous games, improvements include auto-targeting, a 180 degree spin, and a new dodge move that allows you to avoid enemy attacks by pressing a button a second before they strike. Another addition is Jill&apos;s ability to create different kinds of ammunition by mixing together three different types of gunpowder found throughout the game. Compared to Resident Evil 2, the amount of available ammunition and healing items has been significantly decreased, making the game more difficult. The variety of zombie citizens has also been made more diverse. The number of polygons in the character models has also been increased, along with the possible screen resolution and color depth for the PC version (up to 1600 X 1200 at 32 bits, from a maximum of 640 X 480 at 16 bits for Resident Evil 2). Another welcome addition in the PC version is the ability to skip cutscenes as well as the door loading animation. The PC and Dreamcast versions includes all eight of Jill&apos;s possible costumes, as well as the mercenary mini-game Operation Mad Jackal which allows you to play as one of the three Umbrella soldiers. On the Playstation version, these special features must be unlocked by beating the game with a high score.</story>

She infiltrates Umbrella Corporation&apos;s headquarters in Paris, where she is captured and knocked out. When she comes to, she finds herself in a prison on a remote island. Freed by a friendly guard, Claire faces several problems. Not only is the island under attack by an unknown assailant, but there has been another outbreak of the T-Virus and the island is crawling with zombies and other mutated creatures. Claire not only has to face the undead, but also the commander of the base, a mad aristocrat with family ties to the origins of Umbrella Corporation and the T-Virus. And escaping from the island is only the beginning of Claire&apos;s ordeals. Code- Veronica continues the survival horror gameplay of its predecessors- the protagonist explores the surroundings, fighting monsters and solving puzzles. However, Code- Veronica is the first game in the series to do away with pre-rendered backgrounds, using a fully polygonal 3D engine instead, which allows for features such as real-time lighting and camera movement. Still, such movements are only used sparingly, and the use of perspective is mostly unchanged from earlier installments- the camera automatically switches to different static angles, showing protagonist, monsters and rooms from different spooky viewpoints. Most of the weapons from the earlier games make return appearances- knife, handguns, shotgun, grenade launcher and crossbow are all featured. There are also new weapons including a sniper rifle, an AK-47 and several guns only found in pairs, which can be used to target two enemies at the same time. Several weapons upgrades can also be found. Similar to the earlier games, the player will not only control Claire, but also two other characters- Claire&apos;s fellow prisoner Steve, and her brother Chris.</story>

    <story>Roadsters is a car racing game that features both licensed cars from manufacturers like Mitsubishi, Alfa Romeo, Lotus, etc., and unlicensed cars from imaginary manufacturers that are based and bare great resemblance to their equivalent, real car models. The game has 8 racers and 34 cars from which you can choose from and 4 modes in total- 1. Roadster Trophy – The player starts by selecting one of the available racers and is given a sum of money that must be used to acquire a car. There are 3 divisions in which the player can compete on with the 3rd being of the easiest difficulty and requiring less money to participate; the 1st being the most difficult one and needing a higher amount of money in order to participate. More money can be earned by winning the races and that in turn allows to buy new cars or upgrade the ones that are already in possession. Multi-Player – Multi-player mode supports up to 2 human players that can compete in any of the available circuits with 4 more CPU controlled racers. The mode allows for either vertical or horizontal split screen. Quick Race – In Quick Race the player can select the racer, car, circuit and weather conditions, and race against 7 more CPU controlled players. Time Trial – Like Quick Race mode, the player can also select here the racer, car, circuit and weather conditions but without the competition of the other modes, the player races against time for as many laps as the player wants.</story>

    <story>Samba De Amigo is a highly unique game- a maracas simulation. Game play is based around a special maracas controller that you use to interact with the music. The controller senses which region in space out of a possible 6 that the maracas are in. It also senses when the player shakes the maracas. As the music plays, the player must shake the maracas in the appropriate region with proper timing to progress. A standard controller can also be used if you do not have the maracas controller, which is sold separately. The music in the game comes from a wide variety of sources. Some of the songs are traditional samba music, while others are recognizable pop tunes, like Macarena and Tequila.</story>

    <story>This game is the update to the original, maraca shaking, Samba de Amigo. However, a lot more has been added than in most updates. A new hustle mode of play complements the original mode and the song list has almost been doubled, with many new songs such as Vamos de Carnaval, the theme from Rocky and even the Wedding March being included. For anyone who thought they had the original game mastered, there&apos;s even a survival mode where you have to play through all 43 songs making a maximum of 8 mistakes in total. The core gameplay effectively remains the same as the original though. This game was only released in Japan.</story>

    <story>SEGA Bass Fishing 2 is the obvious sequel to SEGA Bass Fishing. Like the previous game in the series this simulation game allows the player to fish for bass on various lakes. At the start of the game the player can pick one of various characters. Each character has his or her own stats such as casting distance, which makes them all unique. Each character&apos;s appearance can be altered by the player as well. Using sonar the player can cruise around the lake until he find a good fishing spot. Besides the location the player can also pick the month, time of day and weather in which he wants to fish. All these factors are calculated when it comes to determining what kind of fish he or she is likely to catch. To aid the player there&apos;s 100 different kinds of lures to fish with. The game is meant to be played with the special fishing rod controller. There are two game modes- free fishing and tournament mode. In the first you can do what you wish and try to improve on your own records. In the latter mode you have to compete against NPCs or another player. There are various tiers of difficulty.</story>

    <story>Sega Rally 2 is the sequel to Sega&apos;s hit arcade game, Sega Rally. This game, like it&apos;s predecessor, is based on Rally racing. Rally racing is unique in that races take place on both race tracks and off-road courses. The courses in this game reflect this nicely. Some take place in the desert or forest, others take place in cities. The cars in this game are all actual rally cars, with manufacturers from Europe and Japan both well represented. You do not get to see very many of them at one time, however, since rally races are typically time-based events. In this game, you are not competing directly against the other cars, you simply have to have the best time through the course. So, during any race you will usually see a handful of other cars on the track. Sega Rally 2 contains several modes of play. The first mode is the simple arcade mode of play. Here, you race in 4 courses, one right after another. The second mode is the 10 year championship. In this mode you race on 16 courses, and can make modifications to your car between races. Finally, there is a 2-person split screen mode for head-to-head competition.</story>

These games are Altered Beast, Columns, Golden Axe, Phantasy Star II, Shining Force, Vectorman, Revenge of Shinobi, Sonic the Hedgehog, Streets of Rage 2 and Wrestle War. This was the first American release of Wrestle War.

    <story>In an interesting publicity maneuver for their newly-released Dreamcast video game system, Sega of America released a free game for the PC and DC platforms, Sega Swirl. (Also apparently to capitalize on the DC&apos;s logo, a Cinnabon-like swirl.) The object of the game is simple. A screen fills with multi-colored swirls, and then you must remove the whole screen. A swirl removed will also remove all neighboring swirls of the same color. Gravity affects the remaining swirls, and the whole mass contracts to the left of the screen as you remove more and more. Scoring is based on combos, or number of swirls removed simultaneously. Obviously, more swirls=higher points, but single swirls actually remove points. You have to play a balancing act between removing huge masses of swirls and being left with non-matching sets, or removing smaller sets and possibly missing out on a huge combo score. In a foreshadowing of the (hoped for) coming day of PC/video game on-line convergence, PC and DC owners can play against each other- via e-mail. PC owners can download the game for free, and Sega offers it in two varieties- the standard version, and (refreshingly) a small sound-free version for people who don&apos;t want to be online for a long time. A separate soundpack is available for those who opt to not get the whole set in one fell swoop. DC owners can get the game free on various promo GD-ROMs Sega has distributed.</story>

    <story>Sega Tetris is an officially licensed Tetris game originally made for arcades that can be played in both single player and multi player modes. The game uses polygonal graphics with animated backgrounds. As progress through the game is made these change and take the player to numerous different settings. When playing alone the game is very much true to the original Tetris but with some differences. The game is played with a joystick for moving the blocks around as they fall and two buttons to rotate them left and right. As the game&apos;s level is raised the speed of the falling block will also increase and since it&apos;s an arcade game it will reach a high pace relatively early. One addition to the game is a slot machine and the symbol it stops on depends on the number of lines cleared. By matching all the three wheels the player will get a large bonus. The two player versus mode adds special attacks to the gameplay and these are activated by clearing lines. Clearing two lines will lead to a joint attack where two stuck together blocks will fall while clearing three lines will lead to a long block falling. By creating a tetris (clearing four lines) stacked lines will rise from the bottom of the playfield. Some attacks come from clearing multiple lines that are apart from each other. This includes a missile attack that destroys block and a K.O. attack that knocks out the opponent preventing him from controlling the blocks for a short while. There is also a four player mode where two cabinets are connected. On the Dreamcast version the multiplayer mode can be played online.</story>

Ryu attempts to stop Lan Di, but is effortlessly beaten to within an inch of his life. After recovering from his injuries Ryu sets out to track down his father&apos;s murder as well as uncover his family&apos;s secrets and the mystery of the Phoenix and Dragon mirrors that Lan Di seeks. Much of Shenmue&apos;s gameplay involves talking to Ryu&apos;s friends and the various people around town, hoping to find hints or clues that lead to the next step in the story. Any details Ryu learns are written down in his notebook for future review. Ryu can buy items from stores or try his luck with capsule toy machines, but the vast majority of items you can buy have no purpose outside of filling out your inventory screen. Ryu can also visit an arcade and play arcade accurate versions of Hang-On and Space Harrier as well as games like darts and pool. Ryu is a trained martial artist, and while a true martial artist knows it is better to avoid a fight, sometimes it is still necessary. Ryu can train his moves, either by repeatedly doing them while training, or by sparing with his friend Fuku-san. Fighting plays like a simplified Virtua Fighter game, although with toned down air juggling. Ryu&apos;s training also gives him heightened reflexes, and sometimes during a cutscene the player will have only a moment to press a button (displayed onscreen) to get Ryu out of danger. Failing an input prompt is not always fatal, but whether Ryu survives or not depends on the danger he was in. Included with the game is the Shenmue Passport disc. On this disc players can receive tutorials about various aspects of the game like minigames or the battle system, watch cutscenes they&apos;ve already seen in the game, and listen to music from the game. This disc also includes the option to go online to a special site where players can review world-wide minigame rankings, get hints for the game from Nozomi, review game maps of Yokosuka, trade uncommon items found in the game for even rarer items only available on the passport, and visit the official homepage.

    <story>Shenmue 2 is the sequel to the innovative free-roaming RPG Shenmue. Continuing on exactly from where the original left off, Shenmue 2 furthers the story of Ryo Hazuki and his search for his fathers murderer, Lan-Di, as well as the events surrounding the murder. Taking place in China, Shenmue 2 contains a real world gameplay system first seen in the original Shenmue. This puts you in a world where hundreds of people live out their daily lives around you, day turns to evening and on into night. It rains and snows, you can get part time jobs to earn extra money for rent or even gamble or play real classic arcade games like Outrun at the local video arcade all within a living breathing city. There is also a battle mode for those occasions when Ryo gets himself into fights as well as quick time events that require you to act quickly in the heat of some tense situations. The Xbox version of the game came with an additional DVD called Shenmue- The Movie, which contained a summation of the first Shenmue game made into a feature length movie. This was to help people who didn&apos;t own a Dreamcast understand the plot from the previous game, since it was never released for the Xbox.</story>

The player takes the role of John Mullins, a US mercenary working for an organization known as The Shop. The goal is simple- hunt the villains across the globe, thwart their evil plans, and save the world! Like most 3D shooters, Soldier of Fortune consists mainly of exploring the environments and killing the enemies that try to impede the player&apos;s progress. It is one of the first shooters to isolate over 20 different body regions and show/inflict damage to those regions. For example, if the player character shoots an enemy in the foot, the enemy will limp. The game was also notable for including realistic gore animations resulting from the injuries sustained by the enemies.</story>

This time he plans to exploit the power of Chaos, a malevolent being that feeds upon the power of the Chaos Emeralds. In their own ways five heroes will do what they can to save Station Square and, perhaps, the entire world. The player can select from which character to play after meeting them with Sonic, and each has their own unique version of each level. Sonic&apos;s levels involve racing through a level as quickly as possible, destroying any robots along the way. Tails can hover over distances, and his levels are similar to Sonic&apos;s except that he must beat an opponent to the finish line. Amy can&apos;t charge up ramps or run as quickly as Sonic and Tails, but she does have a giant hammer she can break obstacles with. The goal of her levels is to avoid being captured by a robot sent after her by Dr. Robotnik. E102 Gamma is a slow, difficult to maneuver robot, but it has guns and missiles that can lock on to several targets at once, chaining together attacks and earning a higher score and more time on the clock. The goal of its levels is to reach a boss enemy and destroy it before time runs out. The final character is Big the Cat, a fisherman searching for his lost frog. Big&apos;s levels are almost entirely devoid of action or fighting; he just fishes. Each character can find items that increase their abilities as the story progresses, such as a ring for Sonic that lets him home along lines of rings, or improved lures for Big. A final chapter wrapping up the story is unlocked after all other characters have been completed. Additionally each of the characters can visit the Chao garden where they can raise baby Chaos. By petting, feeding, and showing animals found in levels to the Chaos they can grow stronger, and optionally be put into races against other Chaos. As well each level in the game has additional objectives that can be completed to acquire extra emblems, although the emblems don&apos;t do anything in this version of the game. Finally at one time it was possible to go online and download additional levels and bonuses in the game, such a Christmas theme for Station Square and a level sponsored by AT&amp;amp;T, but since SegaNet shut down this is no longer possible.</story>

    <story>Much like Mario Party and Crash Bash, Sonic Shuffle has Sonic and his team playing a board game style tournament, where mini-games are at every turn. Each character has a group of cards with a number on each. On every turn the player chooses a card to determine how many steps to take. When all of the cards have been used the deck is reshuffled, and each player gets a new hand. While a player can see only the numbers on their own cards, and not the numbers on other players&apos; cards, they can still choose the cards of another player. Each board has certain tiles- blue adds 3 rings to your total; red removes 3 rings from your total and special tiles which places all of the players into a min-game or event. The aim of the game, at the end of it all, is to get the Precioustone (1 per board).</story>

A sequel to Soul Blade, Soul Calibur takes place in a time inspired by a mixture of 16th-century ancient China and oriental medieval fantasies and legends. All characters have weapons and distinct fighting styles with over 100 individual moves per character. In addition to high, mid, and low attacks, characters can hold/throw, block, and perform special attacks -- one or more of which is deemed un-blockable and must be avoided by ducking, jumping, or rotating around your attacker. In addition to several locales in which to fight and alternate models/costumes per character, the Dreamcast conversion of Soul Calibur contains many additional features over the arcade coin-op, including hidden characters and locales, a campaign mode, and tournament mode. There is also a museum where you can view character profiles and view motion-captured martial arts demonstrations.</story>

    <story>Pick the warrior, thief, or wizard, and fight through five huge levels, each with its own boss. Your main weapons are your fists, but you can pull out weapons for quick kills. You only get so many shots with your weapon before it breaks, though. Gameplay is basic 3D brawling. You will be attacked by one or more enemies, and will need to defend yourself, and attack back. The game features arcade and adventure modes. In the arcade mode, the levels are timed, and you only get 5 lives but you are revived where you died. In adventure mode, you get unlimited retries of each level, but must complete each level on a single life. Note that your objective in each level is to kill every enemy; since the levels have multiple paths, you will need to backtrack often.</story>

    <story>Omega Squad is the only game in the Spec Ops series released on the Dreamcast. Players control a squad of special operations soldiers who must carry out a string of tactical missions across the planet. Unlike previous Spec Ops games, a single soldier is controlled instead of a complete squad. The mission objectives include destroying enemy compounds, recovering military hardware and rescuing hostages. They take place in five different locales- Antarctica, Korea, Pakistan, Thailand, and Germany. Each country has a specific mission that entails promoting the well being of the United States of America - there is no specific storyline but rather a collection of missions to complete. Most of them are based on possible future events in the 21st century, not based on existing, historical conflicts. The success of the mission depends on the preparations (determining the equipment), which weapons are chosen and which soldier is picked. Each soldier has different abilities and some are better suited for specific missions than others. The six classed include infantry, grenadier, machine gunner, sniper, close quarters, and demolition. Each class has a different payload and arsenal to his disposal, including items such as medical kits and optical devices that are restricted to a specific soldier. The game is shown from a first-person perspective, common for the Windows titles in the series, but not the PlayStation console versions.</story>

    <story>Speed Devils- Online Racing is an updated version of Speed Devils that reuses the tracks and cars from the original game, adds new ones, and puts them into completely new modes with a focus on online multiplayer. The game includes online and offline options. Offline functions as a practice mode for online, and has only two modes- Arcade (for a standard race against AI-controlled opponents) and Ghost (for a one-on-one against oneself). At the start, car selection is limited and further cars can only be unlocked by playing online. The meat of the game is in Online mode. After customizing their online persona, players start with $10.000, enough to buy a car of the lowest class. Money must be earned by racing, enabling players to buy new cars and tune them with new parts. There are three kinds of races- Standard, Trial and Vendetta Standard races allow various ways of earning money, of which winning is only one- breaking speed limits at certain points and setting race records (highest speed, fastest lap time, leading the longest) also increase cash flow. Trial races involve wagering- a minimum amount is set by the race creator that all participants must pay to take part. The creator also sets between one and four challenges from a pool of 22 possible options. These include similar records as in the Standard races, but also challenges to always (or never) break the speed limit, bust the limit (but never twice on the same radar), get best times on specific laps, always improve times from lap to lap or not take any damage. The wagered money is distributed at the end of the race between all participants that completed their challenges, taking into account the difficulty of the challenge and the final positions of the racers. Vendetta races are always one-on-one, with the winner taking the loser&apos;s car. The game includes all the tracks from the first game (7 unique tracks in 12 configurations), adds a Heavy Winter configuration to the Canada track and adds one new track (Montreal) with three configurations, for a total of 16 different tracks, all of which can be raced in reverse or mirrored, and with weather and time of day selectable. The number of cars has been doubled from the original, adding an additional eleven.</story>

    <story>Spider-Man is the first 3D game to star the popular web-slinger. It is loosely based on Spider-Man- The Animated Series and Spider-Man Unlimited and features some of the voice cast from each and similar character designs. Peter Parker is attending a demonstration of the reformed Dr. Otto Octavius&apos;s new invention when an imposter Spider-Man steals the device. Spider-Man must work to clear his name and uncover the sinister motives behind the device&apos;s theft. This game features appearances not only by most major Spider-Man characters, but cameos by numerous other characters from the Marvel Universe, such as the Human Torch, Punisher, Daredevil and Captain America. Spider-Man&apos;s webs are greatly emphasized. He can use them both for navigational purposes, like swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive combat, such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web for extra oomph, or building a protective shield. His web supply is limited though and he must find new cartridges or risk running out. The wall-crawling powers are also prominently features. Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling. This is used for basic environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many sequences where you crawl over the heads of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and catch them off-guard. Combat is based around Spider-Man&apos;s ability to jump, kick, punch and web. By combining these with direction and in various combinations, Spider-Man is able to throw objects such as furniture, hurl web balls, yank enemies into melee range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things. There are a number of boss-battles as well, all of which are puzzle-based. Missions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door types to races to catch some or evade them or just trying to avoid the police. There are several side goals in addition the main mission including multiple unlockable Spider-Man costumes and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.</story>

    <story>A slight change from the normal excessive number of F1 games out there, Spirit of Speed 1937 was an attempt to put you into the driving seat of some of the oldest, and well known, racing cars of the early-century. Take control of one of the 1930s cars and race it out around tracks, many of which are no longer available for professional competitive racing. Whilst being a nice attempt to add some sparkle to a tired genre, many aspects of the game feel either wrong or awkward. Yes, the steering wasn&apos;t as nice on the old cars, but in simulating this the gameplay has become much harder. And why do all the cars shine as if made of polished chrome? A good attempt, but not one that rose to the surface of the day&apos;s gaming titles.</story>

    <story>Street Fighter Alpha 3, the third game in the Alpha series, has a total of 31 fighters, the most in the series so far. New characters include old favorites E. Honda, Blanka, Vega, Cammy, T. Hawk, Dee Jay, Juni and Juli. Some of the newest fighters on the block include a former Final Fight character (Cody, who has been in jail since the last Final Fight game, or so his clothing suggests), Karin Kanzuki and Rainbow Mika. The major difference between this Alpha and the last two are the new play modes World Tour, Arcade, VS, Training and Entry. World Tour - Simply choose your fighter and travel around the world, fighting the home town heroes that you run into. The more fights you win, the stronger you fighter becomes. You can also learn new moves, and there are three levels of Super moves to choose from before you start each round (called Isms). Arcade - A simple conversion of the arcade version. Beat each fighter with your chosen warrior, in three rounds per match (much the same as past versions of Street Fighter) Versus - Two human players battle it out. Training - A good way to learn all the super moves that are available, against a dummy. Entry - If you save your character during the World Tour mode, you can upload him here to use in the other modes in the game (especially handy for Training). Finally, if you complete certain areas of the game three new fighters become available, including another old favourite in Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma.</story>

The game features many clubs from around the world in some form or another, but in it&apos;s primary game tournament mode was focused around European clubs. In addition to simple and quick selection of a &apos;friendly match&apos; the game supported the following tournaments- Super Trophy - Featuring up to 32 teams drawn from a pool of over 40 of the most popular European teams. In round 1 the 32 teams start off in four leagues, each playing the other teams within the league twice. The top two teams from each league proceed to round two, similar to round one yet with two leagues of four teams. The top two teams play the final, a tie resolved with extra time and then penalties. National Team Qualifiers - a mode only unlocked when you reached 3/10 in certification tests. Belgium and Holland were not included in the list of 49 teams split into 9 groups in a pre-defined way. This was likely because the mode was designed to mirror the Euro 2000 competition, for which Infogrames did not own the license and so could not use the official name (the tournament was based in Holland/Belgium and they automatically qualified as a result). The player could choose to player any one of those 49 teams, one home and one away match against the other teams in the same group...the top team going to the finals. Group ties resolve by goal difference, scored then conceded. The best of out of all those teams which placed second in the groups also goes forward. The remaining eight second place enter a single knockout round, with four going through to the finals. National Team Finals - Must have certified 3/10 and succeeded in the National Team Qualifiers. The remaining 16 teams from the qualifiers (or a new selection), including Belgium and Holland are split into four groups of four, playing each group member once. The top two teams proceed to a knockout format - Quarters, Semis and Finals. Penalty shootouts settle ties. Territories Cup - Certified 5/10 unlocks this mode, basically league play around various world locations - completion of each cup unlocks the next territory. 8/10 in certification mode unlocked a bonus competition. The game also supported generic league and knockout tournament play, as well a classic matches - four preconfigured scenarios replaying historical matches.</story>

The professor must stop her, so her sends Super Magnetic Neo, a little boy robot with a powerful electromagnet on his head. The game has some resemblance to the Crash Bandicoot series in that some levels have you running toward the camera, have a side-view, or have you riding an animal. It contains some running, jumping and switch-flipping much like any 3D platformer. However, it does have a unique magnetism aspect. Positive and Negative charges are represented by red and blue. Neo&apos;s head can act as a positive or negative pole. This is called his magnogimmick. Using the principle of opposites charges attract and similar charges repel, Neo can pull himself toward platforms, then launch off them, or navigate many related environmental puzzles such as pulling himself into teleporters or swinging on magnetic pendulums. Enemies also come in red and blue and can pulled pulled in to be captured or pushed away to be avoided accordingly. You must use all these skills to make it through all four sections of Pao Pao Park and defeat Pinki. There is also a challenge mode, with a series of short stages to pass all based around proper use of the magnogimmick. It&apos;s something like the VR missions in the Metal Gear series.</story>

    <story>The third game in the series (the first 2 were on the PSX and called Fellony 11-79 in the west), and basicly you drive around San Francisco crashing into things. There are 2 scenarios, Scenario A places you in control of San Francisco Motors, a kind of messenger/delivery/bomb disposal service rolled up in one, while Scenario B has you playing the role of some laid-back San Francisco police officers. The two scenarios have different missions, whether it&apos;s stopping a runaway cable car, or collecting bombs for disposal.</story>

    <story>Surf Rocket Racers is a jet-ski racing game for the Dreamcast. As in most aquatic racers, success here depends on your ability to smoothly handle unpredictable waves and aggressive competition at the same time. There are several game modes to choose from. First up is the Championship. In this mode, you compete in a series of circuit races and accumulate points based on your finishing position. The racer with the most points at the end of the season wins. The other modes include a trick competition, a hazard and obstacle course, and a head-to-head 2-player mode.</story>

    <story>The official video game of the Games of the XXVII Olympiad held in 2000 in Sydney. It includes 32 nations, going for gold in 12 events divided by 6 sports- Athletics (100m dash, 110m hurdles, hammer and javelin throw, triple jump and high jump), Aquatics (200m freestyle and 10m platform diving), Kayak K1 Slalom, Super Heavyweight Weight Lifting, Skeet Shooting and Three-man track cycling pursuit. All events feature 3D graphics with cameras that mimic the ones used in TV broadcasts. Gameplay is the usual found in games of the genre - button mashing the two power buttons is required in most events to build up strength/speed, with an additional third button setting the actions, such as jumping or throwing angle. Other events feature alternate control methods, such as Slalom (where it&apos;s possible to press certain buttons to dodge the rower between the gates if the Kayak is going to hit one or place the paddle to force into a certain direction), Diving (following a click-along sequence of keys) and Skeet (the direction keys controlling the aim, one button to start and other to shoot). Along an arcade and 8-player action, the Olympic mode gives the player the option to build their athlete from the national open trials to the Olympics. By completing training drills in the Cyber Gym, the athlete increases his athletic abilities- Citius, Altius, Fortius, as told by the Olympic Motto. Before joining the competition, the player must beat national, continental and international opponents.</story>

    <story>Tech Romancer is a 3D beat-em-up with a difference; the difference being that, rather than controlling one of a set of martial artists, you control one of a set of huge robots (or mecha). Ranging from the absurd (A huge, spherical mech with a boat and bus for feet, a house for a head, train for one arm and office building with wrecking ball for another) to the &amp;quot;typical&amp;quot; anime styled mecha (Beam-firing chest gem, detatchable rocket-powered fists) to a more westernised idea of a mech (Huge, sluggish, equipped with heavy cannon, rockets, missiles and land-mines), you&apos;re bound to find at least one which suits you. The gameplay takes part in large, 3D arenas, usually dotted with buildings and such, which you&apos;ll no doubt be happy to learn are destructable (and often contain powerups). The game controls consist of two attack buttons, one block and one jump. You have a special bar, which works pretty much the same as any other special bar - once it&apos;s full (up to a maximum of 3 times) you can pull off a special move. There&apos;s an armour bar, which depletes as you take or block certain hits - if it runs out then you&apos;ll start taking hefty damage even when blocking. The life and time-bars are self-explanatory, and there&apos;s also the special-weapon inventory, which can hold up to five special weapons at a time (these are picked up from the battlefield or stolen off the enemy). The main single-player mode is a story mode, which is completely different for each character and, for most characters at least, branches many ways, often with multiple endings depending on choices made and targets met. To put it simply, this is a quirky pick-up-and-play fighting game with an extensive single-player mode.</story>

    <story>Tetris 4D is a fairly standard Tetris game that was released in Japan shortly after the Dreamcast launched. The game features two modes, Classic and Battle. Classic mode offers a normal solitaire Tetris game- rotate and fit falling blocks to complete lines. Five difficulty settings are available, which change the speed and piece preview settings. The sound and graphics generally follow a modern urban/industrial theme, with five techno music choices, including a variation of the classic Tetris Karinka. The 3D backgrounds are basic but shift viewpoint as you advance in levels. The Battle mode offers two to four player multiplayer. One player starts off flagged, and blocks push up from the bottom as other players make lines. Once he makes enough lines himself the flag moves to another player. Difficulty is set independently allowing for handicaps. Unfortunately, you can&apos;t play the battle mode against the computer. There&apos;s also no VMU support for saving high scores, a rather critical omission for this type of game.</story>

For those unfamiliar with the Tokyo Xtreme Racer series, unlike other racing games, TXR 2 (and others in the series) implements a system found most commonly on fighting games, where each player has a life bar and the player with remain life wins the race. Different factors can cause the life bar of a player to deplete, include hitting into object, other cars, or just simply falling behind the lead car.</story>

Some goals involve obtaining a high score, others smashing objects, and some collecting objects. For every goal you complete, you earn a video tape. By collecting enough video tapes, you unlock levels and skateboards for you to use. There are 6 levels like this. The second type of level is a competition. You get to make 3 timed runs through a skate park, and attempt to get the highest score possible. If you do well enough, you will beat the scores of the computer controlled skaters and win a medal. There are 3 levels like this. There are nine real life pro skaters you can choose to play as, including Tony Hawk himself. Each skater has their own signature moves that earn you big points if pulled off successfully.</story>

Toy Commander is a game that attempts to capture these adventures in an interactive, three dimensional world. The player&apos;s perspective is that of the toy vehicles that inhabit a house. The various gameplay areas are all based on rooms in this giant house. Gameplay in Toy Commander is mission based. In each mission, you control one or more toy vehicles to accomplish certain objectives. The objectives in each mission vary widely. In some missions, you must drive an army truck and shoot things, in some you fly helicopters to pick up and drop off objects, and in some you must race against computer controlled vehicles. There is a story line that ties together the missions in single player mode. A coalition of old toys has started a rebellion against the new toys in the house. An evil Teddy Bear, the Toy Commander, is leading this rebellion. It&apos;s your job to stop him. In each mission, your basic goal is to complete the task in as short a time as possible. If you meet a certain time goal, the mission is completed. By completing 4 missions, you get to challenge the Boss character in the room. If you successfully destroy the boss, he will assist you in the final fight against the Toy Commander. In addition to the single player mode, there is a 4-player simultaneous deathmatch mode.</story>

    <story>In the distant future humanity will develop intelligent weapons called Trigger Hearts. Despite their awesome offensive strengths, Trigger Hearts aesthetically closely resemble humans, and overtime even develop unique personalities. Of three existing Trigger Hearts one, named Faintear, has mysteriously vanished two years ago. The story begins as the two remaining Trigger Hearts - Exelica and Crueltear (who took on the personality of Exelica&apos;s big sister) are summoned to quell a mysterious rebellion of military machines against their human creators. Trigger Heart Exelica is an arcade-style top-down shooter and is composed of 5 stages of shooting mayhem. Most levels take place in futuristic environments such as sky cities and space stations. The player is given a choice of one of the two Trigger Hearts at the beginning of the game - Exelica, who emits a wide fan of weak shots, and Crueltear, who fires a narrowly concentrated barrage of projectiles. However, the firing pattern of guns matters little during the game, as Trigger Heart&apos;s most awesome weapon is common to both models, and is called the Anchor Shot. By using the Anchor Shot Trigger Hearts are able to grab, swing, use as a shield, and hurl back any flying enemy vehicle in the game, including even the most giant of enemy battle cruisers. When thrown, the enemy cuts a path of destruction across the entire screen, causing explosive chain reactions between adjacent ships and occasionally even obliterating bosses in one hit. The Anchor Shot is a tricky weapon to use, as it requires the player to circle the joystick in order to give enemy ships more inertia while continuing to dodge enemy fire. The trajectory of the released enemy is also somewhat difficult to predict. Another innovative feature of Trigger Heart Exelica is AI-adjusted boss difficulty level, which will cut more slack to the inexperienced player, while attempting to punish the pros. In addition to the original Arcade mode the home version of the game includes a Story mode, which adds fully voiced cutscenes, additional endings and bosses throughout the game, and Arranged Mode, which is just like the arcade mode, but is limited to Normal difficulty, no continues, and only two lives, and serves as a challenge to the most experienced players. The PS2 port includes a new opening movie, story mode and CG sequences. TH44 Faintear is now a player selectable fighter and The Triggerheart Backupper C&apos;r_na, originally only a story concept, now appears in the game.</story>

    <story>A unique combination of vertically-scrolling shooters and competitive puzzle games, Twinkle Star Sprites tells the story of the apprentice witch Ran, who searches for the fabled Twinkle Star that is said to grant any wish to the one that finds it. Unfortunately she is not the only one seeking the star, and thus must fight her way and defeat all the other characters that seek the star in shooter duels. The game plays mostly as a vertically-scrolling shooter, with you controlling your avatar and attempting to shoot and avoid the incoming enemies. The difference in this game is that each player has his own play area, a la Puyo Puyo, and the enemies cause splash damage around themselves when shot. Thus chaining the destruction of several enemies creates a combo that performs an attack move on your opponent. These moves can range from targeted fireballs, to special moves unique to each character, to the summoning of special boss characters that the other player must destroy before continuing. Each player has a lifebar, and as with most shooters there are bombs, and collectible power-ups to be found. The game features an arcade mode in which you can freely select what character you want to control, as well as a 2-player Vs mode and a story mode chronicling Ran&apos;s journey.</story>

Much like the Resident Evil series, the zombie hordes have gone from infesting a vaguely gothic creepy old mansion to infesting a vaguely gothic decaying city, and its your job to stop them and save the human race (as usual).</story>

    <story>European soccer game based around the UEFA license. Effectively a merger between Rage software&apos;s Striker franchise and playstation/dreamcast evolution with Infogrames&apos; UEFA license. UEFA Striker offered a mix of arcade and simulation style gameplay and a certification mode, where the player was tested for skills in order to unlock game modes. The game featured many clubs from around the world in some form or another, but in it&apos;s primary game tournament mode was focused around European clubs. In addition to simple and quick selection of a &apos;friendly match&apos; the game supported the following tournaments- Super Trophy - Featuring up to 32 teams drawn from a pool of over 40 of the most popular European teams. In round 1 the 32 teams start off in four leagues, each playing the other teams within the league twice. The top two teams from each league proceed to round two, similar to round one yet with two leagues of four teams. The top two teams play the final, a tie resolved with extra time and then penalties. National Team Qualifiers - a mode only unlocked when you reached 3/10 in certification tests. Belgium and Holland were not included in the list of 49 teams split into 9 groups in a pre-defined way. This was likely because the mode was designed to mirror the Euro 2000 competition, for which Infogrames did not own the license and so could not use the official name (the tournament was based in Holland/Belgium and they automatically qualified as a result). The player could choose to player any one of those 49 teams, one home and one away match against the other teams in the same group...the top team going to the finals. Group ties resolve by goal difference, scored then conceded. The best of out of all those teams which placed second in the groups also goes forward. The remaining eight second place enter a single knockout round, with four going through to the finals. National Team Finals - Must have certified 3/10 and succeeded in the National Team Qualifiers. The remaining 16 teams from the qualifiers (or a new selection), including Belgium and Holland are split into four groups of four, playing each group member once. The top two teams proceed to a knockout format - Quarters, Semis and Finals. Penalty shootouts settle ties. Territories Cup - Certified 5/10 unlocks this mode, basically league play around various world locations - completion of each cup unlocks the next territory. 8/10 in certification mode unlocked a bonus competition. The game also supported generic league and knockout tournament play, as well a classic matches - four preconfigured scenarios replaying historical matches. Live commentary was from Ron Atkinson and Jonathan Pearce.</story>

What makes the game (and the real-life counterpart) distinct from wrestling, boxing, and other fights is the variety of fighting styles in use; it is perfectly possible to end up with a judo master facing a kickboxer. The actual gameplay is simple enough. You have various basic moves, combos, holds, and so on. The complications come in the form of the huge list of moves, featuring many different styles. Hit your opponent until he gets knocked out, or force him to tap out early. There are multiple game modes included. Among them are a survival mode, that has you face a string of enemies with minimal recovery, and career mode, which allows you to customize and improve your fighting style as you win fights.</story>

While the gameplay is fairly typical for a vertical shooters, Under Defeat innovates by allowing players to tilt their vehicles slightly left and right, changing the angle of their fire. The game was available in two different editions - a regular version, and a collector&apos;s edition pack that included a soundtrack CD. Unlike most Dreamcast games which traditionally shipped in a jewel case, both versions of Under Defeat came in a DVD-sized keep case.</story>

    <story>Unreal Tournament is completely different to Unreal - it&apos;s now mainly based on multiplayer, like Quake 3. At the beginning, you have to play classic deathmatch rounds. After you have successfully won some of them, a new game mode becomes available, domination. In domination there are about 3 or 4 different areas scattered around the map to be controlled by your team. For a certain amount of seconds you control one area, a point is added to your score. The more areas you control, the faster your team&apos;s score rises. When you or the other team reaches a certain score, the game is over. The 3rd mode is called capture the flag, every team has a flag to defend and tries to capture the other team&apos;s flag to score a point. The 4th game mode is probably the most innovative one, it&apos;s called assault. These are real missions, like you have to attack an enemy base and destroy something in it. Again, there are two teams, the defenders and the attackers. You have to complete the mission in a certain time, like 5 or 10 minutes. If you were successful, your team has to defend this time and the other team attacks. But the attacking team now only has as much time as you needed to attack. All these modes are either playable in single or multiplayer mode. If playing alone, you have a large menu with orders you can give your bots. Also, all weapons were redesigned, and some new ones are added.</story>

What&apos;s more, there are loads of computer controlled cars that are there simply to slow you down. The standard racing game modes are here- Tournament, Time Trial, and Single Race. One unique feature, however, is the stunt competition. You can compete in a series of events that test various driving skills in timed events. Some example events are the long jump and the slalom. The selection of cars is quite diverse. You can race vehicles that range from low performance, like a VW Microbus, to high performance, like a Dodge Viper.</story>

    <story>The idea for this game is that you must build barriers on the arena to stop the water from leaking out. As you go along, rain starts to fall onto the arena, so you better keep the walls as high as possible. Too much on the screen, though, will start and earthquake. Ice blocks fall to freeze the water. Bombs drop, leaving holes in your walls and fireballs dry up the water. Simply go as long as possible to get as high a score as you can. There is a practice mode available, and you can play against a friend.</story>

    <story>Wild Metal Country is an action game in which one of five little tanks can be selected to control. Tank-like machines have gone wild on the three different planets of the Tehric system and the player&apos;s job is to defeat them. The battles take place in desolate mountain environments. The big differences in altitude play an important role in the game. In the single player mode, complete levels by collecting 8 colored power cores, which are defended by the machines, and returning them to one of several hovering stores. The player has an infinite amount of lives. The weaponry consists of 8 types of missiles and 4 types of mines. Help is received from a pair of helicopters that drop ammo and provide healing. The two tracks of the tank are operated independently. For example, make a quick spin by going forward with one track and backwards with the other. Moreover the turret can be turned in any direction. The camera always moves with the turret sometimes diverting the view towards the camera. The angle of the turret and the distance the rockets travel can be changed. The tank can only be controlled using the keyboard. Noteworthy aspects of the game are- the physics modelling, the 3D engine and the amount of freedom the player has (no time constraints etc.).</story>

You can play an exhibition game or a season of 13-162 games, including an All-Star game and play-offs. Gameplay is the standard behind-the-catcher viewpoint for batting and pitching, switching to different views after the ball is hit. The famous limitation of World Series Baseball 2K1 is that you cannot control the fielders until after the ball is fielded! For this reason the game was almost universally panned by reviewers upon its release. This flaw was fixed in subsequent releases of the World Series Baseball franchise.</story>

    <story>The final sequel (at least using the present engine) to the strategy game Worms, Worms Armageddon expands on Worms 2 by improving quite a few facets of gameplay and including play over the Internet through Team 17&apos;s WORMNET. For those who&apos;ve never played Worms, it&apos;s at heart similar to the old game Artillery, which you control an artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit your enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a team of Worms, but not only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep. Everything is presented in a humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves and their cries of triumph or despair, depending on how you do. Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and while an improvement over Worms 2, it&apos;s not a huge change.</story>

Up to 6 players can battle out at the same time on local networks or on the internet, using Team17 own matchmaking service, called Wormnet. Other welcomed additions are the Wormpot, which can provide 400 gameplay variations from Goliath Mode to Bleeding Worms, hundreds of new landscapes, flags and fanfares, and a load of single player missions.</story>

    <story>Zero Gunner 2 would on first inspection appear to be a bog-standard 2D shooter. However this import game actually has a bit of a unique spin on the shooter genre. Most noticable, all backdrops and vehicles in this game are modelled in 3D. The textures are quite highly detailed and this adds more depth than standard 2D shooters. Secondly, since your craft is a helicopter, a unique target and spin feature has been added whereby you can both rotate your craft to better attack an enemy or alternatively to lock on a particular point in space and rotate around it while still firing. This is all controlled by the player however and is not automatic; to succeed mastering this feature is imperative. The usual power-ups and bosses are included, along with a selection of helicopters to select from.</story>
