    <story>The name is Bond. James Bond. The famous hero of Ian Fleming&apos;s novels returns in this first-person shooter, which is based on the movie of the same name. Agent 007 and his friend Alec Trevalyan (a.k.a. Agent 006) were sent to Soviet Union on a secret mission. But everything goes wrong, James Bond barely escapes, and his friend is presumed dead. Ten years later, a mysterious organization named Janus appeared. Commanding a new satellite called GoldenEye, the organizations attempts to steal money electronically from banks, deleting all evidence of transfer. It&apos;s up to our Agent 007 to venture to Soviet Union once again, and to put an end to Janus&apos; ambitions. In this 3D action game, you control James Bond from a first-person perspective, using a variety of weapons (from knuckles to grenade launcher) to eliminate your foes. However, many parts require you to be careful, to stay unnoticed or to snipe guards from distance, since they will react to your presence and alarm their comrades. The game is divided into missions, and in some of them you&apos;ll have to perform other tasks besides killing your enemies- disarm bombs, take pictures of important evidence, or avoid killing scientists. The game features a multiplayer mode with a variety of options, and three difficulty levels.</story>

    <story>007- The World is Not Enough is a James Bond game based on the 1999 movie of the same name. Both game and film follow Bond&apos;s investigation of attacks on a British oil tycoon&apos;s new pipeline, while the game introduces new areas and backstory not seen in the film. James Bond is a MI5 agent that employs gadgets and gunplay. With each mission requiring the player to complete specific objectives outlined in a pre-mission briefing. In contrast to the PlayStation title of the same name, this version is structured more like a successor to Rare&apos;s GoldenEye 007. There are 14 missions with three difficulty settings (Agent, Special Agent, 00 Agent), and higher difficulty settings add increasingly complicated objectives to each mission. An Awards system encourages replay by granting new multiplayer skins, maps, and modes for beating target times for single-player levels. The game includes a local, split-screen multiplayer mode for up to four players, or a combination of computer-controlled bots. Some levels are taken from single-player mode, while others are exclusive to multiplayer. New game modes include King of the Hill, Capture The Briefcase, and Last Agent Standing. The notorious Golden Gun also returns from GoldenEye 007, and retains its one-shot-kill power. Weapon groups and victory conditions can be tweaked at the start of a multiplayer match.</story>

    <story>Aidyn Chronicles- The First Mage follows the story of Alaron, poisoned by mysterious goblins while out on patrol in the grounds of King Loyd&apos;s kingdom. Without a common cure, Alaron must set out on a journey with a selection of companions in search of the antidote. Little does Alaron know that the journey is even more dangerous then first thought, with a mysterious evil force brewing in the distance. A 3D fantasy role playing game, you must complete a set of quests, through the use of items and magic, while following a slightly non-linear storyline, in which you choose in what order the tasks can be completed. The game features two distinctive different modes- exploring and fighting. Alaron explores the game world freely, discover special places and talk to its inhabitants. There are no random encounters but if he meets an enemy the game switches to the combat screen. Combat is basically turn based but not in the usual console RPG way- during a character&apos;s turn he can be moved in real-time in a circular way - the characters move constantly towards each other. When two rings intersect the characters can launch a regular or magic attack. The party selection (up to four characters) is pre-defined by the story.</story>

Instead of the usual skateboards the game features hoover boards. 1 Player option features the following modes- 1. Lecture – mode where you can learn the controls and the terms the game uses. 2. Street Work – the main mode of the game. At the beginning there are 4 available characters (total of 8), 5 stages and 4 boards (total of 12) from which you can choose. At each stage you are given a time limit in which you must perform as many tricks as possible with your board. There are also yellow circles lying around that you must pass through. Each time you pass through one the timer resets back and if you pass through all the game ends regardless of how much time is left. When the game ends you get a rank depending on the points you accumulated and if the rank is high enough a level of higher difficulty is unlocked (with a total of 3 difficulty levels per stage). 3. Time Attack – you must pass through all the coloured circles in a designated order and within the least time possible. The spots where the circles are can be seen via a map that appears on the screen. 4. Coin – mode in which you must get all the coins that are scattered on each stage within the time limit. 5. Free Run – this mode is free of challenges (no time limit or points) and mostly serves as a means of getting you acquainted with each stage. 2 Players option features the following modes- 1. Vs. Race – 2 Player race where the one that passes through all of the yellow circles, in the order that is specified wins. 6. Vs. Coin – another 2 Player mode where the player who gets all the coins or has the most when the time limit ends wins.</story>

    <story>Big Mountain 2000 is a sports game where you can choose to race with either a snowboard or a ski. There are six characters (plus three unlockables) to choose from, each with different skills and three modes in total – two of them are single player and the other one is a multiplayer. 1. Championship- in Championship you can select one of the available players and choose the style you want – ski or snowboard. You can also change each player’s equipment which includes ski/snowboard and clothes. The game also lets you choose in which stage you want to compete and the race type you want to play. Race Type includes three options – Free Ride, Slalom and Giant Slalom. In Free Ride you compete against 3 more CPU players, you must finish first and before time, which can be renewed at every checkpoint, runs out. In Slalom and Giant Slalom you must pass through the flags that are scattered throughout the course and again like in Free Ride finish first. The differences between the Slalom-Giant Slalom are the later’s course being wider and the flags less. By successfully completing any of the above your players skills like cornering, acceleration, etc. are increased. 2. 2P Battle- in 2P Battle two human players can compete in any of the Free Ride-Slalom-Giant Slalom races. It is possible to either choose a player from the game or load a previously saved player data from a Controller Pak. There are also no restrictions on the style each player will choose. For example one may choose to play with a skier and the other with a snowboarder. 3. Time Attack- there are no other competitors in this mode – just you racing against time.</story>

    <story>Get out of the way! A nuclear missile carrier is out of control on a one way-set path, and unless that path is cleared, it will explode as soon as it makes contact with anything, destroying the world. It is up to you to clear the path so that nothing gets in the way of the Carrier. Blast Corps is a mix of an action and a puzzle game where destruction is key. At the start of each level the player is given a certain vehicle (ranging from robotic suits, trucks, or bulldozers), and are told to clear the path for the Carrier. Players need to use their heavy-duty equipment to destroy any buildings, structures, or monuments that stand in the path of the Carrier. The difficulty increases as progress is made, though. Smaller vehicles don&apos;t affect certain buildings, and sometimes its not even a building that&apos;s in the way. The player must use the resources around them to clear the path. Players may need a train flatbed to fill a gap, or a crane to move boxes out of the way. The Carrier is always moving, so once the player is done destroying one obstruction, they must get to the next one quickly. While players pursue their mission they must also find six scientists scattered throughout the globe to form a think-tank to solve the problem. The Carrier has to leave Earth, and it&apos;s your job to ensure that it does! Blast Corps features many secrets to find. Besides clearing each path for the Carrier, players can go back to a level once ts over to take their time and explore. To fully complete a level, players must also find RDU&apos;s (Radiation Dispersal Units) which light up on the ground when the player is in close proximity to them. Players must also destroy all of the buildings, and rescue all of the homeless civilians, which is done by the T-chopper that accompanies the player on every mission. There are also dozens of secret time trial levels that can be found by activating special satellite dishes hidden throughout the levels. If the player manages to get all of the secrets in a level they receive a second medal, and once all of the gold medals are found the developers have a tiny message for them...</story>

    <story>The inhabitants of Bomber World have a unique philosophy of life- if something gets in the way, blow it up. Now you, too, can join in the fun with Hudson Soft&apos;s Bomberman 64. In Bomberman 64&apos;s all-new one-player Adventure mode, marauders have set their sights on Bomberman&apos;s peaceful planet. You&apos;ll explore labyrinthine levels by dropping bombs, solving puzzles and finding hidden items. The action takes place across five brightly colored worlds- a smoldering volcano, ruined castle, icy mountain range, orbiting space station and storybook village. Find all 100 Gold Cards in the first five worlds and you can access a sixth world. To maximize your score, you&apos;ll need to finish each of the 20 levels as quickly as possible. Deadlines are tighter on the Hard difficulty setting. Despite the prevalence of incendiary devices, Bomberman 64&apos;s overhead perspective, cartoon-like graphics and bright palette gives the game the cheerful feel of Super Mario RPG. It&apos;s Bomberman 64&apos;s multiplayer mode, though, that really blows the socks off the pyrotechnicians at Power Source. In Single Battle mode, dashing about the baffling arenas and blowing each other to smithereens proves to be, well, a blast. Team Battle mode is a highly explosive version of capture-the-flag. Your goal here is to destroy the enemy team&apos;s gems while protecting your own. You can choose the number and duration of battles. You can also choose from three levels of artificial intelligence for CPU-controlled bombers. When the Ghost option is selected, your little guy will return as a wispy double of his old self after he&apos;s gone boom. Ghosts can control a normal Bomberman, but they cannot deploy bombs. You&apos;ll savor Bomberman 64&apos;s sneaky new features, including extremely high explosives and the ability to toss or kick your bombs diagonally. Other new features include the ability to pump up bombs, knock foes unconscious, grab and toss unconscious foes, and toss or kick bombs diagonally. Bomberman 64 is a blast!</story>

    <story>Motorized carnage. Ever wanted to hit pedestrians during a race? Now&apos;s your chance. Carmageddon is an ultra-violent racing game which caused much controversy during the &apos;90s but was also very popular due to its fun factor. It was also one of the first batch of games to make use of 3D accelerated graphics (using OpenGL and 3dfx Voodoo cards). At the beginning of the game the player only has one car and is ranked at #99. The overall objective is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents&apos; cars on the way as trophies (and possibly replacements to his vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits for the player which can be used for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during the race. If you wreck a certain car in 4 races or so, you get to drive it. There are many power-ups strewn around the courses which range from useful to fun to downright absurd. Though the player can win by racing fairly and normally, most players found it much more fun to wreck everything in sight. Carmageddon is a violent game which is probably not suitable for minors.</story>

To begin with, set 8 years before the events that took place in Castlevania, the Count has kidnapped the young sister of Cornell, a powerful werewolf. As Cornell, you must battle your way through the castle and defeat Dracula to save your sister. Once completing the game as Cornell, you take up the role of Henry, a demon hating hero who must save captured children from the hands of Dracula within a set time limit. After that, you can then take on Dracula once again as the original heroes of Castlevania 64, Reinhardt Schneider and Carrie Fernandez, and re-live the events of the previous game through new and improved surroundings.</story>

The player can either choose to be Reinhardt Schneider (for the traditional whip action) or Carrie Fernandez (who uses magical powers). Both characters have their own story line. A nice feature is the presence of an in-game clock which changes the time of the day (either day or night).

The basic game features a multiplayer mode (up to 4 players), a tournament mode and an exhibition mode. You also have four mini-games, Tennis Court Bingo, Burning Barrels, Run and Gun &amp; Knock&apos;em Down, where your goal is to hit certain objects in the tennis field. You can win special prices for getting enough points. Additionally, you have a special challenge mode where you have to play against your opponent in odd conditions - your tennis field might be rotating, made from ice or about to explode, to name a few. Beat your foe and you will be rewarded with a piece clothing or item of your choosing from your opponent&apos;s dressing room. Lose and you lose an item that your opponent picked. Keep on losing and you have to play your games wearing nothing but your underwear, which makes the game like a sort of family-friendly strip tennis.</story>

Charlie has a convincing beer belly, he has trouble keeping his jeans up (yup, you will get a nice view of his crack quite frequently) and his chest hair makes David Hasselhoff feel ashamed about himself. He is not trying to save a princess either; his mission is to blow islands up with TNT! With 3D graphics and some platform elements, Charlie Blast&apos;s Territory, a remake of Kablooey, is a modernization of one of the classic puzzle genres where your goal is to push crates into the correct spots. Every level is an island. On every island you have at least one bomb and one TNT box. Your goal is to push all of them next to each others and then blow everything up in a huge chain reaction. When you do, you advance a level. You cannot pull the crates but you can climb over them.</story>

Clay Fighter- Sculptor&apos;s Cut is a parody of one-on-one fighting games and features sixteen playable clay (!) fighters, including Sumo Santa, Statue of Liberty, Booger Man and the legendary Earthworm Jim himself! It is the sequel to Clay Fighter 63 1/3 and famous for only being released as a Blockbuster rental exclusive. Like the title suggests, it is not an entirely new game but rather a different version of it. The most notable differences are the four extra playable characters and a 2D-style fixed camera angle. You cannot perform unlimited combos anymore either. Moves are a mix of standard punches &amp; kicks (although not all of the contestants have hands nor legs to begin with) and a large number of unique special moves and combos for all. You can sometimes interact with your environment by kicking your opponent through a door or window and continue on the other side. You can also end the fights with Mortal Kombat-style Claytalities.</story>

The control system of selecting units with the mouse and then directing them is similar to future titles such as Total Annihilation. The game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. You can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry. In most missions you have to build a base first to build new units and structures. Most important are the special harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it&apos;s converted into money - money which is needed to create additional units. The game also features FMV mission briefings and victory cutscenes.</story>

Various pre-game options included are the choice of automatic or manual transmission, various controller configurations, as well as background music selection option. Players take control of the vehicle from a third-person perspective, and while avoiding various hazards along the way, must beat the clock as well as the CPU controlled rivals to gain first-place. With fourteen courses to ultimately choose from, Cruis&apos;n USA takes players on a tour across some of the most famous and notorious roads and highways across the continent. Some of the locations include- Golden Gate Park, Redwood Forest, Beverly Hills and the Grand Canyon.</story>

    <story>Pack your bags and prepare for a first class trip around the world. Your ticket is courtesy of Midway, who has transformed its arcade mega-hit Cruis&apos;n World into an all-new racer for the N64. Cruis&apos;n USA thrilled racers with a scenic trip across the highways of America, but this time the action will take you all around the world. Each track is packed full of realistic scenery and authentic landmarks, so playing this game could save you a lot of dough on travel expenses. You can catch a glimpse of the Sphinx, the Statue of Liberty, and the Mayan ruins without leaving the security of your living room couch. If you&apos;re looking for a realistic racing simulation with real world physics, then this is definitely not the game for you. The graphics are realistic, but the actual game play is twisted to the extreme. Even though blazing across the Great Wall of China may be unbelievable, it certainly is fun. You can leap-frog over a semi truck with a police car, or perform a back flip with a military ATV. Add to this a bonus race that takes place on the moon, and you have a good idea of Midway&apos;s over-the-top execution of the Cruis&apos;n concept. Many of us will never get the chance to visit the Egyptian pyramids, let alone the opportunity to drive a screaming ambulance straight through them. Cruis&apos;n World provides fun fantasy racing action, and the best thing about it is that you won&apos;t have to worry about your luggage getting left behind in Russia.</story>

After the islands prized racetracks become sealed up, Timber Tiger contacts his friend Diddy Kong to help him reclaim the racetracks and save the island before his parents return. Along for the ride are the Kremling spy Krunch, Bumper Badger, Banjo (prior to meeting Kazooie in Banjo-Kazooie), pre-sweary Conker, Tiptup Turtle, and Pipsy Mouse. Diddy Kong Racing is a racing game with similarities to Mario Kart 64, in that you race with a variety of cheery racers while using weapons. However, the similarities end there. DKR includes an adventure mode, which features bosses, an overworld to explore, many hidden secrets, the addition of hovercrafts and planes, and a unique way of racing called the Silver Coin Challenge. In this mode, in addition to coming first, you must also find the eight Silver Coins deviously hidden throughout the courses (some in alternate paths). The game also features a strategic method of using weapons. Each colored balloon on the track matches a specific weapon, and collecting the same type of balloon multiple times in a row powers it up (to a maximum of three times). This gives the player the choice of snatching every balloon available and using it immediately, or storing the existing weapon, and using a more powerful version of it later. Up to four players can compete in the races, but in order to play new tracks, they must first be unlocked in the single player game. There are also four battle modes of play - two standard deathmatch maps, a capture-the-flag style battle where you must nab eggs and hatch three of them in your home nest, and another where you must be the first to return ten bananas to your treasure chest (with the limitation of only being able to hold two at any one time)</story>

The player starts only being able to choose Donkey Kong, and must rescue the other four characters from the early levels before they can be used.

    <story>Duke Nukem 3D makes its way to the N64 for the first time, with plenty of new additions- Weapons- New weapons include two sub-machine guns (one in each hand), the Expander (the bad guys just go pop!) a plasma cannon (which is chargeable) and a grenade launcher. Sadly, there are a few missing from the original PC version, including the Ripper Chaingun, the Devastator, and the Freeze-Ray. Presentation- The biggest changes come here, as there are new areas to explore, some improved environments, and the same wise cracks that have made Duke famous. There are also some jokes hidden away based on classic movies (Clockwork Orange, 12 Monkeys, Mars Attacks and Apocalypse Now). However, there have been plenty of restrictions in this version of Duke 3D. Nintendo have replaced some areas (the porn mag shop has turned into a gun store, the bar is now a burger joint, and the nude women aren&apos;t nude anymore), and there is an option available to turn the blood off. A 4 player mode has also been included, where you can take on your mates as well as Duke Bots, and a 2 player co-op mode, so two players can tackle the single player missions.</story>

There are several game modes to choose from. First, there is a season mode with multiple skill levels. Completing a 5-race season in first place unlocks special tracks and more difficult classes. Second, there is a exhibition mode which allows you and up to 3 other people to choose a single track to race on. Third, there is a time trial mode in which you try to get the best times on the 20 tracks. Finally. there are multiple special tracks. Some of the special tracks include a point-to-point race through the desert, a hill-climb competition, motocross soccer, and a pixel-perfect conversion of the original Excitebike. Excitebike 64 also includes a track editor for building your own competitions.</story>

    <story>Famed SNES racer F-Zero got this N64 update. Gameplay remains essentially unchanged, race in a futuristic racing tournament on tracks levitated miles up in the air, against a selection of devious opponents. Where the original had 4 cars to choose from and race against, F-Zero X has no fewer than 30 vehicles all with their own unique strengths and weaknesses, a choice of colours, and customisable power/acceleration ratios for each track. At the beginning you are limited to choosing from 6 cars and 3 tournaments (each featuring 6 tracks each), but in true Nintendo fashion, more cars and tracks are unlocked as you progress through the game. As well as the cups, you can also race in time trial mode, against a &apos;ghost car&apos; recording of your best previous lap, a lá Mario Kart 64. Gone are the entirely flat tracks of the original, having been replaced with tracks that twist, turn, loop, rotate and basically contort into the most crazy shapes you could imagine. One unique feature amongst almost all other racing games is the X tournament, where courses are totally randomly generated each time you start. One of the most important changes to the format is the inclusion of multiplayer support for up to 4 players. The various combat moves are especially important against aggressive human play. This game has a rock soundtrack, which I believe is the first game soundtrack ever to feature the bestial grunting found only in death metal music.</story>

Few would dare to brave its unstable and searing environments - only those determined to grab a little of its remaining gold.

Forsaken is a first-person shoot &apos;em up in which you have complete movement freedom in 3 dimensions, as you accelerate, swerve and strafe your craft, making for gameplay resembling Descent. Each level has a defined exit which must be reached within a tight time limit. The surrounding areas are collapsing around you, with spikes and turbine fans among your hazards. Be very aware of other craft out to take all you have, as they alter their approach based on your weaponry (from the 25 featured in the game) and past encounters. On the PC, multiplayer action can feature up to 12 human players. The Nintendo 64 version featured 4 player split-screen multiplayer, while the Playstation version has no multiplayer options.</story>

    <story>As many as four (Expansion Pak required) can band together in an epic quest through seven magical worlds -- three of which are brand-new to the home version -- to defeat the vile Skorne. The nonlinear action begins in a hub, which leads to the worlds, each with two to five levels. You can complete a level in one world, then move to another world, returning later to finish a new level in the first world. Developer Atari Games has delivered four new characters in addition to the four in the arcade version. Each character will have unique special attacks. Controller Pak support will allow players to team their evolving characters. Enemies, bosses, power-ups, music and sound effects are all getting radical makeovers. Atari is busily remapping carryover levels and cooking up devious new puzzles and hiding places for items, so don&apos;t even think of cribbing from the coin-op version. Graphical updates include real-time lighting, which is nowhere to be found in the arcade version. The N64 Expansion Pak pushes plenty of polygon-based enemies onto the screen. The essential action -- team up with others, find keys, magic, runes and other items, and beat the stuffing out of anyone in your way -- remains unchanged from the arcade hit. Atari has delivered a far meatier storyline, though, spiffed up by cinema cut-scenes at the successful conclusion of a world.</story>

    <story>Hexen is the sequel to Heretic. While the Heretic was destroying D&apos;Sparil, the other two Serpent Riders have come to your dimension and slaughtered everyone. Or so they thought. Three humans have managed to escape with their lives and now seek vengeance against the Serpent Rider Korax who remains in their world. Like Heretic, Hexen is a fantasy game based on an enhanced DOOM engine. All of Heretic&apos;s innovations like vertical looking, flying, and the inventory system have been carried over. The new major changes this time around are three characters for the player to choose from and the level hub system. The characters are the Fighter, the Cleric, and the Mage. Each one has four unique weapons and different levels of speed and armor. The hub system steps away from the traditional single levels stringed along into episodes system which had been carried over into the FPS genre from sidescrollers and made popular by Wolfenstein 3D. In Hexen&apos;s hub system each episode is still made up of interconnected levels, but most of the levels are connected to a single hub level through portals. There are also portals between some of the spoke levels. Many of the puzzles in Hexen require travel back and forth between different levels. Other innovations in Hexen included weather effects, jumping, earth-quakes, and destructible objects such as trees and vases.</story>

    <story>The year is 1947. Dr. Jones Jr is on a retirement from adventuring, living the life of a scholar and an archaeologist. But soon he meets his old flame ...and new enemies. Soviets are tracking parts of a mysterious, powerful machine from ancient Babylon, hoping to use it as a weapon. They must be stopped from unleashing unspeakable danger from another world. Are you ready to lead Indy into adventures in lost temples, under mountains and through unexplored mines, for tales of missing artifacts, snake encounters and other things? Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine combined action and adventure in a way the older Indy games did not do. The gameplay is inspired by Tomb Raider, as Indy moves through 3D representations of 17 locations around the world. The game engine is modified from Jedi Knight. Puzzles based around switches &amp; items; precise jumping must be negotiated on regular basis. You must use ladders, ropes and dinghies as well as moving on foot. You will also find yourself aboard a jeep and a mine cart. Replacements for your standard whip can be collected en route (from Soviet army arsenal), including grenades, sub-machine guns and bazookas. The valuable treasures you find can be used to buy extra ammo (between the levels). After each level you get your score (Indy Quotient) - you must reach all the treasure items cleverly hidden in secret places to get all the points.</story>

    <story>Twins Juno and Vela, and their dog Lupus, are Jet Force Gemini, intergalactic police. Their mission? Stop the evil space bug, Mizar, from his goal of galactic conquest with his seemingly-infinite army of Drones. They&apos;ll have to stop along multiple planets along the way, and assisting King Jeff and rescuing his subjects, the Tribals. Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter which revels in making gigantic creepy bugs explode into dribbly mucousy bits. The Jet Force team are given progressively more powerful weapons, from the Machine Gun, which rips through both enemies and ammo, the Plasma Shotgun, which you can charge up for some explosive fireworks, and the Tri-Rocket Launcher, which fires three rockets with every shot, sending explosive doom in the direction of your target. There&apos;s also the Fish Food, which is used to...er, feed fish. Really. Even though they&apos;re called Drones, these bugs aren&apos;t stupid. When encountered, they&apos;ll rush you, hide behind objects for cover, and even run off for reinforcements when you confront them. They also take delight in shooting the innocent Tribals, whom you are supposed to be rescuing. But the Drones are nothing compared to the game&apos;s insanely difficult bosses, which includes a pair of gigantic praying mantis, a huge beetle, and of course, Mizar himself, to name but a few. Each of their team has their own special abilities - Juno can walk through lava without any trouble, Vela can swim underwater, and Lupus can hover for short distances and travel through tight spaces. These abilities are required to fully access areas that they previously couldn&apos;t reach. The team also get the help of Floyd the Droid, a hovering robot that can be controlled by player two as a floating gun with infinite ammo when he joins your team. The game also includes three different multiplayer modes- Battle - featuring most options of an average First Person Shooter but with a third-person perspective, Target Shoot - a shooting gallery with a first-person view, and Racing, which includes some kart-like racing as well as old-school top down racing games.</story>

    <story>You play Hiro Miyamoto an average martial arts instructor who gets involved in a mission of time-shattering proportions. You must rescue the girl from the evil corporation, find the sword with the girl, and travel back in time with the sword, the girl and a Superfly to get a vaccine for a virus that has wiped out two-thirds of the world&apos;s populace. The sword is the Daikatana, a weapon wielded by your ancestors, and you are… a guy with guns that fires at things a lot. This is a shooter, which means that while there are cutscenes and plotlines happening in the background, most of it is window dressing for miles of action and gallons of blood and flayed flesh.</story>

    <story>Kirby&apos;s adventure for the Nintendo 64 is a polygonal side-scroller similar to Klonoa - however, unlike Klonoa, the game only follows one set path instead of multiple branching paths. In this game, Kirby can still copy the abilities of his foes - but in addition to this, he can combine these abilities with others to make unique combinations. (For one example, combining electricity and ice will turn Kirby into a fridge that spits out food.) The story begins with Dark Matter assaulting a faraway land for their special crystal. A young fairy called Ribbon takes the crystal and escapes to save it. She lands in Dream Land, but pieces of the crystal have shattered and landed all across the world. Kirby volunteers to help and together they go to find all the missing pieces. Kirby will encounter his friends, who have been controlled by Dark Matter. He&apos;ll have to battle them to rescue them. From there, they travel together to other different worlds, including Rock Star, Water Star, and Ripple Star, Ribbon&apos;s home world, where Dark Matter is lurking. To properly finish the game, players must find all the hidden crystal shards tucked away in the various levels. Only then will Kirby and his friends truly save Ripple Star.</story>

Link awakens in a dazed and confused state, missing his Ocarina and his horse, and seems to be cursed. To make matters worse, Termina, the world that he has ended up in, is about to be destroyed by the Moon in less than three days, taking the rest of the world with it, including Hyrule. It is up to Link to save the day again. Time travel and mask hunting take a bigger chunk out of the quest compared to the last Zelda. Although there are only three days to complete the game, the player is able to travel back in time after finding the Ocarina. Any items that were found and any quests that were completed are either saved or lost, depending on importance. Certain Masks turn Link into powerful characters, each with their own advantages (like the Zora Link, who can swim underwater for very long periods of time). There are also plenty of sub-quests to complete and items to find, however the clock is always ticking away until the end of the world...</story>

Our hero Link is once again called for to save the Kingdom of Hyrule, and this time he has a time travel device called the Ocarina to help him in his quest. Ganon is once again up to his old tricks, and Princess Zelda, as well as the Great Deku Tree ask for Links help. To guide him, a young fairy called Navi shows him the tricks of the trade. You begin the adventure with the task of collecting your sword and shield, and then saving the Deku Tree from the evil that has attacked. From there, you travel to Hyrule, and the many worlds that stem from Hyrule Field. There are many, many new things in this Zelda compared to past versions, including the use of time travel and the two different Links on each side (young Link, who you start the adventure with, and teen Link, who you must turn into to complete certain areas of the game). Weapons are also a key feature, with bombs, swords and other nifty gadgets available to help you in your quest.</story>

    <story>Mace- The Dark age is a 3D fighting game set in a dark fantasy setting. Players can choose between 18 characters from all over the world equipped with swords, daggers, maces, katanas and other weapons. Basic moves include- a quick and a strong attack with weapons, kicks, sidesteps, and throws. Additional attacks can be performed by pressing the standard attack buttons in different positions or combined with directional buttons. Counter attacks are also possible, but require more complicated button combinations and good timing. Standard moves can be linked to combos and each character has a number of individual special moves that require specific button combinations to be used. Battle arenas feature multiple levels and usually contain hazards like acid pools or swinging axes that deal damage when touched. Some arenas also contain interactive objects like plant pots or torches that can be thrown at opponents. The game is fairly bloody (the gore can be turned off in the options menu) and all characters have their own finishing moves (called executions) - particularly brutal ways of killing an opponent.</story>

Waialae Country Club wouldn&apos;t allow a couple of underdressed plumbers to become members, so they&apos;ve come up with their own golf game for Nintendo 64. Mario Golf 64 features an all-star line up of 10 golfers from Nintendo&apos;s cast of video game celebrities, including Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach. Each golfer has an individual set of strengths and weaknesses. A highlight of Mario Golf 64 is a special Time Attack Mode, where players must compete to finish a round of golf as quickly as possible. Mario Golf 64 features an impressive line-up of six courses, which means you&apos;ll have to master a total of 108 holes. An optional Club Handicap Mode ensures that you stay close to the competition, so Luigi won&apos;t get too frustrated if he falls behind. Even though the golfers are cartoons, the physics are as realistic as possible. The CPU calculates the exact ball movement based on wind direction, the strength of the strike, and any spin you may choose to place on the ball.</story>

    <story>Mario Kart 64 races eight familiar faces, including Mario, Bowser and Yoshi, on four progressively tougher four-track circuits. Wide curves and gentle banks mark the Mushroom Cup tracks. Your commute gets notably tougher on the Flower Cup, though. The player will have to dodge semis rumbling on Toad&apos;s Turnpike and bounding boulders on fogbound Choco Mountain! Star Cup tracks range from the icy surfaces of Sherbet Land to the lava lakes of Bowser&apos;s Castle. The true test of karting competence, though, comes on the four tracks in Special Cup. Zip through the dark caves and green hillsides of Donkey Kong&apos;s Jungle Parkway, cling to the sheer cliffs of Yoshi Valley and hustle over haunted Banshee Boardwalk before tackling the longest track in the game- neon-lit Rainbow Road. The game offers two camera angles and three engine sizes- 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. You can gain even more speed by mastering the power slide technique or grabbing Super Star power-ups. Each kart has distinctive handling, acceleration and top speed capabilities. Light karts like Princess&apos;s smoothly steer through tight corners, but run the constant risk of getting flattened by heavy karts, like Donkey Kong&apos;s. Shells that you fire at rival racers, Bananas that make them skid out and Lightning Bolts that make them small and very slow are just a few of the game&apos;s unique power-ups.</story>

    <story>You know Mario can jump. You know he can kick Bowser&apos;s tail from here to the moon, but we bet you didn&apos;t realize that Mario is the biggest party animal on the face of the Earth. Nintendo is throwing the most insane bash to ever hit the N64, and you&apos;re invited. For the first time, you&apos;ll catch a glimpse of how Mario celebrates all of the victories he&apos;s had over the years. Mario Party is unlike any other game for the N64, and it just might be the best party game to ever hit the system. Mario Party is designed for 1 to 4 players, but it&apos;s not really a party unless you&apos;re playing with your pals. The festivities are based on a board game format, right down to the fact that players must roll a die to determine how many spaces to move. The fun starts when players land on different squares, because each space holds one of more than fifty different mini-games. These quick competitions determine who will earn coins and stars, and who will go home empty handed. The mini-games are spread over eight different game boards, all of which are not immediately available. Some of the games pit every man or princess against the others, some are two-on-two, and others are even three against one. The games are simple, but remarkably fun to play. One challenge is loosely based on Simon Says, another involves a two-on-two bobsled race, and one crazy game makes one player attempt to cross a rope while the other three do their best to shake the player off. You&apos;ll find skill games, racing games, puzzle games --basically any type of challenge you could imagine. A good portion of the actual game boards are animated, with hidden dangers and special challenges scattered everywhere. Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Donkey Kong, Bowser, Yoshi, and Wario are all invited to the party, and each character has his or her own game board. Mario Party is fun for only one player, but to get the most out of this party-in-a-pak, you should play with three other friends. It&apos;s definitely the kind of game that will keep you up till the wee hours of the morning, so you might want to start catching up on your sleep right away.</story>

    <story>Mario and a range of well known Nintendo characters, including Yoshi, Bowser, Luigi, and Wario return for some more party action. The second edition includes 5 new boards, each with a specific theme, such as Space Land, Western Land, Horror Land, and Mystery Land. Each board includes unique attributes in relation to the theme, but the main goal is the same- complete the board game over a certain amount of moves and be the player to have the most coins and/or stars at the end. The single player story mode allows one person and 3 CPU controlled players to play each board. Once you play a specific mini-game (64 in all), they become available to purchase using the coins you collected in your games to play anytime. Multiplayer allows 2 to 4 people to play the game.</story>

    <story>The series continues with a set of 70 new mini-games. Play in the new single-player Story mode, or bring in some friends for Party mode. Four player games and a new two player mode are also available for play. In Battle Royale mode (four player), you race around different boards to earn the most stars and coins. At the end of each round, you face it off in one of the mini-games, which can be chicken chases, snowball fights, or various other competitions. Duel mode allows play between just two people. You still race around the board, but mini-games are only played when you land on a specific square. Another play change is the addition of another character for your team, allowing tag team-style action in the game. Story mode is essentially the same as a Battle Royale, except your opponents are played by the computer.</story>

    <story>In a world covered almost entirely in water, there exist small islands that hide huge treasures. And where there&apos;s treasure, you can find treasure hunters called Diggers, who live for the thrill of the hunt... Barrel Casket was once one of the greatest Diggers, but he has now retired. He now cares for his young granddaughter, Roll, whose parents disappeared while on a dig. He had also discovered a strange baby boy in some ruins one time, who he also took under his care alongside Roll. He named the baby boy Rock Voulnut, and Rock grew up to be an expert Digger, sometimes known by his nickname, MegaMan. While out exploring one day, Rock, Roll, and Barrel&apos;s airship, the Flutter, crash lands on an island named Kattelox. As they explore Kattelox in hopes of fixing their ship, they hear word of a huge treasure, the legendary Mother Lode, that is buried somewhere on the island. Rock, Roll, and Barrel decide to look for the treasure, but at the same time, they&apos;re going to get a little competition from a pirate family named the Bonnes... Mega Man Legends is the first of the Mega Man series to take place in fully explorable 3D, and is paced more like an RPG than the previous stage-to-stage action games. Rock can explore the town and follow the story to find entrances to the underground ruins, where in he will find traps, feral Reaverbots, and large boss robots. Destroying enemies will reward Rock with health, sub-weapon energy, and the power cores of the robots, which people in his world use as currency. By searching through the town and ruins Rock will find items of dubious use and value, and they can be brought back to Roll to be assembled into useful items and upgradable sub-weapons, although not for free. Rock can run while shooting, go into first person mode for aimed shots, and also lock onto an enemy and circle around them to avoid their attacks.</story>

Controls allow you to shoot, pass and sprint. Unlike other soccer games you cannot choose which player you want to control when on the defense, the decision is made for you.

    <story>The Weasels have kidnapped Pluto while he was wearing his diamond collar! All that was left of him was a ransom note showing the Weasels driving him away in a van. Mickey rounds up all of his friends (and even Pete wants to get in on the action!), and Professor Von Drake soups up their race cars so that they can catch up with the Weasels as they go on a cross-country tour of the United States. The Weasels have also stolen four parts of the Professor&apos;s top-secret racer, and hidden them in four of the tracks. Once players find all these pieces, they can catch up with the Weasels in the final showdown. Mickey&apos;s Speedway USA is a kart racer from Rare based on the Diddy Kong Racing game engine. Players compete in circuits of four races, grand prix style, and the player with the most points at the end of all four races wins the gold trophy. There are six initial racers, but only three sets of stats shared between them. Minnie and Daisy are lightweight and good for beginners, Mickey and Donald are both all-around characters, while Pete and Goofy are the slow but fast heavyweights. The game has an assortment of pickups - there&apos;s the Carbo Spritzer, a soda-powered turbo; the Paint Splotcher, which launches a slippery blob of paint onto the track; the Baseball Chucker, which launches an explosive baseball onto the track; and the Magno Flyer, which sends a remote control plane to seek the nearest opponent, to name a few. There are also &apos;Oomph Tokens&apos; scattered on the track - the first ten of these tokens increase your racer&apos;s maximum speed a little. As well as the main game, Mickey&apos;s Speedway USA also features a Time Trial mode (where you race against the clock), a Practice mode (where you can drive all around a farmyard course to practice your skills), and Contest mode (which functions like the famous Battle Mode in Mario Kart 64 - players must pop their opponents&apos; three balloons before they lose all of their own). The game is also Transfer Pak compatible with the Game Boy Color version of Mickey&apos;s Speedway USA.</story>

    <story>In a surprising twist of fate, Midway made a Mortal Kombat game that focuses on perhaps the series strongest point when compared to other fighting games- it&apos;s storyline. The game casts you in the shoes of Sub-Zero, and chronicles a series of events that ocurred prior to Mortal Kombat 1. In a storyline that is reminiscent of Looking Glass&apos;s Thief, the Lin Kuei assassin/thief is sent to steal an important document; this mission proves to be a test from a mysterious character (which turns out to be MK4&apos;s Quan Chi) and who charges you upon retrieval of this object to recover an ancient medallion of untold power. However once you retrieve the medallion, Quan Chi reveals that he actually tricked you, and the medallion is the key to awakening the demonic Shinnok (yup, the same baddie from MK4). You must now become a reluctant hero, as you pursue Quan Chi trough hell itself hoping you get to Shinnok before him. Gameplay wise the game takes the Mortal Kombat familiar 2D fighting enviroment and turns it into a hybrid fighter/platformer game, where you must travel trough hazardous levels running and jumping around as well as fighting your way against both digitized and polygonal enemies. Sub-Zero&apos;s interface is the same as in every MK game, with the addition of a &amp;quot;use&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;turn around&amp;quot; buttons and additions such as an inventory, and a slight rpg twist in which you get exp. for defeating opponents, which translates into new techniques and moves to execute in the game. Technically speaking this game represents the final evolutionary step in the MK&apos;s series 2D engines. New features include zooming, 3d lighting as well as 3d backgrounds and characters, etc.</story>

None of the eight cars in the game are licensed or real models but they do seem very similar to actual models. Almost all of the option and game screens are in English. The course variety is pretty varied. There are three separate tracks with some minor route variations in each. Each course has 2-4 alternate segments that are turned on and off similar to Ridge Racer. The graphics have some variety as well. The courses are- Sea Side (Easy), Mountain (Normal), and Down Town (Hard). The look and handling of each changes as well with weather variations such as rain and snow.</story>

A gigantic UFO shaped like a peach has arrived, and the Peach Mountain Shoguns have turned Oedo Castle into one big stage for themselves to perform on! Everyone&apos;s relying on Goemon to save the day, but he hasn&apos;t even noticed what&apos;s happening! Can our hero stop the Shoguns before they do any more damage? Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon is an action-based RPG similar in style to The Legend of Zelda- The Ocarina of Time. It is also the first localized Goemon game since The Legend of the Mystical Ninja for the SNES. Players control Goemon and his friends as they make their way through Ancient Japan to stop the Peach Mountain Shoguns. You can talk to characters, whack enemies with your pipe (or hurl coins at them), visit a deranged fortune teller who shrieks out PLASMA! at random intervals for no reason, and more. Each member of the Goemon team can also learn a special ability to access new areas as players progress through the game. Goemon earns the Sudden Impact power, which lets him move blocks he normally couldn&apos;t, Ebisumaru can shrink to small sizes so he can pass through tiny cracks, Sasuke earns an extra high jump, and Yae gets the ability to transform into a Mermaid so that she can swim underwater. As usual, the gigantic roller-skating robot, Impact, makes an appearance.

Oh, and Jordan&apos;s back. Like its predecessors in the long-running series, NBA Live 2000 strives for realistic basketball simulation rather than arcade-like gameplay. New moves have been added in this installments, and opponent AI has been tweaked to make victory more dependent on executing the right moves at the right times. As in the previous NBA Live games, it is possible to edit and create basketball players, as well as create and build an own team. This time, it is also possible to use any picture to serve as a player photo. New to this installment (beside Jordan) is a one-on-one street basketball mode, and a mode that allows management of a team for several seasons, including trading players.</story>

    <story>After the award-winning NHL 98, EA worked to improve what was considered to be one the most complete ice hockey games in the market. Along the usual and almost obligatory NHL roster updates, the International mode first featured in the previous version was expanded, allowing players to choose IIHF rules and rink size. Graphically, the arena is more detailed with more rinkside features, and ice reflections, player faces were improved and stand more seamlessly into the model, enhanced motion capture result in better animated hits (with the ability to break the glass with a well-placed body check making a return), shots and saves, and finally an higher polygon count complete the graphic enhancements to the game. As graphic changes aren&apos;t enough to make a game better, gameplay was also tweaked, with computer players being smarter, both in offense and defense. Shooting was tweaked (slap shots are easier to pull, players no longer skate in circles to do some backhand shots and must be facing the goal to shoot, particularly in one timers) and a new special move brings dekes, spin-o-ramas and the kind of moves Jagr, Fedorov and Selänne pull when one-on-one with the goalie. However, if the player gets too close to the crease, the referee might want to review the play in the new video goal judge, so the player must think twice before trying to pull a Brett Hull. For newcomers to the sport, a new Beginner mode allows players to get used to the ice without having to concern with penalties or an overly strong opponent. The season mode was also improved, with the players now having streaks that affect either positively or negatively his abilities. Debuting the Nashville Predators, players can either choose to play with their initial roster, or do a fantasy expansion draft. Like in the previous year, Jim Hughson and Darryl Reaugh liven up matches with play by play and colour commentary.</story>

Also, the hints about how to play each team from NHL player Keith Tkachuk are a useful resource.</story>

    <story>Adam Crowley, a once-respected scientist, now turned to black magic, has released a demonic contagion onto the streets of 1834 London. Based on the long-lost work of the Brotherhood of Hecate, it mutates its victim&apos;s bodies into grotesque nightmare creatures, and changes their minds into those of murderous brutes. When Dr. Jean F. began investigating, he was murdered. Now, as either his friend Ignatius Blackward, a priest and expert on the occult, or his daughter Nadia, a biologist and gymnast, fight against the creatures that roam the streets of London, the revived Brotherhood of Hectate, and the man behind it all, Adam Crowley. Gameplay is 3rd-person action, with an emphasis on melee combat. Ignatius and Nadia have different fighting styles and special moves. To keep things moving, an adrenaline meter depletes, killing the hero if it ever runs out. Kill monsters to top it up again. Gather special items to use on enemies, or just kill them using basic weapons.</story>

Gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor, Super Off Road- The Baja. The player races against other off-road vehicles across various landscapes, while collecting nitros and gold along the way. Gold picked up on the course or earned from racing can be used to upgrade the vehicle. Once the player has completed the circuit, they move up to the next difficulty level and go through it again, keeping the upgraded truck.</story>

The kingdoms lord, Holy Lodis Empire, is rumored to be planning the domination of the entire continent of Zeteginia. This creates concern among the people, and it is up to Magnus to rid the Lord from the kingdom, to free the people from slavoury forever. A semi-sequel to the original Ogre Battle which came out on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), and the third in the series, you don&apos;t actually control where the characters go, but you do control their actions and fighting techniques (much like Age of Empires and similar war-based titles). The main characters, Magnus, leads many troops into each battle, and you must control how each group attacks or defends, and if you wish to use straight forward attacks or magic. Depending on what you achieve, there are branching levels (much like Starfox 64), each with their own difficulty levels. The more battles you face and complete, the experience of each warrior in your team increases, so when you reach the latter levels, your team will last much longer against stronger opponants.</story>

    <story>Up in Star Haven, there exists a Star Wand that allows the stars to grant wishes to those who are pure of heart. The Star Wand is looked over by the Seven Star Spirits, who protect it in its sanctuary. However, Bowser attacks Star Haven, steals the Star Wand, and locks up the Star Spirits so that they cannot challenge his power. With his new powers, Bowser defeats Mario and lifts Princess Peach&apos;s castle into the air, taking her and all her guests as prisoners. Now, the only way to challenge Bowser&apos;s unbridled power is to rescue all seven Star Spirits, which have been imprisoned all over the land. Paper Mario is the follow-up to Super Mario RPG- Legend Of The Seven Stars for Super Nintendo. Basically, this is an RPG set in the Mario universe. Mario has the ability to gain experience and grow levels by defeating enemies and bosses. Mario also has the ability to recruit teammates to help him out in battle. As well, Mario can collect badges that will help his combat abilities, star pieces that he can trade for badges, and more items that he can use throughout the game. The Star Spirits will also aid him in his quest. Like Super Mario RPG before it, Paper Mario&apos;s graphics are very unique to any other game. All the characters are 2D within a fully 3D world. This gives the feeling that each character is made out of paper.</story>

    <story>Penny Racers is a racing game with cartoonish, made-of-paper-like cars. There are thirteen cars which you can choose from and nine tracks in total – all available right from the start. It features two playable modes, Race Series and Time Trial, and a mode that allows you to create your own track. The game also supports up to four human players. In Race Series you can select one of the thirteen cars and race in any of the nine tracks with five more competitors. You can only compete in Class C (lower difficulty) races at first but can unlock more if you finish within the first three positions. At the beginning of each race you are given the option to customize your car’s parts – parts like the car’s body, engine, tires, etc. – but only if you have more than one in stock for each category. New parts can be taken from the other cars at the end of each race but only if you are among the first three racers that cross the finish line. Also, each part has points and the sum of these points must not exceed the point limit for each difficulty. For example a basic brake part may add one point to the total sum (better parts add more points). If with all the other parts the sum of points exceeds a lets say point limit of six then you are not allowed to enter the race. The current mode supports up to two human players. Time Trial is the basic mode where you run against time. You can also load a previously saved ghost to race against. VS Race mode can be accessed only if three or four human players are selected. It has 8 tracks that are different from the ones of the other modes and these tracks have more obstacles. New Track lets you create your own custom made track. You can select the road type (on road/off road) and track type (circuit/stage). After the basic layout is selected you are taken on the “map” where you can choose from the available layers to make the track. You can also adjust the road’s height.</story>

The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you&apos;d expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill. The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect. As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.</story>

In this brand new type of Pokémon battle, you&apos;ll have to use your strongest Pokémon to compete against the very best Trainers in Puzzle League Village. To succeed in Pokémon Puzzle League, your fingers have to be fast and your brain has to work even faster. True Pokémon Puzzle Masters will discover many ways to play the game, but the basic idea is to destroy puzzle pieces by matching up three or more blocks of the same color. The more puzzle pieces you eliminate at the same time, the more points you&apos;ll score. If you&apos;re battling another Trainer, you can send powerful attacks to their puzzle board by completing big Combos and Skill Chains. If you can&apos;t clear your stack of puzzle pieces before they reach the top of the screen, you&apos;re doomed. You&apos;ll discover many challenges as you travel through Puzzle League Village, from the exciting 3D Puzzle Mode to the brain-bruising exercises at Pokémon Puzzle University. The best way to experience Pokémon Puzzle League is to bring a friend along on your adventure. Heated two-player Pokémon battles are so intense and action-packed that you just might forget to breathe! Are you ready for this new type of Pokémon Battle?</story>

With the help of Professor Oak, you will discover new places to photograph Pokémon, ranging from those such as a volcano which houses Fire Pokémon to a jungle housing Grass Pokémon. The game features 63 of the original 151 Pokémon, including favorites such as Pikachu and Charizard. Throughout your journey as a Pokémon photographer you will obtain new items from Professor Oak to help snap a photo of those Pokémon whose attention you just can&apos;t seem to attract. At first you are equipped with only an apple, but by taking great photos of various species you will get access to items such as a Pester Ball or a Poké Flute. Gameplay is similar to that of a rail-shooter, in which you move across a linear route and are only able to look around to take pictures. At the end of each route you receive a score from Oak depending on things such as the position of the Pokémon in the frame shot, the size of the Pokémon in the picture, or how many of that Pokémon are together in the shot. Up to 60 photos can be taken during each course and you choose the one to submit to Oak. All the photos you take can later be accessed in your own Pokémon album. The game features six different courses, but a seventh one can be unlocked by taking a picture of a mysterious Pokémon sign in each of the other courses. The seventh course known as Rainbow Cloud offers the only opportunity to snap a photo of the rare and elusive psychic Pokémon, Mew.</story>

    <story>An enemy with the codename &apos;&apos;Quake&apos;&apos;, which is believed to come from another dimension, is using teleporter gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter to Quake&apos;s realm. The mission is clear- take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless hordes of monsters, and exact revenge. id Software&apos;s followup to Doom and Doom II, Quake is a first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay- grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example. In single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a minimum- since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id&apos;s earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels. Unlike Doom&apos;s rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake&apos;s levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military base (with a technological &apos;slipgate&apos; as the level exit), later levels take place in environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom&apos;s colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by earth colors. The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs- there are human opponents armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player&apos;s weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel. Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical energy. Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs. The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode. One-on-one duels, team play and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game also comes with six maps especially designed for deathmatch.</story>

    <story>It was school holidays, and the Twinkle gang of schoolkids sailed to an island where they found a cave with crayons hidden inside. They split them among the group, but before they had finished, a bully came and stole the pack along with the last two crayons! He drew a mischievous-looking character, who came to life and said Let&apos;s cause trouble! Twinkle Town was terrified of the bully and his crayon character, so the Twinkle gang decided to draw their own superheroes to stop the bully! Rakugakids is a 2D fighting game, similar to Marvel Vs. Capcom. You select from a variety of hand-drawn cartoon characters, and fight using low, middle and high punches and kicks. As you&apos;d expect with this type of game, special button combinations yield special, more powerful moves. There is also a &apos;crayon meter&apos; that fills the more you attack your opponent - when it is completely filled, you can pull off a devastating special move. The kids&apos; characters are a lively bunch, full of an assortment of crazy moves. There&apos;s Robot C.H.O., who is a robot that turns into different metal objects on the fly, such as a car, garbage can, rocket, and more. There&apos;s BearTank, which is a green teddy bear with gun turrets on it. Captain.Cat.Kit is a DJ cat with slick basketball moves who also attacks with a variety of musical instruments. An interesting feature of Rakugakids is that Story Mode can be played by using Training Mode. In this mode, you select a character, and train them up by playing matches against any character you like. It is beneficial to train more, because you can choose to play Story Mode in &apos;Battle Mode&apos;. This mode automatically plays the game for you using your trained up character. If you&apos;ve trained enough, your character will react to opponent attacks in the same way that you yourself would.</story>

Effects from the damage include lesser top speed, slower acceleration and bad steering. It is also possible to customize certain options like tires, steering, etc., to get the best possible performance depending on the weather condition on each course. 3. Practice - mode where you can learn the controls and get acquainted with the various courses of the game. 4.

    <story>Rampage World Tour is a updated version of the classic Rampage. Rampage World Tour starts off at Scumlabs International where three lab technicians, George, Lizzy, and Ralph have mutated in an accident involving toxic waste. George has turned into a gigantic ape, Lizzy a gigantic lizard or dinosaur, and Ralph some sort of gigantic wolf. The three destroy the lab they previously worked at and then embark on a path of destruction encompassing the entire globe. The player chooses one of these three characters and begins destroying buildings, eating civilians, knocking planes out of the sky, and stepping on tanks. The ultimate goal of the game is to rid the world of Scumlabs by traveling to the cities where they are located. Being creatures of such massive size, there are many cities that must be destroyed along the way. Scumlabs and the various militaries make it a priority to destroy you and optionally another player that can play simultaneously. The graphics are worth noting as they are of a unique, colorful cartoon flavor. Gameplay includes players climb buildings while punching, kicking, and eating their inhabitants to destroy them. Once all the buildings for a particular stage have been destroyed, the stage is clear and players proceed to the next stage. Players can get many different kinds of power-ups that make them more powerful or restore health.</story>

    <story>While technology may improve graphics and sound, some things never change. Rampage 2- Universal Tour is very much in tune with its history, barely deviating from the original city-stomping arcade game appearing in the 1980s. Like its predecessor, Rampage World Tour, Rampage 2 retains the original 2D worlds, but improves the graphics, completely re-rendering the characters. The premise remains the same- stomp out cities and wreck things in general. Some new features in Rampage 2 include four new characters (in addition to the original three), new attacks and combos, a power meter, and bonus rounds. The cart allows up to three people can play at once and there are plenty of new cities to destroy.</story>

    <story>For years, the Toy-Volt company has been producing toys and games for children all over the world. Within months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt shot to the top! No one could put their finger on exactly what it was that made the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in the world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost.... magic. Now, their newest R/C cars really start to live! Re-Volt is a racing game where you take control over one of more than 28 R/C cars and drive on one of the 13 tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a reversed (backwards) or mirror (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from. There are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There&apos;s a Single Race, where you complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where you try to complete a series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you play with live opponents. There&apos;s also a Time Trial, where you&apos;re alone on the track, and simply try to get as best a time as possible; a Practice mode, where you&apos;re free to drive around a track to learn its structure and shortcuts; and the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect stars situated in hard-to-reach places. In Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which makes your car shock opponents nearby to make them stop.</story>

The game has 8 racers and 34 cars from which you can choose from and 4 modes in total- 1. Roadster Trophy – The player starts by selecting one of the available racers and is given a sum of money that must be used to acquire a car. There are 3 divisions in which the player can compete on with the 3rd being of the easiest difficulty and requiring less money to participate; the 1st being the most difficult one and needing a higher amount of money in order to participate. More money can be earned by winning the races and that in turn allows to buy new cars or upgrade the ones that are already in possession. Multi-Player – Multi-player mode supports up to 2 human players that can compete in any of the available circuits with 4 more CPU controlled racers. The mode allows for either vertical or horizontal split screen. Quick Race – In Quick Race the player can select the racer, car, circuit and weather conditions, and race against 7 more CPU controlled players. Time Trial – Like Quick Race mode, the player can also select here the racer, car, circuit and weather conditions but without the competition of the other modes, the player races against time for as many laps as the player wants.</story>

Shoot all the enemies on each grid while saving the humans from certain death. Power-ups and items can be picked up to increase your shooting and speed ability, and the further you go in the game, the more enemies attack and the more difficult it gets to save the humans. Options include the ability to plug in a second N64 controller for added control of the character on the game screen (i.e. two analog sticks). The brand new 3D engine, while sporting similar styled graphics that hark back to the 80&apos;s classic, also boasts fuller textures and greater mobility for the character.</story>

There was no time to tell anybody, Rocket had to go and stop Jojo alone. Rocket- Robot on Wheels is a 3D platformer like no other. It features 8 vehicles in 6 worlds all in unscripted, realtime physics. As Rocket you have to go through the worlds collecting (suddenly a dirty word) tokens and tickets and fixing machines to get the park up and running again. The vehicles are everything from a customizable roller-coaster to a paintball tank that allows you to paint the town red, or any other color you choose. In standard platformer fashion, tickets are hidden in out-of reach places or held by characters who give them to you, after you beat them at their own game. The realtime physics engine makes it even more interesting with objects actually tumbling and falling like they would in real life.</story>

The Reptar Rally lets them collect candy on Candy Island. The game can be played with up to four players (or NPC players). each turn you can move as many paces as you got on the spinner (a replacement for dice). Some tiles have special actions attached to them that let you move further or gain or lose cookies. Each Rugrat also has limited energy, when they move a lot they get tired and have to take a nap to regain energy. You can collect Toy Cards to open doors or use against friends to gain an edge.</story>

There&apos;s even two hidden stunt courses! Graphically, the game sacrifices detail in favor of blindingly fast screen redraws. The gameplay is very arcade-like- You fly through the air with the greatest of ease, and when you hit a wall your car bursts into flames. You can customize your car with different colors, racing stripes, tire rims and much more.</story>

    <story>A racing game where you control one of five cutesy snowboarders competing against each other. Being a snowboarding game, each track is a downhill slalom with a ski lift at the bottom which takes you back to the start for however many laps a track has. The tracks are varied, the first few taking place on snowy mountainsides, while the latter taking you to wackier locales such as grassy countryside, a desert and a theme park. The money collected on the course or won at the end of the race can be spent to buy better boards, which differ in stats, or to collect items/weapons while racing. There are also stunts that can be performed while racing which earn money as well, and certain parts of each course encourage the player to do so. Other modes include stunt mode, shoot mode and speed mode, all focusing on a particular part of the gameplay from the main game, and a multiplayer mode where up to 4 players can race each other. There are also unlockables for dedicated players.</story>

    <story>The Sequel to the famous snowboard simulation Snowboard Kids is a fun family sports game. It combines a trick-oriented snowboard simulator with shooting/arcade elements. Player can choose from various characters with different look and skills. There are different gaming modes, including a story mode with very light and entertaining plot. The storyline is actually quite basic, sometimes similar to the Kirby series concepts. Hence, there is no rush for saving the world, just some funny little fellas entertaining themselves. Winning a race or performing tricks provides the player with some credit which can be spent on improved equipment. Shooting elements are based on but not limited to throwing strange objects (like parachutes or snow-men) against other snowboard kids in order to slow them down. There are great power-ups during the gameplay. Courses are rarely covered with snow - most of the races are held in freakish regions like jungles, space stations, castles etc.</story>

    <story>n 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to the Tank. The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier. Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion. And none too soon, because the Invaders are back! Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision. (See Battlezone and Asteroids.) But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari. The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies. You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels. You&apos;ll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth. There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones. You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row. As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots. Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you&apos;ll face a unique boss. If you manage to finish the game, you&apos;ll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</story>

    <story>Long ago, scientists created a living space station, full of animals. After its launch into space, the station vanished, never to be seen again. Until now. The station has reappeared out of no-where, many years after its first launch, and is on a collision course with Earth. Two unlikely heroes (pilot and all-round ugly looking guy Dan and robot Evo) are now thrust with the mission to stop the station, and find out where it has been all this time. Sadly, not everything goes to plan, with their ship crashing into the station. Evo, the unlucky robot that he is, is thrown out of the ship and smashed into pieces. His only hope for survival is to attach his microchip into another host robot. Thankfully, underneath the wrecked ship is the remains of another robot, and with a quick fix Evo is now a robotic dog. As you enter the valley, you must contend with a host of other robots much like the dog, of all shapes and animal sizes. You can move Evo&apos;s chip from one animal to another to gain attributes and abilities, improving your chance of success to get past the killer penguins and rocket launching tigers. Aims of the game include the basic destruction of enemy robots, to sheep herding, controlling Evo the rat through a mini maze, and plenty more through 35 levels of insane 3rd person action. When the game was ported to PlayStation some of the bugs from the Nintendo 64 version were fixed.</story>

    <story>Spider-Man is the first 3D game to star the popular web-slinger. It is loosely based on Spider-Man- The Animated Series and Spider-Man Unlimited and features some of the voice cast from each and similar character designs. Peter Parker is attending a demonstration of the reformed Dr. Otto Octavius&apos;s new invention when an imposter Spider-Man steals the device. Spider-Man must work to clear his name and uncover the sinister motives behind the device&apos;s theft. This game features appearances not only by most major Spider-Man characters, but cameos by numerous other characters from the Marvel Universe, such as the Human Torch, Punisher, Daredevil and Captain America. Spider-Man&apos;s webs are greatly emphasized. He can use them both for navigational purposes, like swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive combat, such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web for extra oomph, or building a protective shield. His web supply is limited though and he must find new cartridges or risk running out. The wall-crawling powers are also prominently features. Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling. This is used for basic environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many sequences where you crawl over the heads of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and catch them off-guard. Combat is based around Spider-Man&apos;s ability to jump, kick, punch and web. By combining these with direction and in various combinations, Spider-Man is able to throw objects such as furniture, hurl web balls, yank enemies into melee range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things. There are a number of boss-battles as well, all of which are puzzle-based. Missions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door types to races to catch some or evade them or just trying to avoid the police. There are several side goals in addition the main mission including multiple unlockable Spider-Man costumes and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.</story>

The main aim of the game is to fly your Arwing through many levels of deadly enemies and huge end bosses with three wingmen (Slippy Toad, Peppy Hare, and Falco Lombardi) following to help you out. Every once in a while, you will also use the Blue Marine submarine and the Landmaster tank. The 15 levels range from forward scrolling levels (much like Panzer Dragoon or some elements of Star Wars Arcade) to full 3D arenas, each with a certain goal to achieve or boss to destroy. The bigger your frags are at the end of each level determines which direction you take on the universe tree, which is split into three levels- easy, medium, and hard. All three link back to the end for the final level. Multiplayer modes are also included, allowing four people to battle in Arwings, or if you complete every objective in the single player missions, they can battle on-foot, where the four main characters run around with laser cannons.</story>

The game is based on the novel of the same name, with locations including ice planet Hoth, Mos Eisley and the sewers of Imperial City, all in full 3D. Levels each have very different objectives, ranging from piloting snowspeeders on Hoth and racing speeder bikes on Tatooine to shooting stormtroopers and droids on foot throughout the galaxy. Dash primarily uses a blaster with unlimited ammo, but can also find more powerful weapons with limited ammunition. Each level has optional challenge points that are hidden throughout the level, and finding all of them will unlock a cheat dependent on which difficulty setting the save file is on.</story>

    <story>In the distant future, a small group of human exiles have been doomed to fight for survival on the edge of the galaxy. Through military strength, espionage, and deceit, a unified Terran government has maintained an uneasy peace. But as resources and fuel run short, the Confederate nations find themselves looking towards the rich worlds of their alien neighbors, the enigmatic Protoss. To further complicate matters, it seems that a previously unknown species-- the Zerg-- has entered Protoss space and is destroying everything in its path. The time for war has come. The N64 port of StarCraft is a real-time strategy game featuring three distinct races - Terrans, Protoss and Zerg. Controls have been adjusted for the gamepad, with several Hot-Key menus available, and resource gathering has been automated to limit the required number of options. However, it lacks the cutscenes and map editor of the original game. If the player has the Expansion Pack for the N64, the entire Brood Wars expansion is also available. One player can play with up to 7 bots on a random map, or 2 players can team up in co-operative mode (with the N64 Expansion Pack) or go head to head with up to 6 other bots for total mayhem.</story>

    <story>This futuristic racer has you flying along specially built tracks, jumping through rings, pulling off aerial stunts and getting up to insane speeds. The main aim of the game, as with all racers, is to get to the finish line first. But by getting some air and landing through rings, or pulling off stunts, you&apos;ll also pick up coins that will go towards upgrading your car. The cars themselves are a mix of the future and the past, with a hot rod style outside with a powerful new age engine inside. That power will go towards getting you over the line, with the use of speed boosts as well as shortcuts on the tracks helping you greatly. A 4 player split screen mode is also included, while you can compete in practice, quick race and the competitive League mode, as well as stunt modes that will test your stunt making skills on half pipes and large open tracks.</story>

The game uses a fixed viewpoint which scrolls, although characters are rendered in 3D. The one-player mode has 14 stages to work through. Up to 4 human players can do battle at once, with team play as well as all-against-all action. Hidden characters are thrown in for good measure, as are bonus rounds, and a battle to the end with a giant hand (you read right). Playable characters include- 1. Captain Falcoln (F-Zero series) Donkey Kong (Donkey Kong games) Fox (Star Fox series) Kirby (Kirby games) Jigglypuff (Pokémon universe) Link (Legend of Zelda series) Luigi (Mario games) Mario (Mario games) Ness (Mother/EarthBound series) Pikachu (Pokémon universe) Samus (Metroid series) Yoshi (Mario games) denotes any characters that need to be unlocked under special conditions first.</story>

Tigger&apos;s Honey Hunt is a platform action game in which the player guides Tigger through nine levels. In six levels the goal is to collect a predetermined minimum amount of honey pots in order to get access to the next level. In the other three levels there are mini-games like Rock-Paper-Scissors, to play against other characters from Winnie the Pooh&apos;s world. Tigger is able to jump horizontally and vertically (even higher after he has learned special skills), use spider webs to jump to higher areas or to cross water or chasms with the help of turtles or levitating leaves. Beginning with three lives, Tigger needs to avoid being touched by dangerous creatures like bees or falling into chasms. When there are no lives left, Tigger restarts at the last checkpoint that has been passed. Additionally you can find secret areas with even more honey pots, collect pictures which you can later look at in your photo album and meet other characters who talk to you or need your help (e.g. finding Eeyore&apos;s lost tail).</story>

Each game area contains a plethora of objects like ramps, rails, and half-pipes which can be used to perform tricks. Each trick you perform earns you more points for your score. The game is divided into two types of levels. In the first, you skate around locations like a mall, a city street, or a warehouse. In each of these areas, there are 5 goals for the you to complete. Some goals involve obtaining a high score, others smashing objects, and some collecting objects. For every goal you complete, you earn a video tape. By collecting enough video tapes, you unlock levels and skateboards for you to use. There are 6 levels like this. The second type of level is a competition. You get to make 3 timed runs through a skate park, and attempt to get the highest score possible. If you do well enough, you will beat the scores of the computer controlled skaters and win a medal. There are 3 levels like this. There are nine real life pro skaters you can choose to play as, including Tony Hawk himself. Each skater has their own signature moves that earn you big points if pulled off successfully.</story>

    <story>The second rally racer from Kemco on the N64 provides a vastly different style of rally racing to the original Top Gear Rally. Along with the new option to join a rally racing team, who supports you through-out each championship cup you take part in. Money raised by each vistory or top place in the cups goes towards improving your car, or reparing any problems. If you take a wrong turn and damage a part of your car (which can be anything from tyres to a full engine), the repairs come out of your pocket, so driving carefully is important. New sponsership deals and bigger team call ups will also come into play the better you race, allowing the chance to drive the more powerful rally cars and play for big money. Much like the real rally championship, you don&apos;t race against other cars in the cups. Instead, you must race the clock. Whoever clocks the best time for each stage will win the points and move on to the next stage and the bigger cup challenges. You can also take part in the usual arcade rally style against 4 other cars, with the first to get to the finish taking the points. 2 players can play as part of one team during a championship campaign, as well up to four players split screen in the arcade mode.</story>

    <story>If you enjoyed the multiplayer modes in Turok 2, then this is for you. Instead of the usual Turok single player missions, you must control your character and complete certain missions (from getting the most frags in a time limit, finding an item, or lasting the distance). Before a match you also get to choose which weapons to use, and you can unlock heaps of more weapons and character skins as you complete the objectives. Multiplayer is the main aim of this game, and there are plenty of 4 player game modes to choose from (frag and tag, capture the flag, Bloodlust, etc.) as well as a 2 player co-op Trial mode (much like the single player missions) time trials and frag fests.</story>

    <story>Turok 2- Seeds of Evil is the sequel to Turok- Dinosaur Hunter. Having defeated the Campaigner, Turok throws the Chronocepter into a waiting volcano to destroy it. Unfortunately the blast awakens an even deadlier force - The Primagen - who lays in wait for his freedom from a wrecked space craft, buried at the core of the Lost Land. Once again a Turok is tasked with restoring peace to the land and stopping the Primagen from merging Earth with the nether world. The game features an armory twice as large as its predecessor, and many weapons will even have a later update that makes them even more devastating. New weapons include the lethal discus Razor Wind, a proximity mine layer, and the Cerebral Bore, a flying grenade that homes in on an enemy&apos;s head, drills through their skull, and then explodes. Enemies have damage models now, allowing limbs to be torn off or bloody holes to be blasted through torsos. Turok won&apos;t be facing any human opponents this time, but will find himself under attack by plenty of dinosaur/human hybrids, brutish giants, and man-sized insectoids. The goal of each level is to reach the end and defend one of the five totems that keeps the Primagen captive in its ship as well as finding keys to unlock the portals that lead to later levels. In each level Turok can also find a special spiritual power, such as immunity to lava or a long jump. After finding a power, he will need to return to an earlier level to use that power to find one of the five keys that opens the portal to the Primagen itself. While searching for spiritual powers Turok will occasionally find portals that transport him to a strange place full of deadly creatures who appear to be unaffiliated with the Primagen, but discovering their true purpose is the job for another Turok. A multiplayer game is included as well, with options for between 2 and 4 players and game-types like deathmatch and capture-the-flag. This multiplayer mode would later be expanded into a full game with Turok- Rage Wars.</story>

    <story>When the Primagen&apos;s Lightship was destroyed in Turok 2- Seeds of Evil the resulting explosion created a shockwave throughout the universe. This effect nearly ended the life of Oblivion, a &apos;thing&apos; that drifts through space, consuming anything that ends up in its way. Also during this explosion, a new world was created. In this world lies the Turok family tree, and Oblivion knows that the only way the pain the lies within can be stopped is to destroy the Turok line. The third title in the Turok series allows you to choose who will become the successor of the Turok lineage, either Danielle Fireseed or her brother Joseph. Each has unique paths through the same levels, as Joseph&apos;s small size allows him to fit into air ducts to take the low road, while Danielle&apos;s magnetic grappling hook allows her to take the high road. Each also has unique upgrades to basic weapons. While Danielle&apos;s shotgun upgrade coats the shrapnel in napalm to immolate anything they touch, Joseph&apos;s instead charges them with electricity, causing them to ricochet off of walls and floors. The story is told through in-game cutscenes with highly detailed models. There are no keys to collect this time around, as each level leads linearly into the next. Turok 2&apos;s multiplayer mode returns, and includes the ability to add computer controlled bots. Each playable character in multiplayer mode has a unique set of weapons they can use.</story>

    <story>Take the law into your own hands. This game takes place in the Western United States during a time of world-wide oil shortage in 1976. OMAR (Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime) was making money off the shortage, except in the U.S. OMAR hires the best terrorist that $100 million could buy- Sid Burn. His job, aided by 5 hired Coyotes, is to destroy all gas refineries in the southwest of the U.S. so OMAR can bring the U.S. to its knees. Then later, when gas prices went wild, 6 civilians by the name of Vigilantes, lead by the truck driver Convoy, fight against the Coyotes in different areas to keep OMAR from succeeding. Choose from 8 characters with different endings with cars ranging to classic 70&apos;s muscle cars to a school bus, each stacked high with all sorts of weapons. Lots of unlockables include 2 hidden levels (3 hidden levels in the N64 version) and 5 hidden characters and cars. Multiplayer, of course, is where it&apos;s at. The PSX version allows 2 players, while the N64 title allows 4 to go head-to-head.</story>

An editor to change all player information is included, which affects simulated data- the team with higher ratings has a better chance of progressing through the next stage regardless if it is Brazil or China. It&apos;s possible to play with the groups as determined by the real draw, randomize or customize them to the players&apos; likings, mixing both qualified and additional teams. Once the player wins a trophy, the first of the Classics matches is unlocked. These are eight final matches in the competition&apos;s history which are unlocked as the player beats them one by one. Friendlies, training matches and practice penalty shootouts close the modes available. In the sound department, John Motson and Chris Waddle provide the commentary, Gary Lineker announces the next matches and BBC legend Kenneth Wolstenholme provides the commentary for classic matches. Chumbawamba, The Wizard of Oh, Boymerang and Fluke provide the licensed tracks in the game.</story>

    <story>The final sequel (at least using the present engine) to the strategy game Worms, Worms Armageddon expands on Worms 2 by improving quite a few facets of gameplay and including play over the Internet through Team 17&apos;s WORMNET. For those who&apos;ve never played Worms, it&apos;s at heart similar to the old game Artillery, which you control an artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit your enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a team of Worms, but not only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep. Everything is presented in a humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves and their cries of triumph or despair, depending on how you do. Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and while an improvement over Worms 2, it&apos;s not a huge change.</story>

    <story>WWF Attitude was the third wrestling game by Acclaim for the Sony Playstation. It was also the second WWF 3D wrestling game for the system. This game was the followup to the commercial success WWF War Zone. At the time it was the wrestling game to have featured the most modes. The 20 or so game modes included specialty matches like royal rumble, survivor series, tornado matches and more. Also featured was a new career mode compared to that of WWF War Zone, realistic entrances and a first ever Create a PPV mode. The game featured over 40 of the then current WWF Superstars, including hidden ones. The Create A Wrestler feature was one of the most advanced of it&apos;s time.</story>

    <story>One of the first wrestling games for the Nintendo 64, and one of the many for the Playstation. The Playstation version has better, CD quality music, but has less features. One of the main attractions was that WWF&apos;s Steve Austin did a lot of voice acting for it, although the other wrestlers don&apos;t have nearly as much speech. Features include custom player made wrestlers, as well as the real wrestlers, many different game types (single player, multiplayer, royal rumbles, cage matches, etc.), but the career mode is where the action is, and you can build up your wrestlers strengths, and earn him belts.</story>

    <story>WWF Wrestlemania 2000 is THQ&apos;s first WWF licenced game after making two previous WCW titles. Wrestlemania 2K picks up where WCW/NWO Revenge left off. The graphics are by far superior as well is the animation. Wrestlemania 2K adds three highly sort after features- Cage match, custom entrances and Create A Wrestler feature. Wrestlemania 2K features more than 50 real WWF stars as well as the option for 16 custom wrestlers. All the wrestlers come with their real-life theme music, entrance videos (made into slide shows) and entrance performances. A great improvement over the previous game is the road to Wrestlemania mode, an enhanced tournament where players can challenge for any number of belts and be challenged by other wrestlers in a 12 month journey that finally leads to Wrestlemania 2000 itself.</story>

    <story>Xena- Warrior Princess - Talisman of Fate is based on the TV-series Xena- Warrior Princess. The Nintendo 64 version of the series tie-in is a fighting game, unlike its PlayStation counterpart. The whole Xena universe is used in the game as all the levels and characters, except the new boss character, are familiar to the fans of the show. The action takes place in arenas which represent different kinds of surroundings with all the characters having their own level. The fighting is done with various weapons each character wielding his/her trademark weapon such as Xena&apos;s chakram, Gabrielle&apos;s staff and Callisto&apos;s sword. It includes most of the standard fighting-game modes such as story, vs. and training as well as a roster mode, where each player picks a succession of characters rather than just one. The fighting system is somewhat different from more traditional games. The most obvious difference is that four players are allowed instead of two. It can be a team battle or a free-for-all. The analog stick moves characters around on the ground in two dimensions, with separate buttons for block, jump and duck. The C-buttons handle attacks. Special moves are accomplished mostly by pulling the analog stick either toward your opponent, then away or vice-versa.</story>

    <story>Loosely based on the Super NES classic Yoshi&apos;s Island, Yoshi&apos;s Story follows the adventures of six Yoshis as they search through sunny woods, dark caves, soaring mountains, steaming jungles, vast oceans, and gloomy castles for the Super Happy Tree, which has been stolen by the dreaded Baby Bowser. Yoshi can walk, run, swim, leap, flutter, and fire his payload of eggs. The action takes place in storybook pages made up of bookmaking materials and other familiar textures, including cut-paper forests, denim clouds, inflatable plastic islands, and stacks of colored spools. Yoshi&apos;s Story pioneers use of the Rumble Pak as a key element of the game-play experience, as you&apos;ll be able to feel invisible but treacherous currents when Yoshi swims through oceanic depths. The Rumble Pak can also help you locate hidden fruit or other objects by rumbling when Yoshi smells something. With a light touch of the Control Stick you can float on a leaf, ride a friendly dragon, and tiptoe past a swarm of angry bees.</story>
