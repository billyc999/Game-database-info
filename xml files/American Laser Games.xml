    <story>The player character is employed in the police force and works his way up from Rookie to Delta Force, achieved through systematically neutralizing threats which appear in various environments and scenarios. As a Rookie, the player character teams up with a somewhat boisterous policewoman, taking on shoplifters, armed robbers and gang members. After getting promoted to Undercover, the player character gets a slightly overweight male partner and confronts drug smugglers and crime lords in a nightclub, impound lot and airport. Next, in SWAT, bank robbers and terrorists become the enemies. Finally, in Delta Force, the player must stand up to criminals who are a serious threat to national security, such as a hijacked shipment of nuclear material, hijacked planes, and assassination attempts. Each part of the game is made up of three separate scenarios, with one final mission involving a plot to steal plutonium that is filmed partly in nightvision.</story>

    <story>The player steps into the shoes of an anonymous Drug Enforcement Administration agent whose goal is to track down and detain or eliminate a dangerous drug baron residing in South America, thus destroying his illegal cartel. Along the way, the agent will have to render any opposition harmless by any means necessary, as is the case in most other American Laser Games releases. As in Crime Patrol, the player battles criminals and other villains in several widely varying environments. In the original game, however, the main character advances from the Rookie level to the Delta Force level, while in Drug Wars, he does not get promoted at any point, simply moving on from one location to another with few complex aims. Beginning in Sierra County, New Mexico, the agent continues to fight crime in Chicago, the United States-Mexico border and, finally, the baron&apos;s residence in South America. In each of these locations, the player can choose from three different assignments; when all three are complete, he moves on to the next location. The game is finished successfully by reaching and neutralizing the drug lord</story>

    <story>The player assumes the first-person role of the stranger, a nameless individual who rides into a small, peaceful, unnamed town and finds that the mayor&apos;s daughter has been kidnapped by a gang of outlaws working for a villain named Mad Dog McCree. He is given a short introduction to the aforementioned girl by an old prospector, and the possibility to go through target practice involving bottles on a fence, and some being tossed in the air and shot by the player; after this, the Prospector fills him in on the situation. The stranger is told that Mad Dog McCree and his gang have taken over the town and that both the mayor and his daughter are imprisoned in the gunfighter&apos;s hideout, while the sheriff has been locked up in his own jail by the gang. It is at this point that the first enemy appears and attempts to shoot the prospector; like all others, the gang member must be shot to avoid losing a life, one of three.Mad Dog McCree set the trend for most future American Laser Games releases, driving the action forward by having the player shoot villains, with few other decision-making situations. The action takes the stranger through several locations, including a saloon, where a man named One-Eyed Jack holds the keys to the prison cell holding the sheriff, a bank in the middle of a robbery, a corral and a jail. One must also find a map, hidden inside a mine, to Mad Dog&apos;s hideout, reach the hideout by correctly following road signs, free the mayor and his daughter, and confront Mad Dog in a final showdown, all the time while eliminating members of the man&apos;s posse.</story>

    <story>The anonymous main character must track down the wanted outlaw himself, eliminating any and all gang members and hostiles along the way; from the introduction, one can conclude that he or she will be up against renegade Indians, banditos and Mad Dog&apos;s sleazy crew.The player proceeds through the game, first by taking a preparatory shooting lesson with a stagecoach driver – played by Ben Zeller, who appeared in the role of the prospector in the original game – and then by choosing one of three guides- Buckskin Bonnie, the Professor and Shooting Beaver. Each guide takes the player along a different, unique route, but they converge in the game&apos;s final shootouts, which take place inside a moving train and in Mad Dog&apos;s hideout; the latter scene is especially lengthy and culminates with a showdown with McCree himself.However, hunting down and defeating the infamous gunfighter is not the player&apos;s only goal; Mad Dog has hidden a chest full of treasure in his hideout and it is up to the player to get it back from him. At times, the player will discover that the treasure chest is full of sand and obviously does not contain the lost gold. However, this scene which may appear during the final scenes of the game does not always occur unless the player has reached the end using more than one credit; furthermore, the sand scene almost certainly does not appear on the CD-I or DVD versions of the game due to currently unknown reasons.</story>

    <story>The player assumes the role of a Star Ranger who picks up and responds to a transmission by Ursula Skye, the commander of a starship called Colonial Star One. The SOS call lets the player know that the ship has been invaded by an evil group called the Black Brigade, led by Captain Tallinn. As the entire colony on board the ship is in danger, the player answers the distress call and attempts to confront the Brigade.The player&apos;s goal is to eliminate all the opposing villains, and ultimately Captain Tallinn, and destroy the Black Brigade&apos;s ship, the Black Dragon. The final objective must be completed using the Star-Splitter Cannon, whose elements - as well as the crystals needed to power it - are spread throughout various locations, from which they must be collected and used to assemble the weapon.The Black Brigade and its allies attempt to stop the player&apos;s progress, and the only way to defeat them is to shoot them using the default laser weapon. As in all American Laser Games releases except Who Shot Johnny Rock?, the player character&apos;s name is not given, and he is referred to throughout the game as Star Ranger. Following a short target practice tutorial, consisting of shooting at fast-moving asteroids, the player heads out to the Black Dragon to defeat the space pirates.If the player is successful in freeing the captives aboard, including Commander Skye, the next task is to find and assemble the Star-Splitter Cannon, which, aside from its main component, requires three crystals to work- the Aqua Blue, the Crimson Red and the Emerald Green. Each of the components can be found on a separate planet, bringing the total of planets the player can visit in any order up to four. However, the crystals must be placed in the weapon in a specific order, which is given to the Star Ranger by Commander Skye. On the four planets, the player encounters heavy opposition, but once the elements are collected, the final task is to destroy the Black Dragon with the Star-Splitter Cannon, then eliminating its captain.</story>
