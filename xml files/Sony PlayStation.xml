    <story>007- The World is Not Enough is based off of the 1999 James Bond film of the same name. In it, Pierce Brosnan&apos;s Bond must investigate the murder of a British oil tycoon and attacks on his new pipeline, which leads to a larger sinister plot requiring gunplay and frequent flier miles to diffuse. This version of the game has a few notable differences to its Nintendo 64 counterpart- it runs off a version of the Medal of Honor engine, and has 11 missions in contrast to the N64&apos;s 14; some of which are not shared between the two. The missions that are similar (usually those taken from the film) further tend to play out differently, and utilize completely different gadgets and weaponry. This version does not feature additional objectives at higher difficulty modes, and only cheats are unlocked by beating specific missions at a specific difficulty. However, it does feature CD-quality music and voices, as well as video clips from the movie for cutscenes. It is single-player only, and features no multiplayer component.</story>

    <story>In 007- Tomorrow Never Dies, which is based on the movie of the same name, the player takes the role of the famous James Bond who fights against Elliot Carver. Carver tries to increase his TV ratings by creating a war between the British and the Chinese. To achieve his goal he sunk a British ship with his stealth ship and made it look like the Chinese Air Force was the offender. Now it is Bond&apos;s responsibility to set things right... Most of the ten levels are like traditional third-person-shooters where the player walks around the levels while killing numerous foes. While there is an option for a free aim most enemies can be dispatched with the auto-lock function. This means if the player gets close enough to an enemy while using an appropriate gun the game automatically shoots at him when the player faces the general direction. Bond also has gadgets to his disposal which are used to fulfill the mission goals. There are two missions which differ from this formula- in the driving sequence the player chases and shoots at enemy cars while avoiding obstacles; during the skiing part he is mainly concerned with dispatching other skiers which want to bring him out of balance.</story>

You must complete missions which range from collecting something and getting out alive to much harder and complicated things. Your car is armed with many weapons including mines, rockets, lasers, smokescreens, and more. Then, if you get bored playing by yourself you can eliminate your opponent in multiplayer missions where you have to destroy the other car, or a game mode called Pass the Bomb, where you must pass the bomb to the other car by touching it before you blow up.</story>

    <story>ESPN Extreme Games lets the player access three modes of play- Exhibition, New Season or a continuation of a season. Exhibition mode helps the player get to know the courses and equipment as well as get a feel for the controls. New season offers the player the chance to race against sixteen other competitors on any of the four racing machines competing for season points as well as money to upgrade equipment. Choose between roller blades, a luge (basically a sit-down skateboard), a mountain bike, and the skateboard. The player can also determine which character they want to race with, each one having a unique skill on one of the apparatus. For example one might be top-notch at roller blading but be bad at bike-riding so there is no point choosing the bike with him/her. In a season, the player competes in the five locations - three times, twelve in all and each time the obstacles become more and more tricky to avoid as well as the other racers becoming faster and more agile. The tracks are- •Italy - Country roads leading down to a town area; •Lake Tahoe - Twisting roads and strategically placed haystacks; •South America - Lots of caves and thin jungle roads; •San Francisco - Hundreds of obstacles and hills; •Utah - Falling rocks, secret routes, and some hungry looking crocodiles. </story>

The main money earners are passenger trains, that can be scheduled to pick up passengers at the times of day when the demand is high. However, in the long term you need the city to develop. This requires setting up trains that transport resources to where they are needed. These resources are used to build houses, and other buildings, increasing the number of passengers for your commuter trains. As the city develops, new businesses will spring up, such as stadiums, high rise office blocks, and ski resorts. You can also build your own businesses, the success of which will depend on the local population, the presence of competing businesses, and even the changes of the seasons, among other factors. The stock market is also another way of making money. You can also watch the seasons come and go, with snow visible in winter, and fireworks displays celebrating the new year.</story>

    <story>Action Bass is an arcade-type fishing game that emphasizes the action of trying to catch a big fish, and the struggle of reeling it in without it getting away. The game features two game modes, which are Challenge and Free mode. In the challenge mode, players compete in a tournament where they are given three minutes to catch a fish large enough to meet the weight requirement, and this fish must also weigh enough to place within the top three of all the competitor fisherman&apos;s catches in order for the player to move on the next fishing area. The skilled fisherman who can complete the challenge mode, will be able to unlock new fishing lures and fishing areas. In the free mode, players are free to choose from four different fishing areas to practice in, with no competition or time limit to worry about. The fishing areas include fishing by the boathouse, fishing in a jungle setting, fishing by a waterfall which makes the water cloudy, and fishing while the sun is setting. When the player starts fishing, they must first choose a lure. Some of the lures include the minnow, popper, and pencil bait which each have their own characteristics. Once the line is cast, a lure action meter appears and the player has to fill it in order to attract the fish. Once the fish gets attracted and gets caught on the line, a line tension meter appears. The player has to be careful while reeling in the fish, to not let this meter fill, or else the line will snap and the fish will be lost. The player also gets to keep their 5 biggest catches alive in their aquarium.</story>

With a new character you start with amateur tournaments until you have removed your handicap. Then you can participate in the pro tournaments. To hit the ball in this game the player will have to use his analogue stick and swing that much like a real club. The game features commentary by Peter Alliss and Alex Hay.</story>

You can choose from any of the leading teams and attempt to lead them to glory, starting from the qualifiers, with friendly matches (surely a misnomer in the tough world of Ice Hockey) and a practice mode also on offer. Players are motion-captured, and the action can be viewed from multiple camera angles. Paul Ferguson provides a running commentary, and full replays are provided.</story>

    <story>Actua Ice Hockey 2 is the follow-up of the official game of the Nagano 1998 Winter Olympics ice hockey tournament, Actua Ice Hockey. Focused on a fictional North American league, with GHL (Gremlin Hockey League) club teams, the game enhances the graphics and gameplay of the previous version. While the game is unlicensed, all teams were inspired by their real NHL counterparts, from team logos to player names (using the classic trick of changing one letter from the name to other phonetically close). Features include three speeds of play, a three-on-three arcade mode with smaller ring, network play and advanced body collision physics. Like NHL Championship (released around the same time), the game adds a coloured track to the puck named GremTrax. Slower shots and passes are coloured green, and faster red (opposite to the blue/red combination used by Fox). Tactics were not forgotten, and the player is able to select the lines, select how and how fast teams build up the attack and are expected to shoot on goal and how to defend. If the player does not feel like controlling everything, tactical decisions can be left to the computer. It&apos;s also possible to trade players to balance or keep rosters up to date.</story>

New commentary was recorded and some Premiership historical data was included. All remaining aspects of the game were unchanged or just tweaked.

    <story>In 1995 the increased power of the new wave of systems made 3D football games a possibility several companies investigated. Most of the features people later took for granted in football games were pioneered, or at least fairly fresh, when they appeared in the first of the Actua Sports titles. Multiple camera angles were available to view the full-3D action, with 3 Sheffield Wednesday FC players providing motion capture. 44 international squads of 22 players, each with 8 individual skill attributes, were featured. BBC commentator Barry Davies provided a full flowing commentary over the top. A full range of customised tournaments were available, as well as multi-player options allowing for both same-system and networked play.</story>

The game is fast-paced with more of an action than simulation feel, and an emphasis on ground play rather than heading. A young Michael Owen provides motion capture to produce realistic player motions and actions - the different builds and styles of players are taken into account. 64 top international teams are featured, as are 24 distinct stadiums, with weather conditions having both visible and noticeable playing effects. This was one of the first games to feature 2-man commentary, with former England captain Trevor Brooking joining Barry Davies in the analytical role.</story>

    <story>adidas Power Soccer 98 is the fourth and final title in the Psygnosis series. Offering the classic mix of arcade and simulated gameplay from the previous games, this edition updates the game twelve different types of tournaments and cups, eleven international leagues, 120 national teams and about 30 different stadia to play in. Aside from the classic gameplay players have different moves such as flick-passes, short dribbles, and sliding tackles. In both both (arcade modes and simulation), there is a speed button that makes players run at an extreme and somewhat unrealistic speed. It is not entirely an advantage as using it widens the gap between the ball and the foot, leaving players wide open for tackles. Unlike similar games, there also isn&apos;t a way to scroll through the available players - the game automatically selects the player nearest to the ball. The camera is dynamic and smoothly zooms in and out to give the best overview of the pitch. Multiplayer is available for up to four players through multitap. It was released in June of 1998 to coincide with the 1998 World Cup played in France at that time.</story>

    <story>This sequel to the early PlayStation bestseller adidas Power Soccer expands on the number of available leagues (from 3 to 5, with Spain and Italy adding to the English, French and German leagues) and a Top 20 division with top European Clubs, as well as 56 national teams. The usual game modes and options in the genre make a presence here, being possible to play cups, tournaments or leagues. As with the previous game, the same fast-paced gameplay remains, while the regular mode isn&apos;t much different from the remaining sports game in the first years of the console, with the face buttons controlling the basic aspects of the game, such as passing, lobbing or kicking (or different kind of lunges on defence). However, the game gains a new dimension in the arcade mode, where it&apos;s possible to bend the rules with infamous kicks to the head or unleash the trademark move of the series - the Predator Megakick, named after the then revolutionary boot models. However, doing those decrease the players&apos; stamina meter, and after the bar is depleted, players not only no longer can make special moves, but also take longer to recover from a tackle, so longer games can be won (or lost) by the number of players that can&apos;t feel their legs no more.</story>

In every soccer game, there is very good commentary. In Three Lions, there is no commentary. No phrases like Owen shoots or Barthez saves. You can almost feel the real atmosphere of the football match where the players are shouting at each other, referee is telling you to stop playing the injury and defensemen are complaining about the quality of the pitch.</story>

    <story>Oh no! Alfred&apos;s girlfriend Floella has been chicknapped by the malevolent MekaChicken! Navigate Alfred through worlds of cheese, playing cards, children&apos;s toy blocks and more weird locations as he pursues MekaChicken and defeats an army of psychotic snails along the way. Alfred Chicken is a remake of the Amiga game of the same name. It features updated polygonal graphics and a CD quality soundtrack, in addition to all-new levels. However, the basic gameplay is the same - guide Alfred through action-packed platform levels and snatch up as many gems as you can along the way. Peck at the balloons strewn throughout the levels to release them - once you&apos;ve released them all, you can progress to the next level. A watering can is also hidden in each level - collect these for Alfred&apos;s friend Mr. Peckles, who is (naturally) a gigantic smiling sunflower. Doing so will score Alfred a bonus for the level.</story>

    <story>Two hundred years after the events of Alien 3, Lieutenant Ellen Ripley is cloned by military scientists interested in the Alien Queen she had become a host for. Like the Company from the earlier films, the military intends to use the Queen to breed a force of bio-weapons. But then something goes wrong; the Aliens they are studying manage to escape, and swarm throughout the science ship. It&apos;s up to four stranded heroes - Ripley, Call, DiStephano and Christie - to wipe out the Aliens, and return the ship safely to Earth. Gameplay is standard FPS action, with limited ammo and plenty of hazards to detour around or find the switch to deactivate. The player switches between the four main characters at each level change, each with a slightly different set of abilities (Call has a motion tracker, Christie has his twin pistols from the film). Levels are based around keeping the Auriga running, and making their way through the ship to escape. The game uses a true 3-D engine, allowing for ladders, rooms over rooms, and the ability to look up and down. Aliens also make use of the 3-D space, and can crawl along walls and ceilings, or leap out from the shadows to attack. Scripting is also heavily used, to set up cinematic moments (such as an Alien chasing a fleeing guard) throughout the levels.</story>

    <story>Alien Trilogy is a first-person shooter based on the first three Alien movies. You control Lt. Ripley in three sections, each based on one film- The colony complex on LV426 (from Aliens), the prison planet (from Alien³) and the derelict spaceship (from Alien). Each section consists of about 10 missions. In every mission, certain goals must be accomplished to continue. These include killing a certain number of enemies, finding items or activating switches. Enemies include everything the Alien life cycle provides- facehuggers, chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens (from Alien³) and Alien queens, one of which waits in the final mission of every section. In addition to the Aliens, you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected by the Aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your mission. Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart gun. Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like grenades and seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles and shoulder lamps (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and the motion tracker tells you where your enemies are - but only if they are moving.</story>

    <story>In Alone in the Dark 2, you take the role of detective Edward Carnby, one of the two main characters in the original Alone in the Dark. Carnby is now called upon to investigate a bootlegger named One Eyed Jack after an old detective college name Stryker attributes Jack to the kidnapping of young Grace Saunders. Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack&apos;s dilapidated mansion of Hell&apos;s Kitchen and rescue the girl, only to disappear himself. That&apos;s where Carnby comes in. Carnby soon learns that Jack and his gangsters are really 15th century pirates who gained immortality after Jack joined forces with Elizabeth Jarret, a Voodoo witch. However the dark magic which keeps them immortal also requires Jack and his crew to regularly make human sacrifices (which explains Grace&apos;s kidnapping). Now Carnby must battle his way through Hell&apos;s Kitchen and Jack&apos;s army of tommy-gun wielding gangsters, searching for a way to break the spell and make them stay dead. Alone in the Dark 2 is an action-adventure game, similar to the original Alone in the Dark. Like its predecessor, the game uses hybrid 2D-3D graphics. Completing the game requires you to solve a lot of puzzles while fighting zombie pirates along the way. Some enemies can be killed with the numerous weapons at your disposal, while others need to be defeated via trickery. Apart from Edward Carnby, the game also includes a short section (two sections in the CD-ROM version) where you play as the little Grace Saunders. Grace obviously cannot fight, and thus the sections featuring her are all about fast reflexes and wits to evade and outsmart the enemies.</story>

    <story>In this children&apos;s title based on the Chinese tile game of mahjongg, players must clear stacks of tiles by matching pairs of letters, animals, food, or plants. Each game is timed, and the goal is to clear each of the ten levels within the limit. A record time is also presented in the bottom right corner of the screen. On the right side of the playfield is the word bonus, which lights up whenever players match the five corresponding letters. Once the word is spelled out, players unlock an additional game called Block Blaster, which is patterned after the classic Breakout. Players are challenged to eliminate a series of blocks by ricocheting a bouncing ball into a wall using a horizontal paddle. </story>

    <story>Animaniacs- Ten Pin Alley is a bowling game, a sequel of sorts to Ten Pin Alley. The gameplay is basically the same- the player can choose from a selection of characters (this time from the Animaniacs cartoon) with varying statistics, or build a new character from the ground up. This character is then positioned with the digital pad facing the bowling lane and its pins. Pressing X starts the ball launch where the screen switches to a side view of the character holding the ball and three gauges appear- Two tricolored ones for speed and accuracy and a smaller green one for putting a spin on the ball. Initially, the player can fill the spin gauge by pressing both the digital pad and X. After some seconds, a fast meter starts to move on the other gauges. The objective is to press X when it reaches the yellow band on each gauge. If it misses this mark, the character fumbles and drops the ball.</story>

    <story>ANIMORPHS- Shattered Reality is a quasi-3D platformer based on the popular Scholastic book series. A quick back story- Earth is being secretly conquered by an alien race known as the Yeerks, small slug like creatures that enter a host’s ear, latch onto their brain, and completely control them. The only thing standing between the Yeerks and total domination is the Animorphs, a group of kids who have the power to morph into any animal form they can touch. In Shattered Reality, the leader of the Yeerk invasion, Visser 3, has a plan to finally take over the world. Using a device called “the Continuum Crystal”, Visser 3 plans to manipulate the space-time continuum in such as to change reality, making his invasion force the rulers of Earth, with no more Animorphs to fight against him. However, as he activates the continuum crystal, is misfires, shatters itself and the shards of the crystal become scattered. The Animorphs must collect all the shards of the shattered crystal to prevent Visser 3 from achieving his evil designs. You then control the various members of the Animorphs crew, leading them through several differently themed levels (forests, swamps, urban, factories, underwater, subway tunnels, spacecraft, etc.) to collect the pieces of the crystal. Most of the gameplay is jumping around on platforms collecting coins, battling aliens (when you encounter an alien, you automatically morph from your human self into your “battle morph”, which is a unique animal for each character), defeating the occasional boss alien, and trying not to fall. A few levels are more of a 3rd person race, rather than platform based, as you navigate a dolphin, dragonfly, bat, or hawk (one of the Animorphs in another one of their animal forms) down a dangerous path. All the levels are quite linear in nature. At the end of each level, you collect a piece of the crystal. If for some reason you fail in your quest, you get to see a movie of what happens to Earth when the Yeerks finally take over. If you succeed, you are rewarded with a nice “winning” video.</story>

    <story>Specter, a popular attraction at the amusement park, has been transformed from a mild-mannered monkey into a scheming simian through the powers of the intelligence boosting Peak Point Helmet. Now he and his monkey army have taken over the Professor&apos;s time machine in order to to travel back in time and replace human civilization with a simian society. There&apos;s just one catch- Spike was caught in the time machine as well, and has been pulled back into the past with them. With the help of the Professor&apos;s numerous gadgets Spike will travel through prehistoric lands and capture Specter&apos;s army to prevent his evil scheme. Because of the game&apos;s requirement of a Dual Shock controller, all of Spike&apos;s items are controlled through the right stick. Examples include a stun stick that can be slashed in any direction or spun in a circle, an RC Car that can drive alongside Spike as he runs, and a helicopter blade that can be spun rapidly to lift Spike or slow his descent. The goal in every level is to capture enough of Specter&apos;s monkeys to diminish their effect on history. Each monkey has different stats and personalities. Some will barely pay attention to you and will prefer to goof off or sleep, while others will attack you with machine guns, rocket launchers, and UFOs. Weapons will only stun a monkey, and they must be captured using the Time Net. Finding every monkey in a level will unlock a time attack mode for the level, and collecting Specter Coins hidden in levels will unlock bonus games like boxing and skiing that use the dual stick controls.</story>

    <story>A girl named Kukuru lives in a village controlled by the Sacred Tribe - people who guard an ancient flame which contains a powerful spirit that was sealed in it many years ago. Kukuru must marry a man she doesn&apos;t love, and in order to avoid this marriage, she accepts the offer of the mayor- he asks her to extinguish the flame. As a result, the spirit awakes and threatens to destroy the world. A young adventurer named Arc arrives to the village at the same moment as Kukuru is standing frightened in front of the spirit. Arc immediately recognizes it - it was the murderer of his father! Before he realizes how that could be possible, the spirit disappears, and now Arc and Kukuru have to do everything in their powers to undo the error, to stop the spirit, and perhaps to avenge the death of Arc&apos;s father. Arc the Lad is a hybrid of traditional and strategy-based console-style RPGs. The story unfolds as you are transported from location to location and enter battles - you don&apos;t walk around on the world map, choosing yourself which location to visit. The battles take place on a battle field, on which you can move and attack only when you approach the opponent.</story>

You control a bounty-hunter named Elk, who suffers from amnesia. On his quest for his own true identity he discovers the powers hidden within him, and the destiny of his entire tribe. While pursuing his archenemy, Elk meets up with Arc, the hero of the first game, and then both realize they have been looking to destroy the very same evil. The battle system of Arc the Lad II is similar to the one used in its predecessor- in battles you can move your characters on the battle field, and your proximity to the enemies plays an important role. You cause and take different amounts of damage depending on your position on the battle field. Unlike the first game, this one is a full-fledged adventure/RPG, without the strategy feel of the predecessor. You move through the game world on your own, visiting towns and exploring dungeons.</story>

    <story>This is the home port of the popular arcade light gun game. This home version has special bonuses and additional secret levels not found in the arcade. Using a light gun (or a mouse, if available) you blast your way through the secret base, Area 51, which has been taken over by mutant aliens. As you work your way to the secrets at the heart of Area 51, you&apos;ll need to destroy an increasingly dangerous line of aliens, upgrade your firearm, and cause as much collateral damage as possible. The game rewards the player for destroying windows, light fixtures, computers, explosive barrels, and even fire extinguishers. Each consecutive hit increases your streak rating (which adds to your score) and certain combinations of these collateral hits will open up secret bonus rooms.</story>

    <story>In the future, physical sports will be replaced by a violent virtual contest, where a lot of gambling and corporate cash is involved. Such is the setting for this action-packed game, where you act as a jockey for a virtual tank of massive firepower, called a Rig. Navigate through the maze-like arenas with jumps, elevators and movable blocks. Pick up power-ups to overcome other Rigs, or Gems to advance through more than 40 levels. Graphics and ambiance are inspired, it seems, by Tron, and place the player in a wire framed virtual environment. The focus here, though, is not racing, but rather blowing your opponent to oblivion. For that purpose the game gives the player progressively more power and versatility. Mini guns, laser cannons and heat seeking missiles are pretty much standard gear, but it also has a couple of twists of its own- feed your guns bouncing or shattering ammo rounds for added firepower, or experiment with the fly-by-wire missiles, where you remote control it to your target of preference. Shields and turrets are also at your disposal. Also, as the game progresses, you can choose different tanks (Rigs) to use in your struggle to survive the clash. The game features 3-D graphics with light sourcing and multiplayer features.</story>

    <story>The Gallic War is a light-hearted action-strategy hybrid game featuring the popular Asterix comic book characters. You play as Asterix, Obelix and the rest of the Celtic Gaul army as they war with the Romans, led by Caesar, who have seized all but one territory from the Gaul Empire. After gathering your army, you must capture lands adjacent to yours. When you attack a neighbouring land, you&apos;ll either- play a side-scrolling action sequence, your men will go into war with that land&apos;s forces, or you&apos;ll play one of four mini-games. These include &apos;Throw the Roman&apos; and &apos;Bowling for Romans&apos;, while the side-scrolling action sequences have you collecting coins and other items. If you make it through the level alive, you gain control of the land and its resources. In some usually smaller territories, there are no mini-games or action sequences, only combat between your troops and the opposing forces. You only choose how many men you wish to send to war, and watch as the battle is fought. There are 9 differing levels such as a Roman camp, Gallo-Roman village, the Alps and even a Pirate&apos;s Ship to add variety.</story>

    <story>Unlike Activision&apos;s earlier remake of an Atari arcade classic, Battlezone, this one stays close to its namesake. Take the original, Atari coin-op game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 2600 cartridge, then give it 3-D graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you&apos;ve got Activision&apos;s Asteroids remake. You are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation. Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris. The game consists of five zones, each with a different background and some with special features. Each zone has 15 levels. In addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back! And there&apos;s plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids. There are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses. There are also three skill levels. If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship. All ships features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace. There are also limited power-ups you can pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs. The game supports either one or two players. In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level. You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways.... Lastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you&apos;ll find the option of &amp;quot;Classic Asteroids&amp;quot; now appearing on the main menu.</story>

    <story>The Atari Anniversary Edition features 12 classic Atari games, whereby two versions of this game exits. One for Dreamcast/Windows and the other one for PlayStation. The Dreamcast/Windows version features the following games- 1. Asteroids Asteroids Deluxe Battlezone Centipede Crystal Castles Gravitar Millipede Missile Command Pong Super Breakout Tempest Warlords The PlayStation version features these games- 1. Asteroids Asteroids Deluxe Battlezone Black Widow Centipede Gravitar Missile Command Pong Space Duel Super Breakout Tempest Warlords Note- the bold games are those that are just in the one version, but not in the other one. In addition to the pure emulation modes, there is an option to display the cabinet art surrounding the display of each game, intended to give the player a sense of actually playing a stand-up machine. Each game also has a toggle for an enhanced graphical mode, which varies from game to game. For instance, enhanced asteroids merely has a static backdrop, whereas enhanced warlords is a complete graphical overhaul with new colors. It should be noted that the enhanced version of Tempest is none other than Tempest Tubes, a modification for Tempest made in 1982 by Duncan Brown. Also included is a gallery of game memorabilia, video clips of an interview with Nolan Bushnell, and desktop themes for Windows.</story>

    <story>ATV Mania is an all-terrain vehicle combat racing game. Modes include Championship, Single Race, and Time Attack. The main mode is the Championship mode which lets the player compete in an underground ATV championship circuit which is being held amongst the French Alps. The player&apos;s goal is to win the races by any means necessary. The player gets to choose to play as one of six different racers, with each racer having their own ATV to race with. Each vehicle has its own unique ratings in speed, grip, and armor. The player then races against 5 of the other racers on 6 different tracks. The higher the position the player gets in a race, the more points and cash they earn. The player with the most points after all 6 races are done wins the championship. Also, after each race, the racer is asked questions by another character, where they get to choose their answer from a list of responses. For example, an investigative news reporter trying to get a scoop on the illegal races, gives the player an interview, which can earn the player some extra cash depending on how cooperative they are. Any cash earned can then be spent on more weapon ammo for the player&apos;s vehicle. Examples of weapons included in the game are grenades, land mines and homing missiles. Single race mode lets the player compete against another player or the computer A.I. on any of the six tracks in the game. Time Trial mode lets the player try to complete any of the tracks in as fast of a time as possible. Options include setting the difficulty level, turning on or off weapons, and turning on or off the interview screens. </story>

The game features a Tournament, Arcade, and Time Trial mode. In tournament mode, players get to choose one of the 10 (8 are selectable from the start and 2 are unlockable) animal racers to race with. The tournament offers three different sets of trophy races; the cross cup, dune cup, and the rock cup. Each cup consists of 3 different racetracks; underground, red rock, and atlantis. These 3 racetracks get altered depending on what cup the player is competing for. When racing, players attempt to beat the five opponents they are up against to the finish line. To help achieve this goal, players can shoot guided rockets, use speed boosts, and lay mines to hinder their opponents. The higher the position the player gets in a race, the more points they earn. The player with the most points after all the races are done wins the championship cup. Arcade lets the player compete on any of the available tracks so they can practice racing on them. Time Trial lets the player race solo, trying to defeat a track in as little time as possible. Options include setting the difficulty level (easy or medium), setting the number of laps (3, 5, 9 or 50), and whether to turn vibration on or off. </story>

The Race mode is divided into three different classes- S Stock, SS Stock, and A Stock. Each class has three races. Before every race there are four different karts to choose from, each of them with its own characteristic (different acceleration, grip, maximum speed, and handling). The number of race laps can also be chosen- three, five, or ten. The player must win every single race in order to advance in the game, and therefore be promoted. Finishing below the first position only drives the player to the Game Over screen. After finishing successfully all the nine races, the player will receive the final challenge- racing against the greatest Ayrton Senna. If the player wins it, Senna will give the car he drove as a reward. The game also features a Senna Memorial Data where it is possible to view some of the Senna&apos;s career records and photos.</story>

To compete in these competitions however, you must undergo a procedure that removes your legs and replaces it with a rolling sphere. There are seven different events to compete in which are Pursuit, Last Man Rolling, Race, King of the Hill, Run the Gauntlet, Tag, and Powerball that pit you not only against your fellow inmates and guards, but against the levels themselves. Run the gauntlet charges you with making it to a goal point within a time limit, all the while avoiding other warriors and obstacles such as flame throwers, spikes, and gun turrets. Pursuit is identical, but it adds the challenge of the arena crumbling away. Powerball has you collecting balls throughout the arena and throwing them at a goalpost before time runs out. Tag has you collecting a set number of tokens that have been scattered throughout the arena within a set time limit.</story>

    <story>Ballerburg is a realtime strategy game of a different kind. The goal is to destroy the opponent&apos;s castle (or something else, as described in the mission briefing). But here ends the similarity to any other strategy game. To accomplish your mission, you have no armys to command - your only weapons are ballistic- cannons, catapults and the like. Add a bomber airship and some magic effects and you get a very strange mix -) Everything takes place in a 3D environment. You can build your own castle and it&apos;s surroundings, like peasant huts, blacksmith and so on and place some weapons. These things cost gold, and you get gold by collecting taxes from the peasants. To destroy the opponent&apos;s castle, you use your guns, catapults... You aim and shoot with an easy interface - you cannot see where the shot will hit before it has hit, so you need to shoot more than once to target more precise. You can have multiple guns and switch between them to bombard your enemy with heavy stones, cannonballs etc. You can even upgrade these weapons to become even more deadly. Be aware that you cannot fire these weapons all the time - they need time to reload and every shot needs to be paid. And what does your opponent do? Well, the same as you do - he shoots at your settlement, trying to cut you short of peasants so you cannot buy anything (you should try the same -) and then finish off your castle. To hinder him, you can disturb him by using wizards. They can send sandstorms, rain (making a bad sight for shooting) ... What does the name Ballerburg mean? It&apos;s German and can be translated to Blasting castle - Baller means to shoot something with really heavy artillery (it&apos;s every-day german language) and Burg means castle. The game supports multiplayer and hotseat mode up to 4 players at once.</story>

    <story>Ballistic is a puzzle game in which the player must place 3 patterned balls next to each other in order to clear them. It is somewhat similar to Puyo Puyo in this respect. However Ballistic places the player in the center of the screen shooting the balls outward. In Panic! mode, a constant string of balls appear and the player must keep destroying similar balls to keep the string short and prevent it from snaking around and reaching the middle of the screen. In Checkmate mode, a limited amount of balls are given to the player which they must use to destroy all the balls on the screen. Strategy is used here since the amount of balls destroyed must be maximized. Ballistic also features a versus mode in which players can challenge one another. Similar to other puzzle games versus modes, one player&apos;s success results in additional balls on the other player&apos;s screen which they then must clear.</story>

    <story>A baseball game featuring an Exhibition, Season, Playoff, Tournament, and a Home Run Derby mode. There is also a General Manager mode that lets the player create and trade players, and change team lineups. The game features the real MLB players and teams of that time. In the Playstation version, batting and pitching are both done from a behind the batter&apos;s viewpoint, while in the Windows version, the camera is more dynamic and is able to switch to both viewpoints. The Windows version is able to do this because of the Messiah technology being used, which allows for high-res Direct3D accelerated polygonal graphics. When batting the player can choose to either swing for contact or for power. The player can also choose a difficulty level for their batting. Rookie has the player timing their swing with the pitch, Pro adds the challenge of controlling the level of the swing, while selecting All-Star is basically the same as Pro, except the pitches come in at a faster rate of speed. When pitching, players can select different pitch types to throw depending on the ability of their pitcher. Players also can view a pitch chart that tracks every pitch thrown to each batter in the game. The game also features a play-by-play announcer and is able to keep track of the single season stats. This game is an update of VR Baseball 2000. </story>

    <story>Bass Landing is a fishing game that has a tutorial mode, a free fishing mode, and a B.A.S (Bass Angler&apos;s Society) Pro-Tournament mode. In the tutorial mode, players go to fishing classes and learn and practice the basics of fishing starting with casting all the way down to bass ecology. At the end of all the classes the player is given an exam testing them on all they have previously learned. Free fishing mode let&apos;s the player fish at their leisure, letting them choose from 5 different lakes and setting its&apos; conditions to their liking, and let&apos;s them attempt to catch any of the 14 species of fish that inhabit those lakes. The B.A.S Pro-Tournament mode has the player competing in 7 different tournaments by catching a set number of the most heaviest bass in a set amount of time. Before heading out to fish the player can choose their type of rod, reel, lure, and line. When fishing the player chooses the way to cast their line, use a power meter to determine how far out the line is cast, and then hope to lure a fish on to their hook. Options in the game let the player decide things such as the time scale, rod action, and indicator type. Their is also a record option that keeps track of all the data about the various fish that have been caught in the free fishing and tournament modes. The player can also save replays of the catches that they deem to be noteworthy.</story>

    <story>A fishing game with both a single and multiplayer VS. mode. In the single player game, players choose to play as either a man or a woman, choose the color of their clothes, and then choose an area they want to fish in. There are two lakes to choose from at the start of the game, but more can be unlocked by completing challenges. An example of a challenge would be trying to catch a set number of fish in five casts. These challenges are given to the player by fellow anglers, who also offer advice and tips to the player. Also, completing challenges may also earn the player new lures to use. The VS. mode lets from 2 to 4 players take turns fishing against each other. Players can choose how many casts are allowed (from 1 to 5 casts), how many games the competition will last (from 1 to 5 rounds), and what event to compete in (length, most weight, or number of fish caught). Once the player is ready to start fishing, they choose from a various amount of Megabass brand lures such as the Pop-X or V-Flat lures, to add to their tackle box. After they decide what lures they want in their tackle box, the player heads out to the lake and chooses their lure, line strength (8,12,or 16 pounds), and where they want to cast their line. Once they get a fish to bite, they have to reel it in while being careful not to snap their line by letting their line tension meter fill all the way. The game keeps track of the players record weight and length catches of large mouth bass, small mouth bass, and blue gill.</story>

    <story>In Battle Arena Toshinden eight world renown weapon fighters have been invited to a mysterious tournament. It is one of the first one-on-one beat-em-ups to feature the ability to sidestep a full 360 degrees around the opponent allowing one to strike from any angle. Aside from the 3d movement, Toshinden&apos;s game play can be considered similar to Street Fighter, but in 3d and with a little less depth to the moves. Two versions of Toshinden were released; for the Sony PlayStation and later a lesser known version for DOS PC&apos;s. However the PC version is not a straight port of the PlayStation version and plays and looks notably different despite sharing the same characters, attacks and controls. The U.S and E.U Playstation versions of Toshinden feature redone voices in English and redone music using different instruments. The lyrics on Sofia&apos;s stage music in the Japanese version, which were actually in English, were removed in the process, likely due to their suggestive nature. Sofia&apos;s and Ellis&apos; voices in the English translation are also notably adjusted, for presumably the same reason; while the other characters English voices generally match the tones of the original Japanese voice actors, Sofia is far less suggestive sounding, while Ellis sounds notably older. The later Dos version of Toshinden however, uses the same audio as the Japanese Playstation version in all regions, albeit recorded at a considerably lower quality than they were on Playstation.</story>

    <story>Battle Arena Toshinden 2 is the first sequel to Battle Arena Toshinden. It adds three new starting fighters; Tracy and Chaos with the original game&apos;s final boss, Gaia returning un-armoured and with a completely new move set. There are also three new bosses and hidden characters raising the total number of fighters to 15 (up from 10). Toshinden 2, on top of additional special attacks for every character, adds several running attacks to each character- the ability to strike a grounded opponent with new ground attacks and the powerful Overdrive attacks that one must fill up a bar by using other attacks to be able to use. Toshinden 2 also does away with the free-form combo system of the original Toshinden replacing it with a simple combo system (i.e. light attack, hard attack, special or light attack, light attack, hard attack, special). The 3D movement in Toshinden 2 has also been made notably slower to prevent the heavy abuse it could be used for in the original. As a result, while the core game play is similar, this sequel is more tactical than the original game. Where as in the original Toshinden, one could throw normal attacks (i.e. light slashes) around with fairly reckless abandon and sidestep repeatedly without fear of their opponent being able to counter them easily, opponents in Toshinden 2 are able to capitalize on individual missed attacks. As a result, Toshinden 2 is more balanced than its predecessor. This balance was further tweaked with a re-release called &amp;quot;Toshinden 2 plus&amp;quot; in Japan. Unlike the Playstation release of the original Toshinden, Toshinden 2 was not re-dubbed for releases outside of Japan. Also unlike the original Toshinden, the PC release of Toshinden 2 for Windows computers, is a straight port of the Playstation version and supports Direct3D rather than specific 3D cards.</story>

    <story>The third instalment of the Toshinden series. After the defeat of the Secret Society in Battle Arena Toshinden 2 a new group of bad guys emerges. Known as the Organization, they wish to use the Toshinden fighters as blood sacrifices for a ritual to summon their dark god. The number of fighters has been raised from Toshinden 2&apos;s 15 characters to a notably larger 32; 14 starting fighters, 14 Organization counterparts and 4 bosses. Though many of the Organization counterparts have near identical move lists to their equivalent starting character. Toshinden 3&apos;s game play is a radical departure from previous games in the series. The arenas have been redesigned so that they are now enclosed allowing the ability to send the opponent flying into a wall or the ceiling, though the opponent can recover and use the wall for a counter attack. The combo system has been redesigned again; now each character has a preset range of combo&apos;s, however multiple combo&apos;s and special moves can now be combined to juggle the opponent for multiple hits, though once again the opponent can recover and counter your combo. The games physics have been greatly relaxed to accommodate the new arenas and game play; many attacks launch the opponent clean across the arena. The U.S and E.U versions of Toshinden 3 feature a slightly different blocking set up to the Japanese version. In the Japanese version there are separate high and low blocks, whereas in the U.S and E.U version the high block has been altered to be an all purpose block and will block both high and low automatically. This small change has a notable impact on the game plays . The U.S and E.U versions of Toshinden 3 also feature new English voices for several characters and a couple of new game play modes; a comprehensive practice mode and a Survival mode.</story>

    <story>The fourth game in the main Toshinden series. Toshinden 4 attempts to return to the series roots after Toshinden 3&apos;s radical departure. As a result Toshinden 4 was old school for its time. While Toshinden 4 models it&apos;s game play more off Toshinden 1 and Toshinden 2 than 3, it makes what is perhaps the biggest change in the series; it does away with nearly all of the 40+ characters that the series has built up and replaces them with 13 almost completely new characters; only 3 of Toshinden 4&apos;s cast have appeared in previous games. But even they are notably different as Toshinden 4 takes place sometime after Toshinden 3 story wise, hence they have aged. The new cast has some pretty big links to the old cast however and many of their stories and bio&apos;s reference the old cast even though most aren&apos;t named directly (for instance Lancelot was sent to a certain French noble man to be toughened up, while Fen met a certain spear wielding warrior that his own fighting style is conveniently similar to). Graphically, Toshinden 4 sacrifices detail for fluid animation and speed, to the point where the original Toshinden arguably looks better overall. The combo system is once again redone; now the player can make a combo out of any combination of light and hard attacks (high, low and jumping) with the limits that they can only enter each attack once (i.e only one high light slash, one low hard kick etc) and once a hard attack has been inputted, no further light attacks can be entered into the combo. Special attacks have also become more special, generally being considerably more dramatic and requiring more complex button combinations that the past games. Toshinden 4 also tweaks the series overdrive attacks; now each character has at least two and the bar is split into three segments; one block is used per overdrive attack, though all three can be saved up to activate the new Kishin Kourin attack which bestows a considerable ability increase at the cost of health. A simple parrying system has been added to Toshinden 4; the player can attempt to repel any weapon based attack or they can use a special counter attack that can counter almost anything, but uses up an overdrive block. Toshinden 4 introduces multiple arena types to the series; for the first time there are arenas with no edges as well as the standard square and round arenas one can be knocked off for a ring out. Toshinden 4 also introduces a third type of arena to the series; collapsing arenas. As the match goes on holes randomly form in the arena (though warning is given as to where they are about to form). As if to compensate for this new arena type, it is no longer possible to fall off an edge of the ring unless you are hit off or accidently perform a move that takes you over the edge. As well as the standard fighting aspect, Toshinden 4 also has seven time unlocked themed mini games, that include breakout, air hockey and a dancing game. There is also a comprehensive database mode to unlock that includes detailed information about every character, sound bites, a jute box and character design sketches including some rejected costumes. As well as all these extras, Toshinden 4 has pretty much every fighting game mode out there.</story>

    <story>This naval combat game feature a 1 and 2 player game. The 1 player game is split between either Arcade or Campaign mode. The 2 player game is split between Arcade or War Games mode. The Campaign mode features 50 missions with objectives such as eliminating enemy supply convoys or carrying out a full scale assault on an opponent&apos;s homeland. The player than selects the admiral they want to fight in the battle. There are 5 opposing admirals and each admiral has their own set of skills on how they wage war. The Arcade mode lets 1 or 2 players choose their ship and then have a 1 on 1 ship battle. Players earn points for sinking their opponent&apos;s ships which will allow them to climb 10 naval ranks all the way from Ensign to Fleet Admiral. The War Games mode allows 2 players to play against each other in 26 different locations. Players can compete in these locations in three different ways. One way, is called war, with the objective to destroy every one of their opponent&apos;s ships. Another way, is to play capture the flag, which has the player trying to sink their opponent&apos;s flag ship and then return the flag back to their own harbor. The final way is called capture the harbor. This has the player attempt to drop marines, who are being carried inside a troop transport, off into their enemy&apos;s harbor, so the harbor can be attacked and captured. In this mode, players also get to choose between playing as one of several countries, or have a balanced or custom naval force. This choice affects the number of units of each type of ship the player starts the battle with. The game features 8 types of ships which are aircraft carriers, destroyers, battleships, cruisers, patrol boats, mine layers, troop transports, and submarines. Each ship has different ratings in the categories of top speed, target range, hull strength, main guns, special weapon, and defensive weapon. Gameplay has players moving their ships strategically on an overhead map. When two ships move close enough to each other, a battle can happen. In the battle, players try maneuvering a target reticule on their opponent ship to attack them, while also attempting to move out of the way of their opponents attacks. Once one of the ships health meters become empty from taking to much damage, they are sunk.</story>

    <story>Battlesport simulates the sport of the future. Choose your vehicle and enter the arena to face your computer opponents to see who scores the most goals before the clock runs out. Scoring isn&apos;t easy. The ball constantly bounces over the arena, retrieved by a player constantly bombarded by opponents. A variety of weapons are available to shoot your competitor, and anyone that takes a hit while carrying the ball loses possession, sending the ball bouncing across the arena. Taking too many shots results in a temporary inability to take part in the action while your opponent happily scores goals. Winning matches increases standing in the rankings and the acquisition of cash to purchase a better vehicle and enhanced offensive or defensive items.</story>

    <story>Blockids is a Breakout variant whose unique feature is multiple camera angles. Instead of only including the typical top down camera angle, the game also utilizes a isometric camera angle, a behind the paddle camera angle, and a track the ball&apos;s movement camera angle. The game contains an Adventure mode and a Challenge mode. In the Adventure mode players choose from one of six characters and go on a mission to reclaim 5 magic crystals. The accomplish this task, players must beat a series of stages and boss monsters at every 10th stage. Beating stages requires bouncing a ball off a paddle to break blocks, which get arranged in different formations depending on the stage. The player can also make the ball jump over the bricks and try to break them from the top down. Each character in the game has their own special power meter which is filled up by hitting several blocks in succession. Some examples of character&apos;s powers include Super-Extend which elongates the paddle, Ball Catcher which makes the ball stick onto the paddle, or Power Ball which makes ball that go through blocks instead of simply bouncing off them. Some broken blocks also unleash power-ups. Power-ups include either speeding up or slowing down the ball, a 1up which gives the player and extra life, and a power-up which instantly clears the stage. This game lets the player only have 2 lives and 3 continues before the game is over. The Challenge mode is similar to the Adventure mode except the player is now given infinite amount of continues throughout its 100 stages. </story>

However, there&apos;s a lot to do to get prepared like setting up the stage, getting instruments to play, practice songs, get props for the stage, and inviting guests to the show. Players take control of Blue and guide her to different areas around her house and neighborhood while trying to finish the preparations for the show. The main game is broken up into six different acts. Each act has the player searching for 3 different Blue&apos;s Clues. Finding all 3 Blue&apos;s Clues will then make the player solve a multiple choice question on the meaning of the clues. Some of the locations the player explores will have interactive items in the background which will usually cause a short animation to happen when interacted with. The player can also find and hold an item in their inventory which can be used when interacting with other characters. Also some locations have Skidoo minigames. Some of the Skidoo minigames include sprinkler skipping, cupcake color matching, the birdsong sing-along, a red light/green light type game, and a rhythm-based drum game. There is also a Parent Info mode that lets an adult select for their child any clue searching act to play or let&apos;s them play any song contained in the game. These songs are from Blue&apos;s Big Musical Movie. </story>

    <story>This baseball game features the following game modes- exhibition, season, training, and scenario. Exhibition mode lets the player play against the computer, another player, or just watch a game between 2 computer players. Training mode lets players practice their fielding, pitching, and batting skills. Scenario mode puts the player in a tight situation in 20 different in-progress games to see if they can succeed in those situations. Season mode lets players play a season with anywhere from 15 to 162 games. The game can keep track of the season statistics, team standings, and any trades made during the season. With only an MLBPA license, the game features the names of the real MLB players, but it doesn&apos;t include the real team&apos;s names or their logos, just the cities they play in. The game also offers 30 different stadiums to play in. During the game, pitching involves selecting a type of pitch and aiming it into the batter&apos;s box by sliding around a cursor to where they want the pitch to go. To hit the ball, batters must move their own cursor to match where the ball will end up. If the batter decides to powerhit, the cursor becomes smaller, making it harder to make contact with the ball. The game also features an announcer that calls the plays in real time.</story>

    <story>One of the earliest in Konami&apos;s franchise, this version featured 300 actual MLB players at the time, but did not feature the MLB licensed teams. Players can choose to either play against a friend in Exhibition, Season or Playoffs. The gameplay is geared for more of a simulation style of play with the players stats determining on how well they hit, pitch and field. Along with the standard modes for a baseball game, this one also featured the ability to customize their teams and choose any player to create their Dream Team. It also had a variety of different camera angles to choose from and had meters to show their players progress such as a Streak Bar that showed a batters hitting ability and a Pitching Bar that showed whether a pitcher was fatigued.</story>

As you can imagine from the name, this is a no-frills game, but it still comes with three modes, (normal, special, and quest) and multiplayer options. (1-4 players, with computer players as desired.) Normal mode is the regular bowling game, but special mode sets up 45 pins instead of the usual 10. Quest mode, on the other hand, randomly places 3 pins in the lane, creating a more strategic play.</story>

    <story>150 years ago, the legendary warrior known as the Brave Fencer Musashi saved the kingdom of Allucaneet from the evil Wizard of Darkness. Now, his spirit is reincarnated in a young, rather short-tempered boy. Fillet, the princess of Allucaneet, summons the reluctant hero to the palace and gives him the powerful sword Fusion, which he needs to defeat the evil Thirstquencher Empire. It soon turns out that the Empire is after another legendary sword, Lumina, so Musashi&apos;s first task is to get it before the bad guys do!.. Brave Fencer Musashi is an action game with strong RPG elements. Controlling Musashi, the player explores the pre-rendered backgrounds from third person view (similarly to Final Fantasy VII), visiting towns, talking to NPCs, etc. There is a day/night cycle in the game, which is manifested in the schedules of NPCs and/or monsters, as well as Musashi&apos;s fatigue level, which increases if he doesn&apos;t sleep enough. Musashi uses the two swords, Fusion and Lumina, to fight his enemies. The two swords have different properties- while Fusion behaves more or less like a traditional melee weapon, Lumina needs to be imbued with various elemental items in order to unleash powerful attacks.</story>

    <story>In this air racing game, players race planes in an attempt to be first at the finish line. First they get to choose a plane, with each plane having their own ratings in max speed, acceleration, and mobility. The types of planes include a Lightning, Mustang, Thunderbolt, Corsair, Zero Fighter, Sinden, Messerschmitt, Spitfire, Gee Bee, Pitts, plus a few planes which have to be unlocked to use. They also can choose whether they want to fly the planes with automatic or manual transmission. They can choose to race in 4 different courses, which are the easy difficulty rated Mountain, the normal difficulty rated South City, or either of the hard difficulty rated Canyon or Snow Land course. When the race starts, players compete against 11 other planes. Players can view the plane they&apos;re flying while racing or they can choose to view the race from inside their cockpit. Players can turn a guide option on or off, with the guide being on, it helps the player stay on course and not fly out of bound by placing a trail to follow. Players also have to get to each course&apos;s checkpoints before a timer counts down to zero. If the player makes it to a checkpoint on time, their time is extended so they can get to the next one. During a race, players may see an S icon that when touched will give the player&apos;s plane a temporary burst of speed. Planes also can perform aerobatic rolls to quickly get out of danger. If a plane crashes, the players starts where they crashed, but costs them precious amounts of time. If players don&apos;t make it to the checkpoint on time, the race is over. The game also features a 2 player mode where 2 players race against each other while in split-screen. There is also a time attack mode where the player can fly the courses by themselves and try to complete laps as fast as possible and finish a course in as little time as possible.</story>

By both utilizing Ryu&apos;s unique power and the abilities of those whom assist him, players will uncover the history of the Brood, learn more about the characters, and the very reason why the Brood were wiped out. Players control Ryu and his allies on their journey, each of Ryu&apos;s friends have abilities only they can use, and they will have to work together to make their way through the obstacles and enemies that they encounter; creativity is key to your success in this game! Ryu eventually is able to utilize his power of the Brood, allowing him to ascend into various dragon-like forms. This is done using a gene-splicing system that dictates what sort of form Ryu will take. Breath of Fire III also includes a Master System, which permits Ryu and his allies to learn from various people to augment their abilities differently as they gain experience; these trainers can also teach abilities to those whom train hard under them.</story>

Flying through the sky on their sandflier, Nina and Cray are attacked by a worm shaped dragon. With their vehicle damaged, Nina returns to the city to find parts, bumping into a naked young boy named Ryu along the way, who is unsure of where he is. At the very same time, Nina is again attacked by a dragon. Confused by the strange events taking place, Nina agrees to help the young boy. Meanwhile, the ancient Emperor Fou Lu awakens from his slumber in his tomb. His plan is to return to the world of human, conquer it anew, and impose his iron rule on it... This fourth installment of the Breath of Fire series is a fairly traditional Japanese-style RPG, with turn-based combat, party management, linear story progression, and other characteristic elements of the genre. As in the previous game, characters become stronger and learn new skills by performing tasks for masters living in different towns. Ryu, the main protagonist of the series, has retained the series&apos; trademark gameplay element- the ability to turn into a dragon during combat. Breath of Fire IV is rich in mini-games of various types, including the popular fishing mini-game that was present in previous installments as well.</story>

    <story>Brigandine is a war strategy simulation game set in a active world where all of your army units and your enemy units fight and grow continuously. The story takes place on the continent of Forsena where a coup d&apos; etat has taken place in the kingdom of Almekia. You have a choice of selecting one of five characters from surrounding kingdoms to conquer the kingdom of Almekia and return peace to Forsena once again. Gameplay is very much like other tactical games in that you first select the kingdom to attack, attack that country, organize your troops and repeat that process until victory. The gameplay is reminiscent of Ogre Battle in that when you envade a country you then select the towns or bases in which to attack to conquer that country. Your units will upgrade with experience from fighters to knights and barbarians to berserkers. Summon monsters like dragons and hydras to fight on your side which will grow with experience also. As with Final Fantasy Tactics, the Zodiac (a favourite of 90&apos;s Japanese RPG&apos;s) plays a role in determining every units effectiveness against another. Elements (Fire, Nature, Water, Thunder) and Alignments (Neutral, Light, Dark) also figure into damage. The progression of a battle involves sending three Rune Knights and their retinue of monsters to represent your side. Each Knight has a number of rune points calculated off of level, class, and particular attributes. Each monster requires a number of rune points to have in the party, ranging from a ghoul (15) to a Lucifer (125). Regardless of rune power a Knight can only have 6 units in his retinue. Each castle/fort/town produces a set number of &apos;Rune Energy&apos;, which is set against the &apos;upkeep&apos; cost of all alive units. In this way larger nations sustain more powerful fighters, smaller nations must sacrifice fighters who they can not upkeep, and saving up rune energy can allow a nation to quickly bolster forces after a defeat. The majority of the game takes place in 2D sprites except for the battle scenes which take place in full 3D polygons.</story>

Broken Helix is considered a 4D game. For example, if you are on the third floor, you may have to make your way up to the fifth floor in order to defuse a bomb. There is no visible time limit, but if you do not make it up to that floor in time, the bomb will go off, and you will die. There are various objectives to complete, such as disarming bombs and finding certain items, but the game is mostly action/adventure, searching for keys to open doors. In order to be successful, you must sneak past cameras and other devices, in order to find out the truth behind the terrorist takeover.</story>

Instead of having a normal accelerate button, you must crop your bug to make him go faster. But watch out, you don&apos;t want to overdo it because he will become angry and refuse to obey you. You can pull on the reins to slow down. The six tracks are filled with shortcuts and power-up items, such as missiles and bombs to blast away your opponents. You must fly through as many time rings as you can to add time to the clock or you won&apos;t be able to finish the race.</story>

    <story>This action puzzle game features 3 different game modes. The game modes are Puzzle mode, Battle mode, and Arcade mode. The objective of Puzzle mode is to increase the population of 12 different locales by creating buildings. Each locale is made up of six stages which have three levels each. These buildings can range in sizes from 3x3 up to 7x7. These buildings are created by shooting colored blocks at the same colored blocks that are already laid out in the playfield. The player only has a limited number of shots before the blocks on the playfield gets pushed down off the playfield. If the structure gets fully pushed off the playfield, the game ends. Battle mode has 2 players competing against each other to see who can build and destroy the most buildings and earn the most points for doing so. To destroy a building that has been made, the player has to shoot a block onto the corner of it. Also, each building destroyed is worth a certain number of coins. The player must have 100 coins to win the battle. Both Puzzle and Battle mode allow the player to angle the camera upwards and downwards when viewing the playing field. Arcade mode lets the player select one of eight available characters and has them battle against another player or the computer. Players try to form and destroy buildings as fast as possible, with some of those destroyed building blocks ending up going over to the opponent&apos;s side of the playfield. The goal is to get the opponents blocks pushed off the playfield. The arcade mode is the only mode that contains the coin-op conversion, while the other two modes are Playstation exclusives.</story>

There are two gameplay modes, Obstacle and Trick. In Obstacle mode, you race around a track and must complete the track in time and collect enough points by wake boarding through rings and over jumps. In Trick mode, you compete to score as many points as possible by performing tricks. There are over 45 tricks in total. Other features include several different riders to choose from and unlockable boards and characters.</story>

    <story>The Bushido code of honor governs the actions of the Samurai and sets a code of ethics for use in fighting. Sometime in the 20th century, a group of Narukagami ninja, each proficient in a different style, find themselves in a battle to regain their honor in the fighting ring. Bushido Blade is a unique fighting game, in that Square did away with health bars, special meters, and other traditional gimmicks and allowed for battles to be won with a single hit. This realism made the game a fan favorite among certain groups. Players select from among six ninja, each of a different fighting style and attributes. Players also choose equipment from among eight weapons, including Japanese swords, European blades, naginata and a sledgehammer. Battles take place in wide open areas in which combatants can run around as well as climb up and down. Some structures, like bamboo trees, can even be cut down. In the single player game, players can even run through the entire castle, picking a preferred fighting ground location. In addition to the single player story mode, there&apos;s a versus mode, a slash mode where you will be attacked by 100 generic ninja in one long corridor, a training, and a &apos;POV&apos; mode, which allows players to play from first person, heightening the realism. The game&apos;s versus mode can also be played using two Playstations linked up. Gameplay involves picking one of three stances, then attacking high, middle, or low. Directions while attacking change attacks, and attacks can be combo&apos;d. Player damage is location based, with hits to arms often making them useless, hits to legs crippling, and hits to heads and clean across the torso being mortal. The use of stances and the easily achieved one hit kills make Bushido Blade one of the most deadly, and therefore realistic, weapon fighters around.</story>

    <story>Two samurai families who date back over eight hundred years have been feuding ever since the Gempei War, where the Kagami family sided with the Minamoto and ensured themselves a victory over their rivals, the Sue. Over the centuries since, the two families evolved into ninja clans, but their hatred of each other never faded. Now, in the 20th century, the Shainto, descendants of the Sue, are in a position to bring vengeance on the Narukagami. Bushido Blade 2 takes place sometime after the events in the original game and is also a weapon fighting game without health bars, power displays, or over-the-top special maneuvers. The game features the Story Mode, Versus Mode and Slash mode present in the original game as well as a new tournament mode, where the two sides face each other with shinai and other bamboo weapons in a kendo like ring. Fighters have different styles (including some with two sword nito and iaijutsu styles) and there are many weapons to choose from (although the hammer has been replaced with the yari spear). The controls have changed somewhat, but stances are still in the game, as are one-hit kills if blows strike a sensitive part of the body. Initially players can choose from six warriors, three from each clan. As progress is made in the story mode, supporting characters will be encountered. If beaten, those characters will become available for play in the game&apos;s other modes.</story>

It follows Ray, the only surviving member of the Contra task force (who is originally from Contra- Hard Corps), fighting an alien invasion in the jungles of South America. All the innovations that were introduced in Contra- Legacy of War are maintained in this game- memory card saving, hit-points, three-dimensional fire fights. However, the gameplay varies depending on the level and perspective used. The nine levels are a combination of mostly overhead with some side scrolling, and third person 3D. For a different twist in one of the levels your character is weightless. City Rescue - sidescrolling Village - third-person 3-d Canyon - overhead Pyramid - third-person 3-d Weightless - Sidescrolling Hunting - third-person 3-d Alien Lair - sidescrolling The weapons are the standard laser, machine gun and spread weapon.

Each location has six different tracks to master with a total of 36 tracks. The different tracks actually are variations of the same track only slightly different. For example drive with different car type, reverse direction, ramps added or safety rails removed, different weather conditions etc. You can choose to drive with 1 of 8 different teams, each with different driving behaviour, providing 40 cars in total. There is multiplayer for 2 to 4 players, using split-screen and a link cable. The game also features typical 1990&apos;s rave music. When your car rolls over the game will turn you right side up again, but if your car drives into water or falls into lava the game instantly ends.</story>

    <story>Motorized carnage. Ever wanted to hit pedestrians during a race? Now&apos;s your chance. Carmageddon is an ultra-violent racing game which caused much controversy during the &apos;90s but was also very popular due to its fun factor. It was also one of the first batch of games to make use of 3D accelerated graphics (using OpenGL and 3dfx Voodoo cards). At the beginning of the game the player only has one car and is ranked at #99. The overall objective is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents&apos; cars on the way as trophies (and possibly replacements to his vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits for the player which can be used for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during the race. If you wreck a certain car in 4 races or so, you get to drive it. There are many power-ups strewn around the courses which range from useful to fun to downright absurd. Though the player can win by racing fairly and normally, most players found it much more fun to wreck everything in sight. Carmageddon is a violent game which is probably not suitable for minors.</story>

    <story>CART World Series, endorsed by Championship Auto Racing Teams, is Sony&apos;s first attempt at the world of CART racing. With the official endorsing and license, the developers were able to include a lot of realistic elements from the racetrack into the game. All of the top-rated CART drivers (circa 1996-1997) have been included and programmed to match their real-life abilities (based on a statistics standpoint). Al Unser Jr., Bobby Rahal, Gil de Ferran and many more are there to use or to race against. Each one has their own unique car, which can be tuned-up and modified any way you&apos;d like Modification comes in the way of tweaking a car&apos;s performance. If you know a lot about cars and how they handle, you can adjust their tires to fit the road (hard or soft) as well as modify their gear systems and aerodynamics. By moving the front of the car down or slanting the wings, you may be able to find a perfect combination for speed and performance. During races, a car&apos;s tire will wear down and it will eventually run out of fuel. Pit stops are necessary for a successful victory. In addition to the real drivers and cars (Honda and Ford included), ten official CART tracks have been included – each modeled after their real-life counterpart. Tracks span the United States and are located in Cleveland, Michigan, Long Beach and more. Each features realistic dynamics and road handling in an attempt to create a believable racing experience. As far as gameplay goes, you&apos;ve got the following options- Arcade, Simulation, Practice, Single Race, 10 Race Season. The season play is simply a series of races in which you must qualify and race for the cup and the arcade and simulation modes both keep track of individual racer statistics. If you&apos;re still getting used to an Analog Controller, you may want to make a few practice runs before starting a season. Additionally, CART World Series supports two players via split-screen or a Link Cable.</story>

    <story>Five years ago, Richter Belmont, the latest in the Belmont lineage and the one destined to be a Vampire Hunter, defeated Dracula in a brutal battle which nearly cost him the love of his life, Annette, and her sister, Maria. Now, Richter has suddenly vanished, CastleVania has mysteriously reappeared, and Maria, now a young woman, sets off to find Richter. Alucard, the son of Dracula, is awakened from his eternal slumber after this large shift in power, and enters into Castlevania to find some answers and perhaps destroy the castle once again. Symphony of the Night is a direct sequel to Dracula X- Rondo of Blood. The game is set in a castle which you can explore freely with many different paths, although often items in certain areas need to be found that will allow passage to others. The action-based gameplay incorporates now strong RPG elements. The hero receives experience points for defeating enemies, gains levels and becomes more powerful. There is also money to be found in the game, and various accessories to buy. In a separate screen, players need to equip attack weapons, shields and other items. Magic plays an important role, as well as secondary weapons and a large amount of special moves that are executed similar to advanced one-on-one fighting games. The Saturn release adds two new areas to the castle (the Underground Garden and the Haunted Path), a third playable character (Maria), and a few new remixed music tracks. However, it sacrifices a few of the graphical effects from the PlayStation version, particularly true transparencies. All other releases are based on the PlayStation version, and do not feature these changes.</story>

This conversion is meant to fix that, a remake of the original for the PlayStation with a good deal of new features. This game plays very much like any old platform game on the NES (specifically, it plays just like an old Castlevania), you walk slowly forward killing any demonic creature you meet. The game is mostly sideways, though you can jump or walk onto the platforms here and there. The game plays like an old game, but looks like a new one with completely remade 2D graphics, with FMV cutscenes, arranged high quality music and more.</story>

    <story>Championship Manager Quiz is the unexpected result of developer Sports Interactive looking to branch out from their successful football management series called, funnily enough, Championship Manager. If you think a quiz game may not be the best use of their skills then think again. This isn&apos;t just a collection of thousands of football trivia questions with points scored for each correct answer - that would be too simple. The football fans at Sports Interactive have managed to create a quiz game that not only mixes football knowledge but also the rules and tactics involved in the sport too. The quiz is played out like a real game of football. You see the pitch and two sets of teams and get to pick who you want to play as at the start. The idea is to pick your favourite team as the questions will really probe your love for the club. From the kick-off, you must pass the ball around the field by answering questions correctly. Below the shirt of each player are question categories. Pass the ball to that player and answer the question correctly to keep possession. Of course, answer a question incorrectly and the ball goes to the opposition. Get the ball to a striker, answer the question correctly and you&apos;ve scored. Whoever gets the most questions correct is irrelevant; the game is decided on who scores the most goals. There are over 11,000 questions so you shouldn&apos;t see many being repeated often - in comparison, last year&apos;s Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? game only contained 1,000! The questions cover a broad range of football knowledge too, from domestic to international, third division to golden boot winners. There are five different modes of play, including penalty shoot out, pub quiz where more than two can play and keepy-uppy where you&apos;ve got to answer correctly for as long as possible. </story>

Set in an abandoned biochemical laboratory on an isolated island, the two player characters, Mitsuki and Rick, are part of an investigatory and cleansing force sent to find out the cause of an &apos;anomalous thermal reaction&apos;. Progress through the game is made by defeating enemies, which in this case are alien lifeforms and the laboratory&apos;s own automated defence system. An element of survival horror is introduced through the use of computer terminals, where the player can save and read files explaining the backstory of the game.</story>

One day, Mog discovers a new Mysterious Dungeon and takes the treasure from inside. This releases a seal which causes the Bahamut to appear just as the dungeons plunges into the ocean. Chocobo is rescued by a young white mage, Shiroma, who is the only human living in the monster village. Chocobo must help Mog, find Bahamut and fix whatever has been unsealed from the Mysterious Dungeon. Chocobo&apos;s Dungeon 2 is a simple action / rpg in the style of other games in the Mysterious Dungeon series. Chocobo must decend into dungeon areas alone or with a partner (controlled by the cpu or the second player), gathering treasure, while finding the passageway to the next floor and satisfying hunger. The game is viewed from the top down as all objects on the screen move at the same time. Chocobo can equip a single weapon and armor item, while the hunger level is satisfied by eating different forms of nuts. Spells can be collected, while successive casting increases the proficiency in that spell. Unlike other Mysterious Dungeon games, Chocobo keeps his level and stats between trips to the dungeon. Boss monsters wait at the completion of most objectives. Different subquests are available from the residents of Monster Town.</story>

    <story>Chris Kamara&apos;s Street Soccer is a five-a-side soccer game. It boasts twenty teams, a choice of pitch, and five game modes- •Exhibition- A single match where the player(s) select the sides •League- played with four, eight or sixteen teams •Cup Tournament- a four, eight or sixteen team knockout game •Time Attack- where the player wins if they score x goals within a time limit •Arcade- where there are power moves available •Penalty Shootout- here the game is decided by who scores the most penalties in a four shot shootout, if the game is tied then this will go to a sudden death mode. Depending on the mode the player can alter the difficulty, the length of each half, and the strictness of the referee. There are twenty-five teams, five of which are locked at the start of the game. The teams are not licensed teams so the player selects a country&apos;s flag and gets a generic team, for example selecting Canada&apos;s flag brings up a Montreal team. The game starts with a dropped ball and from then on plays as any soccer game. The game auto-selects the player nearest the ball as the active player and their movement is controlled by the left joystick, kicking is controlled by CROSS - holding down CROSS triggers a power bar which adds pace to the shot. When a goal is scored the game restarts from a goal kick, goal kicks and throw-outs are the only time the player controls the keeper as all saving, or otherwise, is automatic. The game does have a commentary, it is not the flowing naturalistic commentary that is found in some games rather it is a set of standard phrases such as &apos;Hard Tackle!, What a Scorcher!, Good Shot! and Go On, Shoot!, that are triggered by in-game actions. As well as the standard phrases the game also has a couple of unexpected ones like What The Heck! and Punch Him!.</story>

    <story>Chrono Cross is a sequel to the SNES RPG Chrono Trigger. The main character is Serge, a young boy from a fishing village. One day, while strolling on the sea shore with his sweetheart, Serge suddenly disappears. He comes back to senses several moments later. Everything seems just the same as it was before, but when Serge visits his home village, nobody recognizes him. He hears from people that he has been dead for ten years. Serge begins to realize that he is now in a parallel world. His first and only wish is to find a way to return home, but, in order to do that, he must understand what has caused the existence of parallel words, allowing inter-dimensional travel. His quest will also reveal to him the truth about his own existence, and connect the seemingly unrelated plot of Chrono Cross to that of Chrono Trigger. Chrono Cross is a Japanese RPG with turn-based battles. There are no random battles; enemies are always visible on screen. There are also no character levels in the game; instead, characters get better stats directly after each battle. During battles, Serge and his party members can perform three kinds of attacks- weak, medium, and strong. Strong attacks tend to miss more frequently. Magical spells are equipped by each character like items, and can be cast only as many times as they are equipped. Actions in battle deplete a certain amount of stamina, which recovers as other characters act. Chrono Cross features many recruitable characters (up to 40, but not all of them can be recruited in one play-through), several different endings, and the ability to play the game again with the same stats and items from the previous play.</story>

    <story>Circuit Breakers is a racing game similar to Micro Machines and Ignition, where the vehicles resemble toys viewed from above. The game lets the player control cars (of various models), boats and submarines that change according to the track. The tracks have power-ups. They can be collected and activated and have negative and positive effects. Most are standard power-ups from this type of game, like speed boosts and oil leaks. Some are more bizarre, making the vehicle bigger or smaller, or making it bounce or fly. The tracks are organized by theme and difficulty. By winning races the player receives access to increasingly more challenging tracks. The game controls are particularly sensitive, and getting out of the path often makes the vehicle explode. Instead of a fixed camera, the game usually changes angles when the vehicle reaches certain points of the track. The camera can go as low as behind the vehicle, and go high to a bird&apos;s eye viewpoint. Multi-player mode has its own set of tracks. It supports up to 4 players (using a multi-tap).</story>

    <story>Starting out with just a single unit and knowledge of a small local area, your challenge is to guide your civilization into becoming the dominant force, either by conquering every other civilization or by sending a spaceship to Alpha Centauri. As you&apos;d imagine, a lot of challenges come into such a task. You must locate cities so as to make use of food, construction and trade resources, which can be later improved by constructing irrigation, roads, mines, railroads, and farmland. Each city can construct one item at a time - civilian and military units, buildings or Wonders of the World (there are 28 of these across the different eras of the game, and each can be possessed by only one city). The buildings and wonders have different effects - most buildings and some wonders improve defenses, scientific research, trade or food output, but most wonders offer unique advantages that can be used to great strategic effect. There are over 100 scientific advancements in the game, and most require prerequisites before they can be researched. How quickly this happens depends on your scientific output, which must be traded off against financial and military concerns. Combat can occur in cities or in the open terrain - things like forests and mountains give the defense an advantage. Unlike in the original Civilization, fights aren&apos;t always won outright - most times the winning unit will be damaged, reducing its movement speed and attacking prowess until it&apos;s repaired, but the losing unit always disappears from game. If multiple units are in a square that come sunder attack, the strongest unit fights - unless it is a city or Fortress, all units will be lost if the fight is lost. Once a city has no defensive units left, it can be captured. Certain units have the ability to cover all squares as fast as if they were roads, only a few can see submarines, and air units require re-fueling in a friendly city. There are up to 6 other Civilizations in the game, and keeping good diplomatic relations with these is crucial. At times you may want to trade knowledge or pool military resources with a neighbor - at others they may want to destroy you. If you make deals and go back on them your reputation is affected.</story>

    <story>Cleopatra Fortune is a falling-block puzzle converted from the 1996 Taito coin-op and featuring a cutesy anime Egyptian theme. Groups of stones and gems of different shapes fall from the top of a well. Gems can be cleared by enclosing them within a group of stones, and stones can be cleared by making complete rows from them. Blocks will fall when those under them are cleared, which can create chains for more points. The game includes three different play modes. First is a standard endless mode where play continues until the player is overwhelmed by the blocks. Second is a versus mode for two players. Last is a puzzle mode where the player is given a set field, a set sequence of drops, and a specific goal such as clearing all the gems or achieving a chain of a certain length. The puzzle mode has the player rescuing Cleopatra&apos;s friends who have been trapped in a pyramid by the evil Sphinx.</story>

    <story>After the first Colony Wars game, the Earth Empire was defeated... and the remnants of this regime sealed inside of the Sol System, cut off from the rest of the galaxy by some unknown technology. Within Sol, the Earth Empire civilization has fallen apart. Various tribes and factions, warring with one another have left the once great home system of humanity a wreck of salvage and waste from used up resources. One leader however, a Commander Kron, seeks to unite the warring clans under a banner of vengeance... and together find some way to break out from this solar prison. The game is space combat, done from a cockpit view. Different combinations of weapons can be equipped on your space fighter prior to launch. Missions take place in space as well as inside planet atmospheres. Various buttons cycle weapons, activate tractor beams, communicate responses and navigate your ship. In typical space combat fashion, you are equipped with 360 degrees of movement as well as thrust and braking options. The game does not feature realistic inertia and objects will gradually slow in space.</story>

After a key victory, it is shown that the Empire&apos;s Navy can be harmed and the ranks of the League begin to swell. Colony Wars is a combat fighter game set in space.

At the most basic, purple lasers must drain a target&apos;s shields, followed by switching to red lasers to destroy them. The game features advanced lighting and particle effects for the Playstation, as well as a basic simulation of Newtonian physics. Thrusters are only active for as long as the accelerate button is held down. The player can burst fire their thrusters and drift, allowing for some advanced maneuvers.

Graphics feature a polygonal stadium with sprite (2D) players. Gameplay features a typical two-button layout, with one button to play low balls and other to kick higher balls (including crosses and shooting on goal), and by holding both the player can sprint, making him much harder to stop. It&apos;s possible to score goals from most situations, from distance kicks, crosses, outpacing the goalkeeper and from dead ball situations, where the player can also tweak player positions in a blackboard.</story>

    <story>Constructor gives the player the chance to run a construction company in a place where real estate is up for those who want to develop it first and where everything is allowed to get rid of the competition. Starting in a single plot of land with the headquarters, a construction team (composed by a foreman and one to five workers) and a repairman, the player must start by building a wood mill and provide housing to the bottom of the social ladder- slobs. From there, taking advantage of their fast reproduction rate, the player can train new workers, and as soon as three different wooden huts are available, the council will allow the construction of a cement yard, which in turn allow the construction of better buildings. However, slobs wouldn&apos;t appreciate living in such luxury, and so a gadget factory can be built so that computers are distributed to their houses, allowing for a new generation of better educated citizens. While the workers pack a nasty punch when in a large group, violence should be left to the professionals. After building a Pizza Parlor, the player is allowed to use the services of gangsters. These are able to take on that pesky foreman or that building the Council asked to get rid off. But there&apos;s more to the game than build from ghetto houses to luxury buildings, and as they say, all is fair in war, and construction IS war. The player can send his foremen to capture other teams&apos; buildings, or do even worse- provide housing for the scum of society. From hippies to ghosts, these can do a number on the other teams&apos; properties. Want to stress out a tenant? Send the thugs to do a wild party in their house. Need some cash or materials? Send the thief to relieve a team from them. All this while avoiding the others do the same on you by assigning police patrol to key areas. As time passes, it pays out to build other, more friendly, buildings. A school allows everyone to breed more civilized members of the society, the hospital allows recovery of wounds much faster or the park, where everyone goes to relax a little, among others. Improving the rooms and giving them garden furniture is also a good way of keeping tenants happy, but jealously can grow among neighbors. Failing to comply to tenants requests and demands will quickly turn the Council against the player. The player will have to balance the output of their tenants to achieve success- overdoing one of the elements will take a dent on the bank account (leading to bankruptcy), cut the arrival of new workers (putting a strain of existing teams), replacement for deceased tenants (leaving houses vacant that eventually decay into a flaming pile of rubble not before giant cockroaches settle in) or police and mob favors (to patrol areas against undesirables and gangster actions). The difficulty level affect what maps can be selected, but also which actions the undesirables can perform. To choose higher difficulty settings, more computer players (up to three) must be activated.</story>

    <story>Contender is an arcade-style boxing game which features an Exhibition mode, a VS. mode, a Main Event mode, and a Tournament mode. The exhibition mode lets the player pick a boxer and fight a computer boxer. The VS. mode lets two players slug it out in the boxing ring against each other. The tournament mode lets the player compete in a tournament. The Main Event mode lets the player pick one of eight different boxers, each with their own set of skills (life, power, speed and endurance), and work their way through the ranks (Local, National and World) by defeating 40 different boxers in order to win the World Championship. If the player is good enough to actually win the World Championship, they then have to defend their belt against numerous challengers. Players can improve their skills by winning matches and training between matches by sparring with their trainer. Advancing through this mode also unlocks boxers for the exhibition mode. In the ring, each boxer can throw punches like jabs, upper-cuts, hooks, and crosses, and is also able to duck and weave and block high and low while on defense.</story>

    <story>Contender 2 is an arcade-style boxing game. It does not claim to be a realistic simulation in any way. It is meant to be easy to pick up and learn. It boasts a starting cast of about 10 characters with about 10 other secret characters that can be unlocked by playing throgh the single-player Main Event mode. Each character has a standard set of punches, a set of special punches specific to each character, and a special 5-punch combo attack. There are two play modes, Main Event and Exhibition. Main Event is a single-player career mode. When playing through Main Event mode, you only start with one special punch and you get trained to learn the other special punches as you win matches. In Exhibition you can pit any two unlocked fighters against each other in a one player or two player match.</story>

Unlike the original Contra and follow-ups, this is an overhead-view 2D shooter (with 3D graphics) that plays more like a side-scrolling Commando or Mercs. The graphics are truly 3D; an option allows you to view them as red/blue images, and some packages of Contra- LoW come with 3D glasses to garner full enjoyment of the feature. Hidden within the game – accessible on a certain level and through a secret code – are a mini-version of Gyruss and a Pac-Man-like game called Pactank.</story>

When you catch enough air, you grab your board, twist, and land a perfect trick. Choose from several different riders and 10 boards, and then hit one of the five courses. On each track you can earn three different trophies- one trophy is awarded for getting down the hill in the quickest time; catch big air to pull off big tricks to earn the highest trick point trophy; or win the final trophy by getting the highest total score, which is based on both time and trick points. If the competition seems a little rough, race against the ghost from your last run and find a smoother line down the mountain.</story>

Imagine riding down the slopes, avoiding the trees and trying to hit the jumps. When you catch enough air, you grab your board, twist, and land a perfect 360 mute. Choose from 7 different riders and 18 boards, then hit one of more than 10 courses to compete in freestyle mode, where the score is based on speed and tricks; or just concentrate on pulling off tricks in the big air and halfpipe modes. For those who want to test all of their skills, try the Competition mode and compete in all three events. When competition gets to be too much, try the unscored Board Park mode to practice all of your moves. The game features a range of 2 player modes; either in split-screen mode, or via the PlayStation&apos;s link cable.</story>

Negotiations yield no result and the only hope is lieutenant Jack Morton, part of the original escort, who manages to sneak back on the train. His job is to take back control of the armoured train, stop the terrorists from deploying a nuclear weapon and rescue the hostages. The game is played as a third-person shooter, but also introduces stealth elements, puzzle-solving and driving sequences with the train. The different compartments of the train form the levels. Next to regular movement, Jack can dash and use a search function that allows him to peek around corners and into rooms. Morton is in touch with the headquarters and also collects information about the organization on his way. The game uses an intelligent targeting system where the cross-hair changes colour based on the viewing angle. Shooting from a difficult position will do little damage, while open shots have a larger chance of hitting enemies. While progressing, the storyline is explained further. Other important characters include agent Christina Wayborn, terrorist leader Boris Zugoski and computer technician Billy MacGuire.</story>

As in the previous titles, the player controls a fairy named Scrubby, who acts through the cursor issuing orders to the Norns when used over interactive portions of the scenery. Like in other life simulation games with artificial intelligence, the creatures can&apos;t be commanded directly and must learn behavior patterns through repeated actions. The Norns can get sick or exhausted and eventually die, and one of the main tasks is to manage the colony to avoid their demise, ensuring that all its inhabitants are well-fed and healthy by eating fruits and consuming medicinal herbs. A series of meters at the bottom of the screen show the population status. The game takes place in space, inside a giant station with a domed ceiling protecting a closed ecosystem. The main objective is to open all the rooms, by ordering a Norn to carry a key to unlock a door or passage. Deeper levels have aggressive enemies and poisonous plants that have to be avoided by the Norns. There are blue stars scattered throughout the scenery, and the creatures can be trained to fetch and store them inside a machine, generating a new key after twenty-five stars. Norns can breed and lay eggs, producing offspring that takes some minutes to reach maturity.</story>

    <story>Crisis Beat is your typical 3D side-scrolling game, but with more features. It has rendered cinematics and real-time 3D scenes. The characters have their own voices, and their designs gives them an anime look. Also, you get to choose your character from 2 pairs, so their story begins differently. The story takes place aboard a ship called the Princess of the Fearless, which gets sea-jacked by a group of Terrorists, led by Colonel Whigen. Your character will then have to fight through the different areas aboard the ship in an attempt to stop the Terrorists. The fighting heavily emphasizes combos and air juggles, and the use of background objects to attack your opponents, in a totally different way to most beat &apos;em ups. Also, the new Lock-On Counter system separates the game from the normal beat&apos;em ups.</story>

    <story>Criticom is a one-on-one fighting game where 8 diverse fighters from across the galaxy vie for a crystal artifact. The game features a sci-fi backstory that involves mystery and intrigue surrounding the crystal and each of the 8 fighters is given a unique storyline to explain why he or she is so interested in the artifact. Among the colorful characters are a giant lizard man named Gorm, a ninja lady named Yenji, a killing robot named S.I.D., and a mysterious vampire-like creature named Demonica who places little value on clothing. The fighting action takes place on a round, elevated platform. Each fighter begins the fight with a full power meter and one power meter refill in reserve that is activated when the primary meter is depleted. Thus, there are no rounds. The fight runs until one fighter is knocked out (no more power in their meter), one is knocked out of the arena (or steps/jumps out), or the time runs out.</story>

    <story>In Crossroad Crisis you have to help a chicken get home to his family. The game is somewhat similar to Pipe Mania. The playing field is a 6x6 grid over a pond, and you have to move around and rotate tiles so that the chicken doesn&apos;t fall into the water. Each tile is a part of the path that the chicken will walk. They come in these different shapes- curved road, straight road and crossroad. In total there&apos;s 10 stages in the game. A stage is completed when you have cleared a number of tiles (which increases for each stage). The tiles will be cleared when the chicken walks over two or more tiles of the same color. Once the clear quota has been reached, a buoy will be placed on the playing field. To end the stage you have to put the buoy at the end of the path so that the chicken can walk into it.</story>

You are used to orders of hunting down the Resistance, a ragtag band of rebels committing sabotage and other acts of terrorism against the WEC, but slowly, you realized the WEC is not quite what it appears to be... then one day you and two other Silencers, your best buddies, were ambushed by a WEC mech patrol when it was supposed to be a routine mission. You alone survived. It is clear that the Silencer is being silenced... and the only place to turn is the Resistance... Crusader- No Remorse is the first in the series, which is best described as a 2D isometric shooter. Your silencer can roll left, roll right, kneel, jump, run, and perform other acrobatic moves. You get plenty of different weapons, from assault rifles and shotguns to grenade launchers and lasers, to really exotic weapons like microwave cannon, EMP discharger, and even plasma cannons. You&apos;re up against the full military might of the WEC, from simple guards to full-fledged Guardmechs and elite forces (though none are quite as good as you). You can find supplies and money off of killed enemies (if you left a body, that is, and some of the extreme weapons don&apos;t). You&apos;ll often need to bypass traps, open doors, disable alarms, take out security cameras, and more. The action is intense, and there&apos;s usually a bit of puzzle involved. It&apos;s often a matter of exploring the map to find a switch or a terminal with the code that&apos;ll let you access another part or another level of the map. Between missions you can chat in the Resistance base and/or buy/sell weapons. You can also find recharge stations to replenish your energy and health (you can also find batteries and first aid kits too). The missions range from simple sabotage to rescue.</story>

You move through the 3D levels on a predetermined path and shoot at skeletons, zombies, spiders, demons and other foul beasts. Your standard weapon is a shotgun, but you can gain additional weapons like gatling guns and grenade throwers. Some enemies throw projectiles like knives or bones at you, so be sure to aim at those as well. If the screen becomes too crowded, clear it with a smartbomb. At the end of some acts, you can choose from one of two paths through the next act, giving you different ways of completing a stage. At the end of each stage, a boss enemy awaits.</story>

    <story>CT Special Forces is a side scrolling platform shooter that has a superficial similarity to the games of the Metal Slug series. The player controls an operative of a counter-terrorist force on a mission around the globe to stop terrorist activity and arrest its leaders. The digital pad moves the character, while the B button shoots the weapon and the A button makes the character jump. The character can&apos;t shoot downwards. The L trigger cycles through the inventory (displayed on the top-left corner of the screen) and the R trigger throws grenades (when they are available). By selecting an ammunition type, the character uses the corresponding weapon (gas canisters for the flamethrower, machine gun pents for that weapon, etc). The default rifle has an infinite number of bullets. Other items include a grappling rope and a pair of handcuffs to arrest surrended enemies. Ammunition and health packs are scattered throughout the levels, as are proximity mines and assorted enemies. The regular gameplay is occasionally broke by mini-games and entirely different sections- when the character collides with a reticule placard, the game switches to a first-person shooting gallery where the player has to shoot down a certain number of terrorists and rescue the hostages. When colliding with a parachute, two gauges with a red line on the middle appear on the screen. The one on the left measures the position of the falling character and the one on the right measures height. The character must be guided to the right spot, and the shooting button must be pressed when both gauges reach the red bar. Some mission stages change the game to a vertical shooter that recalls Tiger-Heli and similar games, where the player controls a helicopter viewed from the top. The game has 4 missions, each with its own theme- snow mountain, desert, jungle and a city. A password system is provided (the password is displayed after the completion of every mission).</story>

    <story>CT Special Forces- Back to Hell is the sequel to CT Special Forces and the story picks up right where the last game ended. Having destroyed the terrorist group Network the CT Special Forces are going back to do training missions, but more and more reports about new terror threats keep popping up. Could this be a new terrorist organization, or maybe Network is back for a second round? It&apos;s up to the CT Special Forces to stop the treat of terrorism once again! The game plays in 5 different game modes. The majority is made up of side scrolling platform action, somewhat similar to the Metal Slug games, where you pick up various weapons, grenades and even a tank to squash the terrorist threat. Every now and then you&apos;ll come across a wooden sign with a cross-hair on it. Doing so will change the game into first person view, where you have to shoot terrorists and save hostages. Sometimes you&apos;ll find a parachute pack, and you&apos;ll have to play a mini game where you have to make two meters align to make a drop successfully with your parachute. There are also two kinds of helicopter stages. One is a top down shoot&apos;em up, where you have to bomb land targets and gun down enemy helicopters. The other one is a side scrolling chopper rescue game, where you have to save hostages and bring them to your base, while gunning down enemies across the stage.</story>

    <story>The story begins in 1997. It&apos;s the dead of night in the city of Los Angeles, and there has been a mass murder at a general hospital on the outskirts of downtown. The perpetrator is the director of the hospital, Richter Harris. He has shut himself up in the hospital and taken a number of patients as hostages, leaving the police helpless and unable to move in. Richter&apos;s only daughter, Laura Harris, after hearing the situation, rushes to Los Angeles from San Francisco, and drives alone to the tragic scene at the hospital ground. Upon entering the hospital Laura finds herself transported to an old mansion, while the disembodied voice of her father pleads with her to leave. Nevertheless she must press forward to save her father and herself. D is a puzzle game requiring Laura to solve esoteric inventory puzzles on a very strict time limit. Each of the game&apos;s four discs must be completed in about thirty minutes each, and saving is not an option. The time is kept track of using Laura&apos;s pocket watch. The pocket watch can also be used to supply hints for puzzles, but after three uses the glass will shatter and it will stop working. The game also has multiple endings.</story>

Points are awarded for accuracy with extras for making certain &apos;combos&apos; (mini-routines within a song which are deemed especially difficult or long). The PS2 version of the game has 30 tracks (around 20 of which are famous/original) by artists including Misteeq, Run D.M.C, Liberty X, Sugababes, Room 5, Sophie Ellis Bextor, Chic, The Trammps, 5ive, Junior Senior, Las Ketchup and DJ Sammy. There are initially three difficulty levels, and the player can either practise one song at a time (in Jukebox mode) or enter the Dance-UK Championship, winning which will unlock a &apos;Dance Recorder&apos; mode in which players can record their own dance routines. In multiplayer up to 8 players can compete in succession or 2 players can compete head-to-head. A karaoke mode is also provided for use with a wireless microphone (sold separately) whilst &apos;Aerobic&apos; Mode calculates the number of calories you&apos;ve burnt during play.</story>

    <story>Dance-UK- eXtra Trax follows in the wake of Dance-UK and it&apos;s gameplay is virtually identical in every respect. It too takes the standard &apos;bemani&apos; formula - arrows appear rhythmically on screen and the player must hit the corresponding button (on either a dance mat peripheral or the standard controller) in time with these arrows and the music. Points are awarded for accuracy with extras for making certain &apos;combos&apos; (mini-routines within a song which are deemed especially difficult or long). The original game PS1 version of the game had twenty tracks, this game has just twelve. It can be played in either Aerobic mode, which calculates but does not record the number of calories you&apos;ve burnt during play, or Dance mode. Dance mode can be played in head-to-head, multiplayer or jukebox modes and has four three difficulty levels, beginner, easy, medium and expert. Head to head requires two controllers while the other two require just the one. In all modes the player can either select the track they wish to dance to or let the game select a random track, jukebox mode also has a dance recorder function, which does not have to be unlocked as it did in Dance-UK, but when the player dances to the playback the score is not recorded in the high score table. Though the game is intended to be used with a dance mat it can be played using a standard controller. There is an optional karaoke feature which shows the words of the song while the player is dancing, the words do not show during the dance recording or playback features. </story>

    <story>Endorsed by the then England and Manchester United captain and international superstar, David Beckham Soccer is the last of Rage long tradition in developing soccer games. It includes both national and club teams (from England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain), plus the ability to create custom teams, with details ranging from the usual name, strips and colours to the stadium. Other than Beckham himself, no player is licensed (likeness is preserved, but names are replaced with phonetic equivalents, such as “Owin” or “Zanetee”), but the editor also allows the player to customize each player and team. Game modes include friendly, club season, several international cups (including the defunct Home Championship), Classic Matches (some featuring the highlights of Beckham&apos;s career, others just classic matches), Beat Brazil, where the player starts with France, and tries to beat Brazil with a progressively weaker team, Survival, where the player face top international teams, with goals against carrying over, until the player loses a match, and Train With Beckham, a series of drill minigames destined to teach the basics of the game and unlock “secrets”. Gameplay is similar to previous titles developed by the company (most notably Microsoft Football 2000 and UEFA Striker), and not unlike Beckham, has its strong point during dead ball situations, where the player can choose either to use a set play to get the defense offguard, or take a direct shot or swerving pass using the traditional arrow indicator. In terms of options, the game doesn’t offer much to tweak, only bookings, offsides, injuries, match length and the decider (simple or golden goal overtime and penalty shootout)</story>

Players are armed with a variety of weapons (chainsaws, grenades, machine guns, etc...) and a full range of unarmed combat moves (including the good old-fashioned crotch kick) all of which can be used to defend the goal but remember, the best defense is a good offense. DBZ also has many of the features you would expect from a typical sports game including player development, league and season management, and stat tracking (scores, kills, etc...).</story>

The game doesn&apos;t mess too much with a background story- it&apos;s a 3D one on one fighter that takes place within an arena of limited space. Each character has their own unique way of fighting, their own abilities, and even their own hobbies and likes.

    <story>This is the third game in Temco&apos;s Deception Series, launched on 1999 for PSX. The plot does not have any satanic/evil references (like the first Deception) or playing from the brainwashed manipulated character that kill a lot of innocent people (like the second Kagero- Deception II). In Dark Delusion, you play as Reina, a girl who was kidnapped with her family and taken away via ship to a far off kingdom and may be used for some unpleasant purposes. After escape, she must try to survive while helping the people that helped her. Her persecutors have interest in a mysterious gem brooch she owns, which gives her the power of controlling traps (pendulums, bombs, claws, arrows, and other sadistic + lethal traps). But, what a price? You control the character in a 3D environment in which you place traps to kill your persecutors (who have weapons). It&apos;s a real-time game that allows you to use a system of (timing + skill of activating traps) through the rooms of a medieval castle as the opponents try to kill you. As you activate the traps, you can link them to activate each other, in way to increase the number of combos. Depending on how you kill your opponents, and how many of them, determines how much Ark (money) you get to develop better traps. They can be created by using ancient black magic- emblems (fire, ice, thunder, poison, etc.), orbs (that improve the power of the trap) and rings (automatic, charge, damage, zero, etc.). There are many other traps set over the environment, working automatically out of control of the player (spears, spikes, fans, etc.). They also can be used to increase the (combos + damage) inflicted at your victims. Oh, I mean, invaders... The game features over 2000 different traps, improved 3D, four modes of play (story, mission, training, license), improved trap element system (linking traps), and multiple endings that change according the choices you take through the story mode. Deception may be considered a test of (creativity + cruelty) for the player.</story>

    <story>In the far future, conflict is at an all-time low and outdated defence bases are being vacated and replaced with automated software. You play as an engineer sent to update one such base. Just after uploading the automating code, the base is suddenly invaded by unknown assailants from the air and ground. You must rely on your wits and the defence software to fend them off. The main game takes place in a first-person view inside the complex. Trams connect the maze-like living areas to a handful of manned turrets outside. You must shuttle between shooting down waves of fighters in the turrets, and scouring the base levels for card keys during the down time. A third consideration is the Virtual Operating System controlling all major base functions. You use this interface to repair damage from attacks, monitor intruders, and place robot sentries to guard key passages. As you find more access keys, you can increase the software&apos;s efficiency to the point that you can command turrets remotely, or set them to auto-attack with a high degree of success. As defending the base becomes more automated and efficient, you have more time to search the levels for keys. Your ultimate goal is to find the clearance to self-destruct the base, defend your escape shuttle, and get out alive.</story>

    <story>Demolition Racer is a racing game with a twist. Rather than a game that just requires you to try and win the race, this game gives you points to destroy the other racers&apos; cars. The game has many styles of game play so you don&apos;t have to play the same style each game. There are 5 game styles in the Single Race section of the game. This section does not count towards unlocking cars or tracks. It is for practice and just plain fun. The main style is Demolition. In Demolition, you race against other cars around the track and get points for hitting them, spinning them in circles and knocking them into the wall. You also get a big bonus for landing on top of a car which will immediately destroy the car. When you finish the race, your final position is found by multiplying the points you got from hitting the other cars with the points that you got for the position you finished in. So if you finish first, but never hit anyone, you won&apos;t win the race. The next style is The Chase. This style is your normal race game. You can still take damage and so can the other cars, but you are only trying to win the race. You don&apos;t get any points for hitting the other cars. Chicken is another style. It is the same as The Chase except that you drive in the opposite direction as everyone else. This can slow you down when you run into the cars coming around from the other direction. The next 2 game styles aren&apos;t done on race tracks. They are done in an arena. This is a circle area which may have hills in it where you just try to destroy cars. The first of these is Last Man Standing. In this style, you try to destroy every car without being destroyed yourself. You can still win if you aren&apos;t the last car by making a lot of points by hitting other cars. The scoring is calculated the same as the Demolition style. The final Single Race style is Suicide. In this style, you try to destroy yourself before any others are destroyed. You don&apos;t get any points for hitting other cars in this style. Besides the Single Race, there is also League Racing. In League racing, you are trying to beat a set of tracks. There are 4 leagues on tracks and one league in the arena. In order to beat a track (or arena), you must place in a certain position. The first league starts out easy; you can finish in 5th place and still beat the track and go on to the next one. However, as you go up in difficulty of leagues, you will eventually have to place 1st on every track in the league to beat it. A league will usually have 5-10 tracks to beat. After you beat a league, you will unlock cars, tracks and other leagues. There are 11 tracks, 3 arenas and 8 cars that you can get. The cars can be customized with colors and logos. You can also have portraits of the racers on top of the cars.</story>

    <story>The Post-Terran Minerals Corporation (PTMC) digs up minerals on all nine planets of the solar system, employing humans and robots to do its job. Unfortunately, the mining robots are now being controlled by a hacker, and have taken the human workers hostage. The PTMC has tried to get the robots back under their control, but communication with the mining stations has been lost. In desperation, the PTMC modifies a Pyro-GX ship for combat and hires a mercenary, codenamed Material Defender, to fly it. The mission is to destroy the infected mines and rescue human hostages, destroying any hostile robot that gets in the way. Descent is a 3D first-person game that puts the player at the controls of the Pyro-GX spaceship. Descent is notable in that the player travels through various interior locations (mines) but can do so in 720 degrees of movement. The ship however only moves forward and backward in any of the directions it is facing. The ship is able to use a variety of weapons scattered as power-ups throughout each level. They include- standard lasers, the Vulcan Cannon (a chaingun-like weapon), the Spreadfire Cannon (a rapidly firing, shotgun-like energy weapon), the Plasma Cannon (a rapidly firing energy weapon more suited for medium-range combat), and the Fusion Cannon (fires a ball of energy that&apos;s more powerful the longer it is charged it up, but could destroy the ship). All of these weapons, except for the Vulcan Cannon, use the ship&apos;s energy supply. The Pyro-PX is also capable of firing regular concussion missiles, homing missiles, proximity bombs (sits in the sky, then explodes when something gets close to it), smart missiles (more powerful homing missiles that fire out homing energy balls upon impact with their target), and Mega Missiles (the ultimate weapons of mass destruction). The goal of each level is to locate and destroy the mine&apos;s reactor. Once completed, there are only 45 seconds to find the escape hatch to get out of the mine before it explodes. As progress is made through the game, the AI will adapt to player&apos;s strategies and attempt to prevent the player from reaching the goals.</story>

The player has total 360-degree movement of the ship to navigate through the twisting mines and is equipped with over 20 specialized weapons. Descent Maximum was the second and final Descent game available for the Playstation game console. Initially, the game was to be a direct port of Descent II to the Playstation, however at the time Sony were rejecting PC ports of games to the PS in the US, so the game was retooled, renamed and all the previous levels were scrapped in favor of 36 (!) new Playstation exclusive levels. It was still released as Descent 2 for the Playstation in foreign markets.</story>

A new 3D collision detection system allows for bigger chrashes and larger pile-ups, while with new Destruction Combo moves, you can trash the enemy in many more ways. Game modes include Wreckin&apos; Racing, Smash 4 $, and Battle. Wreckin&apos; Racing has you racing for survival through the usual set of racing tracks, each with obstacles and hidden shortcuts. Every race you win opens up a new track. Smash 4 $ has you using every trick in the book to take out the other cars on the track. The more you take out, and the way you do so, determines how much money you win. That money can be used to spend on new cars. Finally, Battle is a free-for-all destruction arena battle, where up to four players as well as heaps of CPU controlled cars smash it out to see who is the last man standing in the crush.</story>

    <story>Destructo 2 is a simple color-matching puzzle game similar to Mr. Driller, originally released as part of a budget series in Japan. The main objective is to guide a cartoon character moving through an ascending pile of multicolored tiles, pushing the available blocks to create clusters of the same color. Groups of four or more tiles of matching colors can be removed by punching one of the connected blocks, with the vacant space being occupied by the falling stacks on top. The descending tiles that end up rearranged in new color clusters are automatically eliminated and give combo points. As the tiles accumulate on the screen, the water level at the bottom starts to proportionally rise, receding when enough blocks are destroyed. The health meter for the main character is displayed below the gamefield, decreasing when suffering injuries from bomb explosions or drowning. The character also dies after being crushed against the top by the blocks. Power-ups and other items can be found inside containers that randomly appear on the pile, that have to be broke open with three punches to reveal their contents. The blue items give bonus points, eliminate all the tiles of a particular color, lower the water level and help in other ways, while the red items do the opposite and have to be avoided.</story>

    <story>Long ago a secret war raged between Heaven and Hell, each using humanity as its pawns. While the Prime Evils of Hell were engaged in war their lesser lieutenants conspired to overthrow them. They mutinied suddenly with the combined forces of Hell, overwhelming the three Primes. Stripped of their power, they were banished to the mortal realm. Human agents of Heaven, upon discovering this, found the three Primes and sealed them within gemstone prisons, each of them sent to a different corner of the earth and kept under guard to prevent them from escaping. As years turns to centuries, however, the power of Heaven&apos;s agents waned, until eventually not even the people of the town of Tristram knew that buried deep under their chapel was the soul of the Lord of Terror, Diablo. As the strength of his prison waned Diablo reached out into the world, corrupting the dreams of the land&apos;s good king, driving him to attack his neighbors. The nation of Khanduras fought wars with no intention of winning, desiring only slaughter and suffering. Now the lands lay scorched, home only to monsters and the dead. Rumors spread of a way to stop the demons, as well as rumors of great wealth, and both draw adventurers from far to the small town of Tristram. Players start by choosing their avatar&apos;s class- either Warrior, Rogue, or Sorcerer. Warriors have the highest maximum strength and can repair weapons and armor inside the dungeon, but this will lower the item&apos;s maximum durability. The Rogue has the highest maximum dexterity and can both see and disarm traps on treasure chests. The Sorcerer has the highest maximum magic attribute and can recharge the charges on a spellcasting staff at the cost of his own mana. Characters can equip armor, weapons, and accessories found in the chapel&apos;s shifting dungeons, but strong equipment will have minimum attribute requirements to be worn. Most equipment will have randomized stats, but some strong monsters will drop Unique weapons with set stats. Magic can be learned by finding magic tomes, and leveled up by finding multiples of the same spell tome, but advanced spell levels can not be learned if the character&apos;s magic stat is too low. Upon destroying enough monsters to level up the player is rewarded with additional attribute points to distribute to whichever attributes they wish. Occasionally the few people left in town will inform the player of a job they would like done, either an exceptionally strong monster that must be slain or a unique item found deep in the dungeon, and will reward the player in kind upon completion of the quest. Diablo can be played cooperatively with 1 to 3 other players over LAN or BattleNet with the PC versions, or with 1 player locally on the PlayStation. Players can team up to survive the depths of the dungeons, or turn on each other to steal one another&apos;s items from their corpse. The quest unique zones are removed from the online version of a dungeon, and instead quest monsters will be found wandering the level that would normally lead to their unique area.</story>

    <story>As in the first game, Die Hard Trilogy 2 is broken up into three types of gameplay- shootin&apos;, drivin&apos;, and runnin&apos; around. The game can be played either in Movie mode, which manages to tell what little story there is while alternating between gameplay types, or Arcade mode, which lets you pound through all of the shooting or driving levels at once (complete with extra bonus levels).</story>

Soon soon there is a digital terrorist attack, trapping all players inside Digimon Online. The owners of Digimon Online, the MAGAMI Corporation, claim there is no major problem and it will be fixed soon. However, not all is as it seems as Junior, the main character, uncovers secret mysteries about the digimon, the game, and the corporation. Digimon World 3 implements a free roam approach, and is not simply restricted to dungeons and mazes. Like other RPGs, Digimon World 3 has a turn-based battle system, and enemy digimon are fought by random encounters. During battle, it is one-on-one fighting, and thus you can only initially fight with just one digimon at a time. Digimon have many different attacks, skills, and digivolutions (the ability to evolve into a stronger digimon). The player gets to choose a pack of three digimon at the start, but through side-quests, is able to obtain all nine (plus one bonus digimon).</story>

    <story>Three years ago a brilliant scientist disappeared while researching a new form of energy. The government that funded his research wrote the whole affair off as a loss, which made it all the more upsetting when reports of Dr. Kirk&apos;s good health and nearly finished research came in. A special forces team is sent to the doctor&apos;s private island laboratory to extract him and his research, but they are totally unprepared for some of the side effects of his developments. Side effects that come from 100 million years in the past. Dino Crisis is a survival horror game that is very similar in both control and gameplay to its sister series, Resident Evil. As in that series, protagonist Regina will have limited supplies and ammo with which to fight deadly enemies while searching rooms for keys (some figurative, some literal) to open locked areas. Unlike Resident Evil games, Regina will find very few actual supplies laying around, and will instead find plugs that are used to open caches of emergency supplies located around the complex. There are only enough plugs to open some of these caches, however, so care must be taken to decide what items are really needed. In another change from Resident Evil, the game is rendered in 3D, allowing the camera to rotate or pan, although camera angles are still out of the control of the player. Even the dumbest dinosaur is smarter than the undead, and enemies can chase and disarm Regina, and even occasionally follow her through doors.</story>

    <story>The research on the mysterious Third Energy is being continued in secret, but then an entire island with the facility conducting this research and a neighbouring town has vanished, moving back in time to the dinosaur era. A military unit is sent to the past to save the survivors and retrieve the research data. But nearly all soldiers are massacred by dinosaurs. You take control of Regina and Dylan, who managed to escape this fate. Now you must find the survivors, retrieve the data, and get back to your own time. Dino Crisis 2 is a third-person action-adventure game, where you control the characters Dylan and Regina (switching from one to another at various points in the storyline). You will collect items and use them to solve puzzles while fighting the hordes of dinosaurs that inhabit the island. Much like Alone in the Dark, the game uses 3d models for characters, enemies and items and static 2D backgrounds for their surroundings. Initially, each character starts with a gun and a melee weapon, but more weapons, such as flamethrowers or rocket launchers, can be bought later in the game. The dinosaurs&apos; attacks cause you to lose vitality, which can be restored using healing items. Sometimes an attack will cause you to bleed and thus slowly lose health; specific health items stop the bleeding. For each killed dinosaur you receive Extinction Points. By killing a couple of dinos in quick succession, you activate a &apos;combo&apos; and thus get more points. The points can be used in Save Shops throughout the game to buy weapons, ammo (and cartridge upgrades which allow you to store more ammo within the weapon), healing items and tools (such as armor, more powerful melee weapons, or cards which allow you to get bigger combos). You can also save the game at these points. While wandering around the island, you&apos;ll find many documents and letters to read, including Dino Files, which contain a flavor description of a dino species.</story>

    <story>This is Ankh-Morpork, a city surrounded by darkness, where the cold river Ankh flows, where it is always raining, and where dwarves and trolls co-exist with mysterious societies, religious fanatics, stupid police captains, and bar pianists. It is also where a bitterly sarcastic sharp-eyed PI Lewton tries to earn a living solving bizarre cases. A mysterious woman named Carlotta hires him to find her lost lover. Wandering through the dark city and gathering evidence, Lewton has to solve the case, confront a sinister conspiracy, and once again become torn between love and despair. Discworld Noir differs from other Discworld games not only because of its much more serious tone and dark Film Noir-style atmosphere, but also because of its gameplay. Instead of inventory-based puzzles there are clues, which Lewton writes down in his notebook and which should be then used whenever there is a connection between the clue and the situation in question.</story>

The game boasts realistic machinery controls and authentic looks. Winnie the Pooh plans a party and therefore he needs honey. His friend Tigger promises to help him and starts searching for honey pots. Tigger&apos;s Honey Hunt is a platform action game in which the player guides Tigger through nine levels. In six levels the goal is to collect a predetermined minimum amount of honey pots in order to get access to the next level. In the other three levels there are mini-games like Rock-Paper-Scissors, to play against other characters from Winnie the Pooh&apos;s world. Tigger is able to jump horizontally and vertically (even higher after he has learned special skills), use spider webs to jump to higher areas or to cross water or chasms with the help of turtles or levitating leaves. Beginning with three lives, Tigger needs to avoid being touched by dangerous creatures like bees or falling into chasms. When there are no lives left, Tigger restarts at the last checkpoint that has been passed. Additionally you can find secret areas with even more honey pots, collect pictures which you can later look at in your photo album and meet other characters who talk to you or need your help (e.g. finding Eeyore&apos;s lost tail).</story>

Roam through the streets and rooftops of London as well as the ponds and fields of the surrounding countryside in your quest to find them. When your brothers and sisters are dognapped by Cruella De Vil, you team up with Patch&apos;s favorite TV star Thunderbolt in an effort to rescue them. Gameplay is fairly basic for a 3-D platformer. In each of the 29 levels you collect a set number of items (bones, snacks, apples, etc.), avoid enemies (cats, squirrels, bobbies, etc. + Horace, Jasper, &amp; Cruella herself), and rescue your siblings. Patch is able to dig, roll, bark, and jump as he runs through London and the surrounding area. There are some timed bonus rounds (i.e. collect all 60 bones in 45 seconds) every 4 or 5 levels that help give the game more variety. After each bonus level is a cut scene that consists of a handful of still frames from the movie with accompanying text. Due to these scenes&apos; infrequency, the story can be difficult to understand if the game is not supplemented by watching the movie.</story>

    <story>Disney&apos;s Dinosaur is a role-playing game based on the movie of the same name. Three characters are controlled- Flia the pteradon, Aladar the Iguanadon and Zini the lemur, each of whom has different abilities. Flia can fly, Aladar can wade through water and crush rocks and Zini can fit through small spaces and pick things up. The game is seen from a top-down perspective, with the player switching characters on the fly. As in the movie, they must work together to reach the sacred nesting grounds for water and food after the rest of world dries up. Throughout the game, the characters&apos; abilities are upgraded via an Intelligent Points System in an RPG-like addition. The game includes FMV clips from the movie and a dinosaur encyclopedia with information about real dinosaurs. This PlayStation version of the game features different levels and more colourful and less realistic graphics than the PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast versions.</story>

    <story>Aliens have landed in futuristic Los Angeles and it&apos;s up to the Duke to bring the pain and show them the door. After the initial entries of side-scrolling platform games, Duke Nukem 3D introduces a first-person perspective to the series and turns the game into a full-fledged shooter with 2.5D graphics. Duke&apos;s arsenal includes pistols, pipe bombs, laser trip mines, Nordenfelt guns, a chain gun and various rocket launchers, but also his mighty foot to kick enemies. The game sports a high level of interactivity. Many objects in the environment can be broken or interacted with, such as pool tables, arcade machines, glass, light switches and security cameras. The protagonist is also able to hand strippers dollars to have them remove their top. The main character regularly delivers commentary on the events through one-liners. There are twenty-eight levels, divided over three episodes, set in locations such as streets, a church, a space station, a Japanese villa, a football field and many modern environments. Enemies mainly include aliens, mutated humans and members of the police force that have been turned into Pig Cops. Next to weapons, Duke also has access to medikits, steroids to enhance his speed, night vision, protective boots, a hologram known as the holoduke, and a jetpack to reach higher areas. Most of the gameplay is action-oriented, but there is also an amount of puzzles needed to progress or access secret areas. The game includes network play through the IPX protocol, for deathmatch and cooperative games.</story>

    <story>Dune 2000 is a remake of the classic Dune II updated for Windows. In this Real-Time Strategy game, you can play one of the three houses, the evil Harkonnen, the greed filled Ordos or the noble Atreides. Each has different sets of units and tactics while maintaining an overall balance. Unlike the original, the cutscenes happen after every mission, with live-cast this time, already seen in Westwood Studio&apos;s Command &amp; Conquer franchise. A 16-bit color mode was the next step for their RTS genre, boosting up the graphics in Dune 2000. Everything from the original is back - sandworms, the spice, the Fremen, the known structures and the map of the planet, even the intro cinematic is a 3D enhanced version of the original one. Each house fights differently. The noble Atreides have air-superiority and rely on their honour and alliance with planet natives, the Fremen. The insidious Ordos rely on guerrilla tactics and superior technology, as well as mercenaries. The evil Harkonnen just go brutal, with no care for lives of their own troops or destruction as longs as they are victorious. Unlike the Windows version, the PlayStation version of the game is fully 3D.</story>

    <story>An oddity for Koei (at least at the time this was released) - an action-packed 3D fighting game. At least it&apos;s still steeped in traditional Chinese history/mythology- in fact, it&apos;s based on the background used in Koei&apos;s Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. Over 2000 years ago, Guang-Wu revived the Han Dynasty in China. Wars and chaos follow for centuries after, because of regional conflicts, rival dynasties, and bureaucratic problems. An insurgent group, the Yellow Turban Rebels, roams China killing government officials... ...the current Emperor Shao is protected by troops raised by the nobles of the land - but each noble has their own plan to gain power. The characters can be chosen from four groups, each representing one of the main kingdoms - Shu, Wei, and Wu, as well as a miscellaneous-character 4th group. The fighting is based on actual martial arts and weapons (and the tactics thereof) rather than focusing on combos, special moves, or other modern fighting-game embellishments.</story>

    <story>Compared to its predecessor released a year earlier, Supercross features a more action-oriented style of gameplay. Tricks are smoother and may come a little more easily, but players will still have to hold the right line and perfect their timing if they&apos;re going to be real contenders in the Motocross circuit. Players will race through several indoor and outdoor tracks in this dirt bike simulation from EA SPORTS, and a freestyle mode is available as well, offering a perfect track for maximum air and wild tricks. The most notable change in Supercross is that EA opted to go with a more arcade-styled control scheme this time around. While this may come as a disappointment to gamers looking for the ultimate motocross sim, fact of the matter is, they tried the more realistic approach in the last game and it did not work well. Besides, with this game&apos;s new hold-the-accelerator-and-don&apos;t-let-go approach, gamers will get a better sense of the speed they would experience in they actually participated in a motocross event. </story>

    <story>You throttle your engine, the bikes beside you are roaring and ready to let fly. The starting light turns green and you hit the gas, sending your bike flying over the initial jump at Bank One Ballpark. The rest of the field tries to find their bearings after being blown away by your aggressive start. You fly around corners, shredding up the dirt which paves the course. Your arch-rival closes in, but you cut him off on the sharp hairpin turn and he&apos;s left spinning out on the side. You throttle up and do a little show-boating for the crowd as the checkered flag is waved in your honor! If you thought that little teaser sounded good, then brace yourself for Supercross 2000 for the PlayStation. Featuring all of the trimmings, this hard-hitting simulation of the world which is Supercross will hold no punches. You&apos;ll be able to race through season modes with one or two players involved in the competition. Although, you can just have a friendly race and play with yourself if you wish. Deciding who you want to be is also a challenge, as 24 top Supercross and freestlye stars have been included for your racing pleasure. What are those freestyle racers for? How about a freestyle jump-off where you pull of tricks and maneuvers to impress the fickle fans and hard-nosed judges! You like your racing to look real eh? How about real physics for all of the motorbikes so racers will actually jump and land with the proper acceleration and angle. In the jump off, the players will sail over jumps and execute their tricks with the same confidence of their real-life counterparts. The views of the action are even authentic, with exclusive fly-bys and a stuntcam/PIP view. Also, announcers Art Eckman and David Bailey will be calling the action just like they do on ESPN! You&apos;ll also experience the full feeling of control as racers will actually jump, throttle and turn much like they do in actual races. Stunts such as Nac-Nacs, Supermans and No-Handers can also be pulled off with the push of a single button. All of this is teamed with the Dual Shock Controller, which adds vibration and analog support to the game. If your ready for some authentic EA SPORTS Supercross action then grab your controller and get to the starting line! </story>

    <story>A number of games allow you to search the tombs of ancient Egypt, but few allow you to do so IN ancient Egypt. Taking place (appropriately enough) in 1156 B.C., you play Ramose, a young Egyptian man who hopes to prove himself a worthy investigator for the current rulers of Egypt. Your first assignment is not an easy one, as a Tomb of Sethi I, a pharaoh has been desecrated and looted and your own father has been accused of the crime. You have three days to prove his innocence and stay the sentence of execution. Gameplay takes place in a first person mode similar to fans of this kind of adventure game. Unlike some games that give you a static, unmoving image to look at, Egypt 1156 B.C. allows you to look around at any location in a smooth turn (similar to QuickTime VR, but with better results). This gives you a &apos;you are there&apos; feel that many other games lack. All graphics are 3-D rendered and occassionally actions will give you a third person cutscene as a reward. Communication is through a simple branch tree and both talking and puzzle solving involves the manipulation of objects, both in and out of your inventory. In addition to being a mystery/adventure game, Egypt 1156 B.C. also comes with reference material about ancient Egypt, its people, and its culture. These are available whenever you discover something interesting in the middle of the game or can be accessed via the main menu. </story>

The game takes place in the city of Heliopolis, the City of the Sun, which was the center of learning and one of the most important capitals of Egypt in 1350 B.C. Your character is Tifet, a young priestess and a student of medicine, who sets out to find the cure for the horrific epidemic which is spreading rapidly throughout the city population.

    <story>Ehrgeiz- God Bless the Ring is an arcade-style fighting game from the makers of the Final Fantasy series. In the port for the Playstation - Cloud, Tifa, Yuffie, Vincent, Zack, Red XIII &amp; Sephiroth from FF7 join the many characters from the arcade game released in Japan. This is a free roaming beat-em-up that can only be likened to the more recent Power Stone on the Dreamcast. Comprised of the main arcade mode, mini-game mode, and an all new RPG mode known as Brand New Quest. The mini-game mode contains four games- - Battle Beach, a triathlon of button mashing. - Battle Square, tackle-Othello on a disco floor - Infinity Battle, an endurance test with unlimited lives. - And a foot racing game using the fighting game controls. The main game mode is an arcade-style fighting game. Charismatic fighters from around the world compete in a tournament for a mysterious sword as the prize. In addition to your archetypes of kick boxers, wrestlers, and mixed martial artists there are also animal type fighters, homing missiles, characters with swords, and many other attacks that shake things up. The fighting system is based on attack height (much like Bushido Blade) - with the triangle, square, and x buttons corresponding to high, mid, and low attacks respectively. There are also different buttons for low and high guard - both working against mid-level attacks but specific to high and low attacks. The circle button is used for &apos;special&apos; attacks, which drain the &apos;special&apos; bar. There is a button to jump, as well as a button that changes between &apos;locking&apos; on the target to move or free running. The standard balance in fighting games is speed vs. damage. Whether it be ranged or melee attacks, the &apos;damage per second&apos; should be the same - as every character has an equal health bar. Ehrgeiz is a very balanced game, despite the complexity presented by how fundamentally different most characters are. The vast differences between certain characters require the player to devise separate strategies for different opponents. The animal type opponents, for example, can only be hit with roughly half the attacks of the normal opponents - head kicks, many long range attacks, and most throws will hit empty air, especially since animal characters can &apos;duck&apos; even lower to the ground. Fighting a gun wielding character will result in a battle where you must chase and pin down. Fighting Cloud or Sephiroth will require both constant pressure and vigilance against being thrown to ensure that they are not able to unsheathe their sword and finish the fight in a few blows. The game features unlock-able costumes and characters, as well as &apos;ending videos&apos;. The Brand New Quest feature is a dungeon delver that uses the fighting game engine along with randomly generated dungeon layouts to create a 25 level dungeon with set bosses. It borrows the magic and equipment system from the Final Fantasy games, you will collect materia and magic stones, as well as a full range of visibly different weapons and armour. This game puts strong emphasis on food (like the early Ultima series). Not only will you have to eat, but you will have to be conscious of what you are eating - your diet affects how your stats change at level up. Eat meat for strength, minerals for dexterity, carbs for speed, lipids for defence, and vitamins for magical ability. Standing still allows your depleting &apos;stomach&apos; meter to fill your health. If your hunger meter reaches &apos;zero&apos;, however, it will start draining your health. There are two playable characters, and the game can be played with both characters or with only one.</story>

    <story>In 2192, a new city, Selene, is built on the moon. Over the years, Selene grows larger, more powerful, and more independent of the Earth - to the point that the moon and Earth battle in a war that winds down without a definite victory for either side. In 2242, war breaks out again - the Earth slowly begins to win... except for the efforts of an experimental Selene technology known as Einhänders- flying machines with a hand that allows them to change weaponry mid-battle. On December 12, 2245, Selene sends down 3 Einhänders in a last attempt to turn the tide of the war. You get to choose the craft to pilot, and it&apos;s up to you to battle your way through the Earth&apos;s monstrous defenses and win the battle. The game is a traditional side-scrolling shooter, with rendered 3D backgrounds and enemies. The atmosphere of the game is very industrial, down to the German industrial music playing in the background (think Einsturzende Neubauten mixed with Lords of Acid). The weapon-switching and claiming is an integral part of the game, as weapons have limited shots. This forces a bit more strategy than the usual button-mashing shooters inspire.</story>

The player can also determine which character they want to race with, each one having a unique skill on one of the apparatus. For example one might be top-notch at roller blading but be bad at bike-riding so there is no point choosing the bike with him/her. In a season, the player competes in the five locations - three times, twelve in all and each time the obstacles become more and more tricky to avoid as well as the other racers becoming faster and more agile. The tracks are- Italy - Country roads leading down to a town area; Lake Tahoe - Twisting roads and strategically placed haystacks; South America - Lots of caves and thin jungle roads; San Francisco - Hundreds of obstacles and hills; Utah - Falling rocks, secret routes, and some hungry looking crocodiles.</story>

    <story>Luke and his sister Elena are two orphans, living in a small house in the kingdom of Gross. They have two good friends - Mouse and Nicol. One day, while exploring a local cave, the four youths find a mysterious jewel. Later, they travel to the city of Goondocks, where they find a similar jewel - along with a note left to them by Luke&apos;s and Elena&apos;s parents. They learn that their parents belonged to an ancient race named Eternal Eyes - people who could control inanimate dolls called Mappets. Now the four heroes have to learn the power of controlling Mappets, and to stop a villain from resurrecting the Goddess of Destruction. Eternal Eyes is a combination of strategy console-style RPG similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, and Pokémon-like monster-breeding gameplay. The only controllable human character in your party is Luke. Throughout the game, he will be able to capture more and more Mappets, which will then help him during his quest, also participating in battles. There are different kinds of Mappets which can be used with various effects during the turn-based battles.</story>

Quick Races offers all cars and tracks with different game types, while championship is divided into three sections, for each of the vehicle types- Standard, Sports Car and ATV. Adventure consists of 20 tracks after each other. The European cities included are London, Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, Barcelona, Athens, Hamburg, Stockholm, Rome, Florence, Paris, Amsterdam, Marseille and Moscow. Each city has distinctive landmarks. While racing, players can choose to represent a club, based on nationality and with a different car skin. There are more than 30 cars with different speed and handling, from regular cars to sports models and off-road ATVs. During championships vehicles can be upgraded. Players can pick up items while racing, such as boost, repair (cars can be damaged and have a visible damage model), invincibility and cash. The streets are filled with traffic, pedestrians and obstacles. There are different camera perspectives to choose from and there is support for downloadable tracks and cars.</story>

    <story>Long ago, scientists created a living space station, full of animals. After its launch into space, the station vanished, never to be seen again. Until now. The station has reappeared out of no-where, many years after its first launch, and is on a collision course with Earth. Two unlikely heroes (pilot and all-round ugly looking guy Dan and robot Evo) are now thrust with the mission to stop the station, and find out where it has been all this time. Sadly, not everything goes to plan, with their ship crashing into the station. Evo, the unlucky robot that he is, is thrown out of the ship and smashed into pieces. His only hope for survival is to attach his microchip into another host robot. Thankfully, underneath the wrecked ship is the remains of another robot, and with a quick fix Evo is now a robotic dog. As you enter the valley, you must contend with a host of other robots much like the dog, of all shapes and animal sizes. You can move Evo&apos;s chip from one animal to another to gain attributes and abilities, improving your chance of success to get past the killer penguins and rocket launching tigers. Aims of the game include the basic destruction of enemy robots, to sheep herding, controlling Evo the rat through a mini maze, and plenty more through 35 levels of insane 3rd person action. When the game was ported to PlayStation some of the bugs from the Nintendo 64 version were fixed.</story>

For one, you are now able to drive motorcycles in addition to cars, and you also have headlights you can turn on if visibility of the track starts to dim. Like Burning Road, this game is an arcade racer. Drifting is similar to Sega Rally, as taking a turn will cause your car to slide. You not only have to race against your opponents, but also against time. Passing through the checkpoints throughout the track will replenish your time limit, but you have to be quick and careful not to crash into anything! In the beginning, you start off with only two tracks, six vehicles, and the Practice and Championship modes. By successfully clearing the game modes in specific ways, you can unlock more tracks, vehicles and additional game modes. There&apos;s also a two player mode which can be accessed using the PlayStation Link Cable.</story>

    <story>This is the sequel to Flashback- the Quest for Identity. You take control of Conrad, the hero from Flashback, who has been imprisoned by his old enemy, the Morphs. Gaining the trust and assistance of the mysterious Ancients, Conrad must fight off the Morph invasion, not knowing who he can trust... Fade to Black uses fully polygonal graphics for both character models and environment. The camera changes angles depending on the location of the player character, like in Alone in the Dark games. Conrad can use various weapons to eliminate the enemies, and will also have to solve some puzzles on the way. He can not, however, perform as many moves as in Flashback; he can&apos;t climb or jump, and the only way he can potentially avoid being shot by enemies is by ducking.</story>

    <story>It starts as a simple assignment for the three mercenaries - the beautiful, mysterious Hana, the former army officer Glas, and the ruthless killer Deke. Somewhere in the futuristic Hong-Kong, full of huge corporations, flying cars and helicopters, home for the famous Triad mafia, they have to find the young Wee Ming Lam, the daughter of a powerful gangster. But Hana and her partners don&apos;t suspect that the search for Wee Ming will lead them not only to very dangerous areas of Hong-Kong, but to outskirt villages infected by zombies, a dubious restaurant-brothel, and the Chinese hell, where they&apos;ll have to confront Yim Lau Wong himself - the Chinese equivalent of the Western Satan... The gameplay of Fear Effect is based on survival horror titles à la Resident Evil, but it also features many pure action elements and arcade-like sequences, where precise timing matters. You can crouch, sneak on your enemies, and roll forward or to the sides. There are many human as well as monster enemies to eliminate or to avoid. The game&apos;s characters are created in animé style, although they appear in full 3D. The backgrounds are pre-rendered, but very intensely animated, similar to those of Blade Runner. The story unfolds through numerous FMV cut scenes.</story>

Chinese folk tales and mythology are woven together with 3rd person action gameplay and horror themes in a science-fiction setting. The gameplay is basically the same as in the first game, but you have more weapons and the ability to choose between classic survival horror and 3D camera-based control types. You can shoot, run, crouch, roll, and sneak on your enemies. There is also a good deal of puzzle-solving in the game.

Chinese folk tales and mythology are woven together with 3rd person action gameplay and horror themes in a science-fiction setting. The gameplay is basically the same as in the first game, but you have more weapons and the ability to choose between classic survival horror and 3D camera-based control types. You can shoot, run, crouch, roll, and sneak on your enemies. There is also a good deal of puzzle-solving in the game. The game is rich on movie sequences in animÃ© style, and animated pre-rendered backgrounds.</story>

New and improved dead ball control makes corner kicks, free kicks, etc. more controllable and gives you more options.

Promote players, demote players and renegotiate contracts, all in an effort to get your team to the finals again and again. The skills to master range from kicked passes and headers to lob passes and bicycle kicks. You can take control of players before the ball reaches them, which makes it easier to find space to take the ball. Like other 2004 titles, FIFA uses the right analog stick for it&apos;s Freestyle gameplay.

    <story>Released only a few months after Euro 2004, FIFA 2005 brings several features to the franchise, such as the return of a player creation tool, where a player can be created from scratch from customizing the face (while it&apos;s not possible to define the texture like in previous EA Sports games such as NHL 2000, the player can customize the facial features such as shape of the eyes or the cheeks, in a way similar to RPGs such as Neverwinter Nights), accessories and playing abilities. It&apos;s also possible to create all kinds of competitions. The Career mode was also extended, allowing now up to 15 seasons, and giving the player the chance to turn the tide of a simulated match anytime. This mode is a light managerial mode, where the player not only plays, but also signs new players and increase the clubs abilities in trainers, medical staff and other club staff). The main gameplay change was the addition of First Touch controls. By performing one of the trick moves before the player gets possession of the ball it&apos;s possible to do a number of moves, such as touching the ball forward to gain a few yards ahead of the defenders or touch the ball to one side, and roll to the other of a rushing defender, and then pickup up the ball a bit ahead leaving the opponent stranded, and the inclusion of a fake shot move, which allows forwards to sit a goalkeeper before scoring in style or make defenders jump from their positions, opening room for a through pass or a run into goal. Other aspects of the game, such as the Off The Ball controls (allows the control of players that aren&apos;t in possession, moving them into an open position) remain unchanged. Another new feature is the FIFA Shop, where the player can trade points earned in many ways, from simple tasks like having a peek at the Jukebox to obtaining 10 victories in a row in Career mode, for several items, such as third jerseys, additional music, more balls and night stadiums. As it became the norm with the series, the game features 18 leagues and 38 national teams (some of these, due to licensing problems feature only generic kits and logos), summing up around 11&apos;000 real footballers.</story>

    <story>Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense of the word, FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept. There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game&apos;s commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases. The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it&apos;s possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup. If you&apos;re not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.</story>

    <story>The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. However, the recent actions of the king make even the most loyal of his subordinates doubt his judgment. The captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to attack the city of Mysidia and take the Water Crystal from innocent magicians who protect it. When Cecil questions the king&apos;s orders, he is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to deliver a package to the village of Mist, accompanied by his best friend Kain, the captain of the dragoons. Little does he realize that the king&apos;s inexplicable behavior is but a part of a much larger picture, which he is yet to reveal. The fourth entry in the Final Fantasy series was released as Final Fantasy II in the West, because the second and the third games were not released there at the time. The game is a Japanese-style RPG with top-down world map navigation, automatic leveling up, and random enemy encounters. The game introduces a system called ATB (active-time battle). While combat is turn-based in its core, the game does not pause when the player accesses the battle menu. Enemies continue to act in real time regardless of the actions of the player-controlled party. The turns of the participants are calculated depending on their agility rating. Each player-controlled character has a special bar that gradually refills itself; said character may act when the bar is full. Unlike all the previous Final Fantasy games, the fourth installment does not allow the player to customize the characters&apos; abilities and classes. Each character belongs to a specific, clearly defined class- dragoon, white mage, black mage, summoner, ninja, etc. Each of these classes has distinct special abilities or magic spells. New abilities are learned automatically when a character reaches a pre-determined level. Characters join and leave the party as dictated by the game&apos;s plot events. The active party includes up to five combatants. The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.</story>

Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that initiates a dangerous series of events. The only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, who offer their very hearts and souls to save the world from the mad plans of the Empire. The sixth entry in the Final Fantasy series was dubbed Final Fantasy III in the West because three out of the five previous installments of the series had not been released there at the time. Similarly to its predecessors, this is a role-playing game where the player controls a party of characters, travelling between various locales in the world, fighting randomly appearing regular enemies and bosses, and making the characters stronger by improving their skills and getting better equipment for them. The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous installments in the series, spicing traditional turn-based combat engine with a real-time element. In battle, every character can fight using weaponry and items, and each has a special combat skill as well. It is also possible for nearly every character to learn magic spells. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, the player can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells the characters should learn. Unlike most other Japanese RPGs, the game does not have a single main character. Rather, the player-controlled party can be considered the game&apos;s collective protagonist. The first part of the game develops linearly, with one of the characters playing a central role; however, during the second part the player is associated with a different character initially, exploring the game world, recruiting characters, and completing sub-quests in a non-linear fashion.</story>

    <story>A young man named Crono is about to enjoy a carefree day- he plans to go to the Millennial Fair, where his friend Lucca intends to demonstrate her newest scientific invention- a teleporter. Upon his arrival Crono meets a young girl named Marle, who volunteers to be the first to test Lucca&apos;s new device. However, Marle&apos;s pendant affects the teleporter&apos;s mechanism in a mysterious way, and as a result she is teleported four hundred years into the past. Crono and Lucca quickly recreate the time portal and follow Marle. They find out that her unexpected appearance has created some confusion, and proceed to fix the error, which in turn leads to unforeseen consequences, eventually compelling the heroes to travel to different time periods and change the history of the world. Chrono Trigger is a Japanese-style role-playing game in which the player takes control of a party consisting of up to seven characters, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment. There are no random encounters in the game- all the enemies are either visibly walking on the field maps and can be avoided by the player, or are waiting to ambush the party. No enemy encounters occur when the player navigates characters over the world map. The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from Final Fantasy games as one of the combat style selections offered to the player in the beginning. The other selectable battle mechanic pauses combat whenever the player accesses the menu, effectively removing the real-time element and rendering the battles fully turn-based. As the characters grow in power, their parameters increase, and they learn new techs - special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them magic points to use in battle. Techs may target a specific formation of enemies (e.g. a line) and can be used tactically depending on the enemies&apos; positioning in combat. Characters may execute techs individually or perform double or triple techs, where each character contributes a tech which is combined with one or two others to unleash a powerful attack. Once player-controlled characters acquire the ability to travel freely between time periods, the game&apos;s plot develops in a non-linear fashion. From that point on the player may opt to face the game&apos;s final adversary in combat and complete the story, or perform other plot-related quests. Depending on the moment of the story when the player decides to proceed to the final battle, the game may be concluded with thirteen different endings. The New Game+ option allows the player to start the game anew after having previously completed it, carrying over levels, techs, and equipment of the characters. The PlayStation version features an anime-style introduction movie and cutscenes, a movie theater mode which allows the player to re-watch these movies and listen to the game&apos;s songs, as well as an unlockable bestiary, dungeon maps, and art gallery. The Nintendo DS version retains these changes and adds two new dungeons and a new possible ending that foreshadows the events of Chrono Cross.</story>

    <story>The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. However, the recent actions of the king make even the most loyal of his subordinates doubt his judgment. The captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to attack the city of Mysidia and take the Water Crystal from innocent magicians who protect it. When Cecil questions the king&apos;s orders, he is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to deliver a package to the village of Mist, accompanied by his best friend Kain, the captain of the dragoons. Little does he realize that the king&apos;s inexplicable behavior is but a part of a much larger picture, which he is yet to reveal. The fourth entry in the Final Fantasy series was released as Final Fantasy II in the West, because the second and the third games were not released there at the time. The game is a Japanese-style RPG with top-down world map navigation, automatic leveling up, and random enemy encounters. The game introduces a system called ATB (active-time battle). While combat is turn-based in its core, the game does not pause when the player accesses the battle menu. Enemies continue to act in real time regardless of the actions of the player-controlled party. The turns of the participants are calculated depending on their agility rating. Each player-controlled character has a special bar that gradually refills itself; said character may act when the bar is full. Unlike all the previous Final Fantasy games, the fourth installment does not allow the player to customize the characters&apos; abilities and classes. Each character belongs to a specific, clearly defined class- dragoon, white mage, black mage, summoner, ninja, etc. Each of these classes has distinct special abilities or magic spells. New abilities are learned automatically when a character reaches a pre-determined level. Characters join and leave the party as dictated by the game&apos;s plot events. The active party includes up to five combatants. The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.</story>

    <story>Final Fantasy IX tells the story of Zidane, the member of a team of theater actors who also happen to be a gang of thieves, and Garnet, the princess of Alexandria. Zidane and his buddies first plan to kidnap Garnet from her mother&apos;s palace. But shortly after the kidnapping, they realize the queen of Alexandria is up to something evil. Zidane, the princess, and other characters they encounter on their journey decide to join forces and to find out what can possibly drive the queen to commit her cruel deeds. The game is set in a medieval environment and generally looks more like the first games of the series than its two immediate predecessors. It utilizes the classic ATB (active time battle) combat system, and revives the class-based gameplay of earlier Final Fantasies - each character belongs to a certain class and uses his/her own unique attacks. Weapons, armor, and accessories allow you to choose and to gradually learn various abilities (magic spells, immunity to certain status changes, etc.) by participating in battles while equipping them. Returning from Final Fantasy VIII is the card game, now called Tetra Master. Cards are now placed on a 4x4 grid, and can attack other cards on diagonals as well as cardinal directions. Cards no longer have set stats, and instead have a range of values and arrow positions, making every card unique. Regional rule variations are gone, but at the start of every match one to five positions on the grid will be blacked out, changing your offensive and defensive strategies with every game.</story>

    <story>Final Fantasy Tactics was a big move for the whole Final Fantasy franchise into different fields. Tactics combines traditional elements of the Final Fantasy series with a completely different game mechanics and battle system. It was the 1st game during Final Fantasy 32-bit era using a 3D, isometric, rotatable playing field, with bitmap sprite characters and a turn based strategy system. In the game you build up a team by recruiting many available characters you meet during your travels and stocking up plenty of items, to defeat various enemies waiting on your path. The game features a very complex character class(job) system where each character begins his way with a job such as Squire or Chemist. Successfully participating in battles, characters can later select one of more advanced jobs, with a total of 19 to choose from. In addition there are certain monsters and computer controlled guests with their own jobs and special abilities available to learn. In total, over 400 abilities are available which leads to ultimate endless combinations! The PSP version of game are mostly reiterates the original PSOne. For example, the visual presentation is almost a 1-1 copy of the original. It looks like PSOne version with zoomed-in camera to make it fit the PSP screen. However Square adds cel-shaded introduction movies and numerous animation sequences played after each chapter ends. Some maps were completely remade as well, but you still cannot skip event scenes. Also PSP version features two new playable characters- Balthier, from Final Fantasy XII and Luso from Final Fantasy Tactics A2. Two new job classes also have been added - the completely new Onion Knight and the Dark Knight class which was available on the PSOne only after using a cheat code. There are two wireless multiplayer options available once you reach the world map (just go into a bar in any town). One is Coliseum (Versus Battle Mode), the second is Cooperative Challenge (team-mission).</story>

    <story>The seventh installment of the Final Fantasy series takes place in a post-modern, steampunk, sci-fi world where high technology reigns and where robots and bio-engineered mutants co-exist with humans and dragons. The story focuses on Shinra Inc., an evil mega-corporation responsible for all the world&apos;s high technology. Shinra supports this technology with Mako Energy, Shinra&apos;s patented source of power. Unfortunately Mako is the lifeblood of the living planet and by using it up Shinra is slowly upsetting the balance of nature. In comes AVALANCHE, a rebel group of disenfranchised citizens who have taken it upon themselves to oppose Shinra&apos;s ambitions. The main character is an ex-Shinra soldier named Cloud Strife, an angst ridden fella with a complex history that&apos;s explained as the game goes on. Cloud joins up with AVALANCHE as a mercenary for hire, and together they take on Shinra&apos;s maniacal executives and their army of shock-troops, robots, and mutants. However after a while it becomes apparent that there are other forces at work, and ultimately Cloud must not only fight against Shinra, but also stop a powerful man from his past from destroying the world. Final Fantasy VII updates the Esper character growth system from Final Fantasy VI into the Materia system. Instead of magic spells, abilities, and bonus stats being saved to a single character, they are saved to the materia itself, allowing you to change a character&apos;s spells and abilities from the equipment menu at any time. Also updated from VI are character-specific abilities, now called Limit Breaks. By sustaining enough damage without dying a character will build up their Limit Gauge, which when filled can be expended to do a much more damaging attack than normal. More powerful Limit Breaks are unlocked as previous ones are used, and acquiring the most powerful Limit Break of each character will require completion of sub-quests. Final Fantasy VII also features plenty of mini-games and many ways to explore the game world, including the submarine first introduced in Final Fantasy III.</story>

Party members can be customized by equipping them with magic spells, which can be drawn from enemies in battles. When used in combat, this spells act like expandable items; there are no MP (magic points) in the game. The trademark summoned monsters (called Guardian Forces in this game) play a very important role in the customization process. They can be junctioned to to the characters, acquire experience points of their own, learn and teach characters new abilities, and naturally also be summoned in battles. As the previous installment, Final Fantasy VIII features several mini-games, the most prominent of which is the card game Triple Triad. Cards can be won in matches or acquired through side quests or by transforming enemy monsters. Many characters in the game can be challenged to a game of Triple Triad, so it is always possible to take a break from saving the world to play cards with the locals.</story>

Party members can be customized by equipping them with magic spells, which can be drawn from enemies in battles. When used in combat, this spells act like expandable items; there are no MP (magic points) in the game. The trademark summoned monsters (called Guardian Forces in this game) play a very important role in the customization process. They can be junctioned to to the characters, acquire experience points of their own, learn and teach characters new abilities, and naturally also be summoned in battles.

    <story>Welcome to the Firebugs racing season, where teams of different worlds send their best racer to compete for fame and glory. Play as Gismo, Karrie, Zero, BOW or Kami - each with a background story, unique special weapon, and alternate vehicle designs that can be unlocked. You race in five distinct worlds- a group of linked islands (Archipelago), a droid factory (Droid Gardens), a desert wasteland (Terrian Dunes), an industrial area (Sky Port) and a wealthy city (Aerial City). While racing, the personal weapon is stored in the left weapon bay. Random weapons that can be picked up by all racers are stored on the right. There are both offensive and defensive specials, including missiles, rockets, cannons, turbo, shield and a worm hole that teleports your opponents. Upon completing a perfect lap, you receive a special weapon, such as the stasis beam (immobilization) or the time warp (slow opponents down). Vehicles can be slowed down but not destroyed, so he who crosses the finish line first still takes it all. The game uses 360° aerodynamics, which allow you to drive on walls and ceilings. Those game mechanics were previously used in ATD&apos;s Rollcage series. The single player mode includes championships divided over three leagues with increasing difficulty. Each league contains five worlds, with a different theme, and each character has a homeworld. There are qualifier races, heats (one-on-one) and final races where the grid is based on the results of the previous races. You can also test drive all 25 tracks in the practice mode, or go head-to-head with split-screen multiplayer. The game&apos;s soundtrack is provided by the Bomfunk MCs.</story>

When it&apos;s quitting time, his boss threatens him with summary termination if he does not finish his trench-digging assignment by the next morning. The biggest dilemma for Fred is that he needs to practice for an upcoming bowling tournament. The benevolent alien named The Great Gazoo materializes and solves the problem by digging a trench and lining it with giant bowling pins. He then gives Fred a large bowling ball half shell in which to play live action bowling. The action in Bedrock Bowling takes the form of steering the bowling shell down 8 different lanes. Each lane has 10 pins that the player must try to hit. Additionally, there are many diamonds, birds, and other powerups along the way to be collected for points. The 8 lanes are Gravel Factory, Quarry, Flooded, Tar, Freeway, Crystal Mine, Lava, and Rockzilla.</story>

Gameplay tends to go towards arcade action rather than simulations, as there are not many customization options and maneuvers such as drafting are useless thanks to the physics engine. Supports quick race and season gameplay in both simulation and arcade modes, as well as multiplayer support for up to 8 players. Graphics are entirely 3d with weather effects included and the game features commentary by BBC commentator Murray Walker.</story>

    <story>By the developers of the realistic Sony Formula One series, Formula One Arcade is also an officially licensed product, but the racing itself is unrealistic with many arcade elements. Players choose formula one cars and race other drivers on various courses, checkpoint-based with the clock counting down. Unlike the other games in the series however, the racing is very hectic and there are power-ups such as speed boosts, shields (invincibility), large tires (more grip) and more.</story>

    <story>Earth has been rendered largely uninhabitable by an explosion caused by a bungled experiment. Few would dare to brave its unstable and searing environments - only those determined to grab a little of its remaining gold. You are one of those, taking your hover-bike into disintegrating caverns for a few hours of dangerous work which, successful or not, will be your last. Forsaken is a first-person shoot &apos;em up in which you have complete movement freedom in 3 dimensions, as you accelerate, swerve and strafe your craft, making for gameplay resembling Descent. Each level has a defined exit which must be reached within a tight time limit. The surrounding areas are collapsing around you, with spikes and turbine fans among your hazards. Be very aware of other craft out to take all you have, as they alter their approach based on your weaponry (from the 25 featured in the game) and past encounters. On the PC, multiplayer action can feature up to 12 human players. The Nintendo 64 version featured 4 player split-screen multiplayer, while the Playstation version has no multiplayer options.</story>

They all have their own special weapon to give them an edge in the races. There are 32 races which are organised by a mad doctor who hopes to find the ultimate soldier among these micro maniacs. The Playstation version is completely in 3D. In good Micro Machines tradition, the races are all held in and around the house, including the garage, living room, bathroom, study and deck.</story>

    <story>Yokosuka, Japan, 2112 AD. The young student Kazuki Takemura works as a test pilot with Kirishima Industries, a production company of military battle wanzers (walking panzers), mechanized walking robots with movement similar to that of a human being. Kazuki has just finished testing the combat capabilities of the new Zeinslev prototype in the lab. Finishing his day&apos;s tasks he is asked by his best friend Ryogo to help with a company delivery to the Japanese Defense Force (JDF) military based. This simple choice determines where Kazuki is when strange things begin happening in Japan. A large explosion, a wanzer theft, his sister Alysia being hunted, rumors of a powerful weapon, and accusations of involvement by agents of both the OCU and the USN all make the situation more complicated. Kazuki is swept up in a plot of conflicting loyalties and attacked by various factions. He will need to recruit additional characters and wanzers in order to be victorious in battle and investigate leads to uncover what is going on. Front Mission 3, like other games in the Front Mission Series is a turn-based strategy game featuring real-time environments, CG movies, mechanized robots and strategic battles. The game contains two independent storylines with different situations, environments and unique characters made up of different set of allies and enemies. The majority of the game takes place on the battlefield where Kazuki and his allies are controlled in an overhead view 3D environment. The game is tactical and nature, so the player chooses his unit and assigns where it will be moved and what action it will perfom. Typical actions include attacking with a shoulder weapon (missiles or gernades), attacking with a weapon held in the hand (ranged and melee), using items, guarding against future attack and simply ending the turn. As chaarcters fire weapons back and forth at each other, they will inflict damage to different parts of the wanzer. Areas that can be damaged and destroyed/disabled include arms, legs, and body. Complete damage to the body will &apos;destroy&apos; the wanzer in battle, whereas disabling other parts will merely render it less effective. Each weapon has a damage type which includes (I) Impact, (F) Flame and (P) Piercing. In practice these types function as weapon elements which can be reduced with the proper armor coating, however it usually renders it vulnerable to another damage type. Typically Anti-I defense is very weak against Class-P attack and defending against that is weak from Class-F and defending against that is weak from Class-I. Each weapon carried by the wanzers is also classified as either Ranged, Melee, Shield or Missile . Each pilot can have a proficiency in these skills, making the usage of some weapons by them more effective than others. Pilots also learn special skills during battle, these are activated by experience points, and amount of weapon usage. Special abilities are very dependent on the types of actions being performed and items equipped, so for example the ability Double Shot requires a weapon equipped in each hand of the same weapon class. Between combat missions, Kazuki is able to save his game as well as explore the network. The network is a virtual internet, allowing connections to the (completely fictional) websites of organizations involved in the Front Mission 3 plot. While exploration on the network is not required, it&apos;s exploration will uncover clues to some of the game&apos;s backstory as well as open up the opportunity to develop email contacts, obtain additional funds and unlock new wanzer gear. Between certain missions, Kazuki will enter a town. These are represented by a simple graphical menu of different locations. Areas that can be visited typically include Pubs, Wanzer Equipment Shops, Wanzer Parts Shops and specific locations. Wanzers are mix-and-matchable so that feet from one model can be attached to another and different weapons carried. Different wanzer parts each have unique values for HP, accuracy, movement and armor. However each part and weapon has a weight value, which is determined by each individual Wanzer model&apos;s engine (as well as additional parts). A wanzer is always unable to carry more than it&apos;s maximum weight. Towns are also where Kazuki will often meet new characters and have conversations to uncover the plot.</story>

    <story>A home version of the arcade game of the same name, Galaxian 3 allows up to four players to blast away at oncoming enemy fighters from a first-person perspective. In a similar vein to Atari&apos;s 1983 Star Wars arcade game, the computer is actually flying the ship, and the players are simply gunners given plenty to shoot at. In addition to bringing home the coin-op&apos;s Project Dragoon scenario, another entire mission, The Rising Of Gourb, is also included. This mission allows players to follow up their recent rescue of the Earth with a desperate mission to save another world from the alien menace. Galaxian3 has little or no connection to Namco&apos;s Galaxian coin-op classic, and the PlayStation edition is only available as a Japanese import, despite the fact that it did make it to some U.S. arcades. Inspired by the walk-in theatrical-style arcade game, Galaxian3 is a blast-fest for up to four players. While the computer does the flying in this first-person shooter, the players are trigger-happy gunners with plenty of alien ships crowding the sky as targets. Everything, from stationary gun platforms on enormous alien command ships to agile fighters, is fair game. Occasionally reactors and other strategic targets must be hit, including one sequence that bears a bit of resemblance to a certain chase through a certain Death Star. The complete arcade game is included, along with an original second mission involving an alien planet that must be saved. </story>

    <story>Gallop Racer is part horse racing simulation, part action/arcade racer. When choosing horses for your stable, you have to take a lot of factors into account. For instance, is the horse a long or short distance runner? Does it do better on a dry track or a wet track? The factors appear to be endless at first. After you have your horse, you then get to race it. Unlike several horse racing games from this time, you get to control the horse on the track instead of just watching. Actually, you really control the jockey. The controls basically boil down to hitting the face buttons when you need to get the horse moving; similar to riding the horse in The Ocarina of Time, only without the turning. However, you can&apos;t drive the horse on for the entire race, or else it&apos;ll tire and you&apos;ll be left in the dust. Once the race is over, you get your cash. Each place earns you a specific amount, which you can then use to improve your ranks of race horses. If you&apos;d rather not spend more money, you can also breed them, creating a &amp;quot;super racing horse&amp;quot; from two exceptional racers. The horse isn&apos;t really super, but it will almost certainly have a prolific career.</story>

    <story>As many as four (Expansion Pak required) can band together in an epic quest through seven magical worlds -- three of which are brand-new to the home version -- to defeat the vile Skorne. The nonlinear action begins in a hub, which leads to the worlds, each with two to five levels. You can complete a level in one world, then move to another world, returning later to finish a new level in the first world. Developer Atari Games has delivered four new characters in addition to the four in the arcade version. Each character will have unique special attacks. Controller Pak support will allow players to team their evolving characters. Enemies, bosses, power-ups, music and sound effects are all getting radical makeovers. Atari is busily remapping carryover levels and cooking up devious new puzzles and hiding places for items, so don&apos;t even think of cribbing from the coin-op version. Graphical updates include real-time lighting, which is nowhere to be found in the arcade version. The N64 Expansion Pak pushes plenty of polygon-based enemies onto the screen. The essential action -- team up with others, find keys, magic, runes and other items, and beat the stuffing out of anyone in your way -- remains unchanged from the arcade hit. Atari has delivered a far meatier storyline, though, spiffed up by cinema cut-scenes at the successful conclusion of a world.</story>

Instead, players of the game must write down the scores each driver receives after each race, and then add them up manually at the end of the Final Race to see if they have become the Drivers World Champion. The Four Race Championship Season consists of Rounds 10, 13, 14, and 16 from the 1994 season. These tracks are Hungary in Budapest , Portugal in Estoril, Spain at Jerez, and Australia at Adelaide. The races consist of either 3 or 5 Laps, depending on the players preference; and one can choose from three modes of difficulty- Novice, Amateur and Professional. The game pits you in the Seat of Eddie Irvine&apos;s 1998 Ferrari, (the man who ended the 1999 season as Vice-Champion). The game however, does not allow you to switch to another car, so you must remain as the Irishman, although you can change the &apos;Driver Name&apos;. </story>

    <story>The first game in the Gran Turismo series of racing simulations. You can choose between the arcade version (featuring classic cars such as Corvettes and Aston Martins) or the simulation, which is the true heart of the game. The simulation starts you on an entire racing career beginning with a cheap used car and second-rate tracks. You will find yourself longing for the Dodge Viper as your sad $10,000 starting fund puts you behind the wheel of a used Honda Prelude or Mazda RX-7. As you win races, acquire money, and earn advanced licenses, you are able to buy better cars and race in more competitive matches right up to the GT World Cup. Features more than 140 cars.</story>

    <story>Grand Slam Baseball was an innovative, albeit relatively low-key release from Virgin Interactive Entertainment in 1997. Not known for sports games, VIE released Grand Slam for Windows, Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn as the second title in its attempt to establish a mainstream sports line. The first title in the short-lived line was Power Play Hockey in 1996. The sports line would last only one more title after Grand Slam&apos;s release, that being the sequel to the hockey game, also released in 1997. Grand Slam was one of the early adopters of 3D accelerator card technology and also offered full 3D play in software alone. The Playstation and Saturn versions were 3D by default. Grand Slam introduced a few play mechanics to video game baseball that would later prove to be fixtures in the genre. The most notable in this area was the introduction of a meter for pitching, used to control the velocity and accuracy of pitches, similar to the familiar swing meter in popular golf games. This meter was later borrowed and made popular by titles such as EA&apos;s MVP Baseball. On the batting side of things, a similar metered approach was used. This was inspired by older arcade baseball games that allowed the player to load up a swing&apos;s power with a control stick before releasing it as the pitch came in. Other highlights amongst Grand Slam&apos;s feature set included- - A trade AI engine that would examine the needs of a team and decide if a proposed trade was in its best interest. - Catcher AI and pitch signals, helping a player learn how to pitch to each batter&apos;s strengths and weaknesses. - Attention to details and baseball flavor, such as players that would blow bubble gum bubbles during an at bat, light- hearted commentary, an All Star Break during season play (complete with a working voting ballot), and an in-game JumboTron scoreboard that would show animations after home runs.</story>

Instead of the fictional interpretations of New York, Miami and Los Angeles of the original, this game opens up the city of London to the player. The game features thirty new vehicles, new graphics and thirty-two new missions; all in a distinctly British theme. The new city contains many familiar landmarks from London in the late 60s as well as other cultural reference and Cockney slang. This time the player can choose the avatar&apos;s appearance, otherwise gameplay has not been changed from the original game. The player still is involved in organized crime and must perform a variety of criminal activities.</story>

    <story>In Grand Theft Auto, the player takes the role of a small-time criminal trying to make it big with the mob. Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are the way to success. The action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city- Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the big points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple ditch-a-hot-car jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points. Criminal behavior comes with a price of course- if policemen witness a crime, the player&apos;s wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered. The entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items- extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted). Dozens of different vehicles are available for the taking, each with unique characteristics- a bus will handle very differently than a sports car.</story>

    <story>Grandia is a Japanese-style console RPG, with big-eyed anime style characters, that was first released on the Sega Saturn in 1997. It centers around the story of a young hero named Justin who possesses a mysterious artifact known as the &apos;Spirit Stone&apos;. The story takes Justin and friends (who range from a bratty eight year-old to a noble knight and a thief with a short fuse) through distant towns and abandoned ruins of a forgotten civilization (and even the occasional military base) in a search for adventure and secrets long hidden from the world. Grandia makes use of FMV cut-scenes to advance the story. The characters are represented by 2D sprites which are moved around over 3D backgrounds in towns and dungeons. Combat is initiated by coming into contact with enemies on the screen, rather than through random battles. Combat itself occurs in pseudo-real-time, using an &apos;IP Gauge&apos; to determine when a character takes action. Striking at the right time or with the right ability can even delay or cancel an enemy&apos;s turn. The characters in the game gradually advance in level as they gain experience points for killing monsters. Characters also gain experience based on the weapon (e.g. sword, mace, whip, etc.) or magic (e.g. fire, water, etc.) that they use, powering up their spells and learning new ones from continuous usage. There are a large number of spells, weapons, and other items to use throughout the game.</story>

Players choose a vehicle (which represents a gang) with each coming with their own distinctive weapons such as shield draining bombs, energy megabolts, corrosive sulfur gas bombs and, mini-thermonuclear warheads. Each of the 23 missions contain power-ups such as invulnerability, invisibility, double damage, nitro boosts, and guided missile lock jammers. Powerups are earned after collecting a number of tokens scattered throughout each mission. There is also a 2 player split screen combat mode where two players can fight against each other.</story>

    <story>In 22th century, the scientists, learning the ancient ways of magic, discovered a new technique that made it possible to create artificial beings by mixing the DNA of humans and animals. Those new creatures were called gears. They had no will of their own and were destined to obey the humans forever. However, a gear named Justice was, for a mysterious reason, capable of disobeying the humans and making decisions of his own. He organized a rebellion of gears, that was later repressed by the knights of the Sacred Order, who put him in a prison. But recently, Justice broke free, and the Order organized a tournament to find out who is capable of hunting him down again. Among the main contestant is a man with unclear past, Sol Badguy, and his rival Ky Kiske, one of the most skilled knights of the order. The conditions of the tournament are, however, very strange. It is allowed to spill blood, and the first prize is also not very usual- any wish of the winner will be fulfilled... This is a 2D fighting game, in which you can play as one of 10 very different kind of characters. There is a selection of fighters from Holy Order knights, Armed Air Force soldiers, Mafia members and mad scientists. Each character has his/her own storyline that will be fully revealed during the final showdown. In battles, you can charge up for special attacks, as well as perform Deathblow moves, which would kill the opponent instantly. You can either choose to finish the Arcade mode, challenge your friends to a Versus battle, or either train your skills out in the Training mode.</story>

In the story mode, Heero can pilot any of the available mobile suits to do battle with his enemies. Each suit has its own set of special moves and a super attack. Some of the weapon based special attacks use ammunition which can eventually run out. The super attack can only be used 3 times during each fight. Each suit also has thrusters that can be used to fly in the air a bit. On the defensive side, players can dodge attacks by sidestepping and also can utilize a beam shield which can be used to protect the player from projectile attacks. Mobile suits come with 3 life bars total and fights are decided by trying to deplete all the life bars of an enemy mobile suit. The game also contains a 2 player versus mode. Options allow the player to choose their difficulty level and also let them set the timer during a match to either on or off.</story>

The game features standard fighting game mechanics, with punches, kicks and a variety of combo moves that can be executed by each Gundam. Note that the Mobile Suits aren&apos;t as mobile as humans, and thus the fighters&apos; movements are slower and their maneuverability is worse than in most fighting games. The game has several playing modes, which must be unlocked by using different Mobile Suits on the various difficulty levels. The available modes are- street mode, story mode, versus (a single duel where you can choose your opponent), two time attack modes (where you must defeat either 8 regular enemies or 4 boss enemies as fast as possible) and survival (defeat as many enemies as possible; fight until you beat all of them, or until one of them beats you.)</story>

But fate works against them - Zee is kidnapped by a posse of bandits, and Cole is slain.

But doing this leaves you vulnerable to attack, so you must be careful to not get hit. The game features a full-fledged story mode, as well as a no-frills arcade mode and a series of mini-games to keep you interested in the game.</story>

    <story>Gungage is a futuristic Third Person Shooter for the PlayStation. In the game, the world is threatened by strange creatures from an alternative world called Dark Moon, who want to take over the Earth. You start the game with only one character available to play with, but three more can be unlocked. Each character has its own characteristics when it comes to the size of their gun, their speed, and their size. Each character also has their own special psychic powers. The story evolves differently with the various characters, but the same levels are used. During the game, special powers have to be collected. Settings of the various levels in the game vary from deserts to laboratories. Enemies in the game vary from prehistoric looking beast to futuristic robots and tanks. Enemies can run around, pop out of the ground, fly in the air, and come out of the water. Levels are completed by confronting and defeating a giant level boss. The game can be played in easy, medium, and hard mode.</story>

    <story>An update to Gunship 2000. This updated game now includes full textures on all 3D objects. The game features two game modes. The Quick Fire game mode has the player piloting a helicopter, trying to take out as many enemy targets as they can. There is also a campaign mode where players can tackle various day and night missions in either Central Europe or the Persian Gulf. Missions range from destroying enemy convoys to taking out enemy platoons. Players start out as a greenhorn and can only do training or single scenario missions at first. The player can eventually get promoted to campaign scenario missions where they can also get to control a complete squad of five copters. The game features flyable versions of the AH-64A Apache, UH-60K Blackhawk, AH-66B Comanche and four other authentic U.S. Army attack helicopters. Copters can be equipped with unguided weapons like rockets and machine guns and guided weapons like Hellfire, Sidewinder, and Stinger missiles which are used to take out both air and ground targets. Copters can be flown from either a cockpit view or from a chase view. The game also has other camera views such as the remote view or the tactical view.</story>

    <story>From Argonaut, developers of the first Harry Potter game for PlayStation, comes the sequel, with mostly the same gameplay style and mechanics. To master his second year at magic school Hogwarts and discover the mystery behind the Chamber of Secrets, Harry must make his way through a 3D action adventure. The game is more varied than its predecessor. In addition to platforming and maze sections, where magic must be used to fight monsters and solve puzzles, there are a variety of mini-games, like de-gnoming a garden by throwing gnomes over a fence or catching falling pipes thrown by a ghoul. There are also some unique action sequences, including traveling by floo powder, which entails sliding down a narrow path at high speed, or fleeing from the Hogwarts Express in a flying car. As in the first game, there are also Quidditch matches. Another big part of the game are wizarding duels- these take the form of a best-of-three bout, where the two wizards zap each other with magic while trying to evade the other&apos;s spells until one duelist&apos;s health is down. Also returning from the first game are collectible Every Flavour Beans and Famous Wizard Cards. The beans act as currency to buy cards, while the cards themselves are required to access certain duels.</story>

    <story>One of several different games based on the first Harry Potter book and movie, the version for the PlayStation is a three-dimensional action adventure. To complete his first year of studies at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and foil the evil Lord Voldemort&apos;s plans, Harry must complete a number of challenges. These include platform sequences, made easy because Harry jumps automatically when reaching edges. There are combat scenes, where Harry has to knock out or drive back enemies. Some challenges require the player to solve puzzles. Harry can use five different spells, which have to be learned in class first. Successful completion of the tasks often results in house points for Harry&apos;s house Gryffindor; failure in some deducts points, so the race for the House Cup can stay open until the end. There is also broomstick flying in the game, both in Quidditch matches, where Harry has to catch the Golden Snitch by flying through rings that it leaves behind, and on other occasions, like chasing Draco Malfoy and knocking him off his broom. Exploring Hogwarts is often rewarding, as many optional challenges and secret rooms await, often with rewards like a special item or collectibles like Famous Wizard cards and Every Flavor Beans. The beans can be traded for passwords that open up more hidden areas.</story>

When four or more of the same blocks are together, they vanish. The catch of this variant is that the blocks which have to be removed move over the playfield.

Gameplay is similar to Capcom&apos;s Resident Evil series, with adventure-game dialogue and puzzles punctuated with fights.

    <story>The future Tokyo is a megapolis built on top of a huge system of underground tunnels and sewers. A rumor is heard that in this underground world hide the followers of a mysterious cult, known as the Dark Messiah. At the same time a symbiotic life form escapes from scientists and makes it&apos;s way into the sewer system. There it causes the crash of a subway train and starts devouring the passengers on board. A lone hero, along with a schoolgirl Naomi Sugiura are the only survivors of the crash.... and must flee from the creature in order to survive. Hellnight is a survival horror game at heart, although it has no combat gameplay. Controlling the nameless hero, the player must travel through the underground and protect Naomi. There is only one monster in the whole game, the creature itself, which is invulnerable and cannot be killed. Instead players are constantly on the run from it, making sure it does not catch them. The game is divided into large maze-like levels, each one usually populated by the creature who keeps pursuing the player (although he does change form after each level). At certain points there will be companions who can attack the monster and temporarily stun him. There are also people to talk to in the underground world, items to pick up, and puzzles to solve.</story>

Three humans have managed to escape with their lives and now seek vengeance against the Serpent Rider Korax who remains in their world. Like Heretic, Hexen is a fantasy game based on an enhanced DOOM engine. All of Heretic&apos;s innovations like vertical looking, flying, and the inventory system have been carried over. The new major changes this time around are three characters for the player to choose from and the level hub system. The characters are the Fighter, the Cleric, and the Mage. Each one has four unique weapons and different levels of speed and armor. The hub system steps away from the traditional single levels stringed along into episodes system which had been carried over into the FPS genre from sidescrollers and made popular by Wolfenstein 3D. In Hexen&apos;s hub system each episode is still made up of interconnected levels, but most of the levels are connected to a single hub level through portals. There are also portals between some of the spoke levels. Many of the puzzles in Hexen require travel back and forth between different levels. Other innovations in Hexen included weather effects, jumping, earth-quakes, and destructible objects such as trees and vases.</story>

    <story>A futuristic racing game with hover cars, in the same line as Wipeout, using a modified version of the Magic Carpet 2 engine. Gameplay takes a straightforward approach, with the directional keys controlling the steering and throttle, and three keys to fire the minigun, missiles or charge the booster. While the minigun has unlimited ammo, both fuel, armour and missiles must be replenished by passing through some marked areas or picking up powerups in the track or by left destroyed opponents. While the vehicles float on the track they are still influenced by the ground material- they slow down on dirt and even more on water. Each track has a number of shortcuts or alternate routes that offer powerups, and some tracks feature gates and ramps that open or close randomly. Includes 9 tracks and several game modes (for Saturn owners and PC players with the 1.2 patch installed) such as single race mode (with option to change the number of laps), a Championship mode, Split Screen, Clone Race (beating the ghost of the best race time), Death Match (Where instead of finishing first what matters is finish alive and with the most kills) and Hot Seat, where up to eight players can compete in the same race by taking turns, with the computer taking control of the players&apos; vehicles waiting for their turn. There are six hover cars to choose from- the fast Flexiwing and Outrider, the balanced KD-1 Speeder and Vampyr and the slow but armed to the teeth Berserker and Jugga. In addition to the natural capacity of each, their Minigun, Missle and Booster capacities can be upgraded by picking up powerups during the race. There are Eight teams to choose from, which change the colour of the vehicle- Mad Medicine (white), Bullfrog (aqua green), Storm Riders (purple), Fire Phreaks (orange), DethFest (blue), Foo Fighters (yellow), Gorehounds (red) and Assassins Anonymous (black).</story>

    <story>In Hooters Road Trip, the player takes control of a muscle car, competing in races and different skill tests sponsored by Hooters Restaurants, a popular food and bar franchise in the U.S. that employs well-endowed women, in locations such as California and Florida. The gameplay mostly consisted of racing against computer opponents while avoiding oncoming traffic, such as other cars and semi-trucks. The winner of these races will get to meet a real Hooters Girl (video wise of course), chosen for the game for each state they actually live (i.e., if they player wins a race in Florida, the player will get to see a Hooters Girl from a restaurant in Florida). There are 12 different cars to choose from, some of which need to be unlocked by winning certain races. Players can also race against each other in two-player action while the graphics are reminiscent of Destruction Derby.</story>

In the game the player takes the role of the futuristic bounty hunter that have to chase some prisoners in a military facility and you have to shoot the enemies until reaching the number requird to end the level. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen decreased as foes are killed. The bad parts of the game is that it looks more like a demo because the player doesn&apos;t have a good control method and the tanks energy got full again when the player is killed... </story>

    <story>Hot Shots Golf 2&apos; is the sequel to the very popular and critically acclaimed PlayStation game, &apos;Hot Shots Golf&apos;. While the sequel is in many respects similar to the original, it brings some improvements to the series. Like the original there are several characters to choose from, and many more to be unlocked throughout the game. Each character has his or her own strengths and weaknesses, making character selection more than just choosing a skin. The character models themselves are of a more realistic style this time around, as opposed to the big-head anime style of the original &apos;Hot Shots Golf&apos;. There are several different modes of play, from standards like stroke, match, and tournament, to the &apos;vs. mode&apos;, through which new characters can be unlocked. Gameplay itself is a version of the standard &apos;tap-tap-tap&apos; variety used by the majority of golf games.</story>

    <story>Based on the Hot Wheels toy car collection, this racing game takes you on a wild ride though various, rather filthy, environments, fighting opponents to finish first in each race. The basic gameplay is similar to most racing games. The player controls a car and races around tracks as fast as possible. By collecting pick-ups new properties can be obtained, such as nitro boosts, oil slicks, projectiles and other weapons. The computer-controlled cars can also collect the pick-ups and use them. Cars have the ability to transform into four different types of vehicles- racing, truck, plane and boat. While transforming the body of the car stays the same while the side of the car grows wheels, wings or fins. The stages are divided into different parts, each designed for a specific vehicle. The parts are separated by a transformation portal. When the player drives though such a portal the car will change into another type.</story>

Ever helpful Hugo sets off on an adventure through the Swamp, Jungle, Crystal Grotto and the Factory in a quest to free the frogs... Hugo is hanging out with his friends, the Kikus, and peacefully sitting at the edge of the Jungle at dusk, they chat and laugh. A happy tune plays in the background and the frogs go ´Ribbit´ - as frogs do best. Suddenly, the sound of the frogs turns into a virtual racket, only to come to a halt that leaves Hugo and the Kikus listening to the deafening sound of ... silence. As they look beyond the edge of the Jungle to the swamp, they see two of Don Croco´s soldiers sailing away with all the frogs in great big nets.The frogs are clearly destined to end their days as a banquet delicacy! But Hugo is troll enough for the challenge and, together with the player, he sets out to rescue the frogs from their looming fate. Frog Fighter is a variation on the classic Frogger game concept. All action takes place on one screen at a time, as with the old arcade games.The game is so simple that children will intuitively pick it up and play. The game levels are built on different platforms, where players will find the cages with the captured frogs as well as keys to open the cages. Once a key has been picked up or a frog has been freed, a new key or cage will spawn in its place. Frog Fighter will be a favourite of parents and their children alike, ensuring many hours of fun and action in the company of our friendly troll - Hugo. </story>

    <story>Hunchback of Notredame is a novel by Victor Hugo published in 1831. The title refers to the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, which the story is centered around. The story dates back to January 6, 1482, the day of the &apos;Festival of Fools&apos; in Paris. Quasimodo, the deformed bell ringer, is introduced by his crowning as Pope of Fools. Esmeralda, a beautiful Gypsy with a kind and generous heart, captures the hearts of many men but especially those of Quasimodo and his adopted father, Claude Frollo. Frollo is torn between his lust and the rules of the church. He orders Quasimodo to get her. Quasimodo is caught and whipped and ordered to be tied down in the heat. Esmeralda, seeing his thirst, offers him water. It saves her, for she captures the heart of the hunchback. She is later accused of the attempted murder of Phoebus, whom Frollo attempted to kill in jealousy, and is sentenced to death by hanging. Quasimodo saves her by bringing her to the cathedral under the law of sanctuary. Clopin rallies the Truands (criminals of Paris) to charge the cathedral and rescue Esmeralda. The king, seeing the chaos, vetoes the law of sanctuary and commands his troops to take Esmeralda out and kill her. When Quasimodo sees the Truands, he assumes they are there to hurt Esmeralda, so he drives them off. Frollo betrays Esmeralda by handing her to the troops and watches while she is hanged. Quasimodo pushes him from Notre-Dame to his death. Quasimodo then goes to Mount Faucon (a huge graveyard in Paris where all hanged bodies are thrown), lies next to her corpse and eventually dies of starvation. One year later, excavationists find the skeletons of Esmeralda with a broken neck and Quasimodo locked in an embrace. </story>

Civilization as we know it was wiped out in the Third World War and the few scientists who survive in the aftermath struggle to make use of their skills to bring humanity back from the brink of extinction before it is too late. As one of several competing Hunters, the player quests through dangerously twisted post-apocalyptic lands in search of important technological relics and the bounties they will bring. It’s the very near future, and a gigantic war has wiped out much of mankind. The scientists who remain on the Earth’s surface want to create a formula to bring humanity back from the brink of extinction, but they’ll need important information that’s stored in the vaults of the world’s largest cities. The mission of retrieving the facts has been assigned to a highly skilled task force called the Hunters, and you’re among their elite. Compete with other Hunters and avoid deadly environmental elements as you try to become the first post-war hero by delivering the secrets to the right hands. Packed with hidden levels, special relics, and awesome power-ups, Battle Hunter (known as The Hunter in Europe) pits you against evil robots, mutated animals, and even some of your own friends! Battle Cards will help you get a leg up on the competition, and awesome action physics make the gameplay smooth and realistic. If you’re looking for an original challenge that lives up to its premise, check out BATTLE HUNTER. </story>

    <story>Port of Midway&apos;s arcade boat-racer. The premise is non-existent, you simply rev up the engines and go on 13 water courses set in Antarctica, the far east, the Greek isles, etc. on different types of futuristic boats. Races use the usual arcade checkpoint system and scattered across the courses you&apos;ll find an assortment of power-ups and upgrades like nitro boosters. Graphics are entirely 3D with reflective water effects and realistic bouncing and bucking in the boats. Multiplayer competitions are supported for 2 players on the PlayStation version.</story>

Up to four players can compete in Exhibition singles and doubles or rack up points on a World Tour of six tournaments (the Australian Open in Melbourne, the French Open in Paris, the Human Open in Tokyo, Mixed Doubles in Montreal, the US Open in New York and Wimbledon in London). Three different court surfaces (clay, grass, and hard court) affect the speed and bounce of balls hit. You get penalized for not connecting on your serve and must time your hits of returns as it will affect where the ball goes. Your player&apos;s movements are motion-captured and you can lunge at a ball if you are caught out of position. There&apos;s 9 different camera views to choose from. </story>

    <story>Fang was once a proud and rich city, until Baron Sukumvit took over. Under his rule, the city is known as the City of the Lost Souls. Deep inside the mountains surrounding the city, Baron Sukumvit built a labyrinth, named Deathtrap Dungeon, and used it to imprison his enemies. Filled with vulgarities, traps and disgusting monsters, the dungeon is a very dangerous place. With his enemies gone, the Baron now has opened up the dungeon to sport and sends willing heroes down into it&apos;s depths, betting on the likelihood of their survival. If anyone could survive all levels of the dungeon, and slay the red dragon Melkor, they would receive 10.000 gold pieces and Baron Sukumvit would renounce his rule over Fang. Two brave heroes- Red Lotus and Bandog, agree to these terms and enter the Deathtrap Dungeon... Deathtrap Dungeon is a 3rd person action game. Controlling either Red Lotus or Bandog, the player controls the character from behind with a camera mode like in Tomb Raider. To deal with the enemies encountered, there are three different kinds of attacks- melee weapons, range weapons and magic. The melee weapons include basic fists to normal swords to a magic enhanced war hammer. In the range weapons department are goodies like bombs or a flame-thrower. In terms of spells are magicks such as fireballs or rather crazy spells like the exploding pig. But the real challenge are of course the riddles, traps and abysses that are everywhere throughout the dungeon. During the journey, players will encounter many locked doors, that require the finding of keys and devices. There are also potions that regenerate health or provide immunity against fire for a limited amount of time. There are also several treasures hidden in the dungeon, finding them will increase the player&apos;s score at the end of the level. The player can save this game during a level by finding the various save points. The game also features the two multiplayer-modes- Deathmatch and Last Man Standing.</story>

    <story>With disregard for a background story, Funcom Dublin offers a Wipeout-esque mix of racing and driving at a very fast pace. Completing laps within the allotted time does not suffice, you also need to destroy a certain amount of vehicles. Contrary to the aforementioned title, you drive ordinary racing cars, if you count out the mounted weapons. These include mines, concussion missiles, smart bombs, heat-seeking missiles, lasers and firewalls. Some are provided by taking out enemies, but power-ups, time bonuses, energy, armor and a handicap that turns the screen upside-down, can also be collected. Five cars are available, with different statistics and built-in weapons. The initially weak weapon is soon replaced when you collect upgrade icons. To activate these, you have to complete a bonus stage after which you can also save your game. To add to the game&apos;s length, each of the twelve tracks, based on the settings city, mountain or space, has three variations- reverse, at night or the combination of the two. Other features include a small diagram showing approaching cars to time your mines, and pumping electronic tracks to match the game&apos;s pace.</story>

    <story>The Incredible Hulk is an isometric 3D action game. The popular Marvel comic book hero The Hulk returns to the PC, Playstation and Saturn systems to battle tons of lowly enemies and the occasional monstrous super-villain. When the lawful Pantheon society of superheroes kidnaps the green giant, he joins forces with his abductors and smashes through 13+2 isometric 3D levels (in a look reminiscent of the Loaded series of games). True to the comic books, the Hulk relies on no other weapons than his massive muscles to punch, kick and crush his enemies. When he has accumulated enough gamma energy, he may use powerful special moves like a Vortex Spin or the Floor Hammer. Rare bonus items also allow the Hulk to summon one of the four Pantheon team members Atalanta, Ulysses, Ajax and Hector to assist in the thick of battle. Most levels include at least one arch-enemy, such as Piecemeal, Trauma &amp; Lazarus or the U-Foes. Luckily, the Hulk’s regenerative powers allow him to regain health slowly. Little seems to be left of the Hulk’s legendary leaping capacity, however, so the green meat ball is forced to hop from platform to platform every now and then. You can find more information on The Incredible Hulk comic books in the trivia and links sections.</story>

    <story>This arcade game is based loosely on the 1996 blockbuster movie Independence Day. Interspersed with cutscenes lifted from the film, the game consists of flying a jet through various missions in order to take down the gargantuan, city-destroying spaceships. This entails flying around the 3D level and taking out targets such as- communication uplinks, shield generators, the occasional alien fighter craft, and ultimately bringing down the major alien ship via a strike on its main cannon. Powerups are plentiful, such as medical packs that heal your jetcraft, bonus weapons, bonus planes, and an item that freezes enemy planes for a brief time. Mission settings include the Grand Canyon, Washington D.C., and New York City. There are other missions that are provided on a need-to-know basis (as stated in the manual). The game also features 2-player head-to-head action via a network or null modem link.</story>

    <story>International Moto X simulates off-road motorcycle races. The main part of the game is the championship mode in which the player controls a 125cc motorcycle. There are various different leagues on different continents. At first the player creates his rider and sets the colour of his bike. More important is the tuning of the bike. It is possible to buy new dampers, tires or engines or update the ones already in use. Also there is a choice between three, four or five gears - inexperienced players can select automatic. During the race the goal is obviously to be the fastest rider by using all the tricks in the book - including stunts like wheelies, risky jumps, sliding or forcing the competition out of the way. There are several shortcuts to use but when the player is caught doing so, he is penalized. Winning a race results in prize money which can be reinvested in better gear. After winning all races in a league the player is allowed to ride in the 500cc league. Because the game is played in a 3rd person perspective there is no cockpit view - so all relevant data is shown in the upper left corner of the screen, including a mini map. Additionally there are two training modes, a time race and a training race against seven other riders on a course of choice. The game also features a scenery editor to create own courses but it not possible to save unfinished work. The competition editor allows the creation of new leagues with old or new courses.</story>

    <story>A baseball game featuring an Exhibition, Season, Playoff, Tournament, and a Home Run Derby mode. There is also a General Manager mode that lets the player create and trade players, and change team lineups. The game features the real MLB players and teams of that time. In the Playstation version, batting and pitching are both done from a behind the batter&apos;s viewpoint, while in the Windows version, the camera is more dynamic and is able to switch to both viewpoints. The Windows version is able to do this because of the Messiah technology being used, which allows for high-res Direct3D accelerated polygonal graphics. When batting the player can choose to either swing for contact or for power. The player can also choose a difficulty level for their batting. Rookie has the player timing their swing with the pitch, Pro adds the challenge of controlling the level of the swing, while selecting All-Star is basically the same as Pro, except the pitches come in at a faster rate of speed. When pitching, players can select different pitch types to throw depending on the ability of their pitcher. Players also can view a pitch chart that tracks every pitch thrown to each batter in the game. The game also features a play-by-play announcer and is able to keep track of the single season stats. This game is an update of VR Baseball 2000.</story>

You can also perform signature Jackie Chan moves like running up walls, cartwheel kicks, and even drunken Kung Fu. All of the moves are authentic, thanks to the motion-capture sessions with Jackie Chan himself. In addition to barehanded moves, any item that is not nailed down can be used as a weapon, just like a Jackie Chan movie.

    <story>Levant is a young boy from a village Syrus. Long time ago the country was cursed by a powerful spirit. Since then the forests around Syrus are populated by monsters. Levant&apos;s father was a Cocoon Master - a hunter who could capture those monsters, purge their corrupted souls through holy powers and make them serve the people. But Levant&apos;s father disappeared long ago in the woods, and now it&apos;s Levant&apos;s turn to be the new Cocoon Master. On the day of his initiation, which is also the day he marries his lovely girlfriend Mahbu, he receives his first dangerous mission. Jade Cocoon is, at its core, a Pokémon-like monster-breeding RPG. You must fight monsters and capture them once they become weak enough. Then you have to experiment and to cross different kinds of monsters with each other, to obtain more powerful species which you can later use in battles. The battles themselves are typical turn-based ones, with several menu choices, such as Attack, Defend,Catch or Item. The monsters are all visible.</story>

    <story>The third entry in the Jet Moto series once again places you in the driving seat of a futuristic hoverbike, racing at breakneck speed in a truly extreme sport. While a Jet Moto hoverbike might look like a jet ski, it is capable of far more- it travels across land as well as water and can use a magnetic grapple to make extremely tight turns. During a race, drivers must skillfully time jumps, dodge obstacles, and contend with some feisty opponents who won&apos;t hesitate to bump you into a tree or maybe even knock you off a cliff. Jet Moto 3 offers ten different riders and 19 tracks across the wide open ocean, over mountainous terrain, and through cityscapes. As with the earlier games, two people can still race in a split-screen mode.</story>

    <story>Jetracer is a one or two player game, four with multitap, in which players compete in performing tricks on jet skis. There are three modes of play all of which are basically the same. Freeride - where the player(s) can practice in any location on any machine Extreme Trick - where players compete in a match at any location on any machine Rider Championship - where players compete in a series of matches at different locations, this mode has a choice of skill settings. The players can choose between eight riders, four machines, and four locations. There is no &apos;create your own rider&apos; function nor can the machines be customised. Matches are played against other riders, if there is only one human player then the game provides three other riders to play against otherwise it&apos;s a player v player game. The players take it in turns to catch a wave and perform tricks such as cutbacks, big 720°, barrel riding etc. These are scored on the degree of difficulty and the process is repeated as many times as possible during the match time with just the best three scores being totalled to find the winner. Match time can vary between ten and forty minutes </story>

    <story>Licensed by snooker player Jimmy White, this game is a simulation of not only the British game of snooker, but also of the three main variations of pool. The game is viewed in detailed 3D, allowing you to rotate the table at all angles, either from overhead or using the cue position as a base. Taking a shot involves setting the exact pace and spin of it, and considering what each contact will do to the position of the cue ball, and any balls you may wish to pot afterwards. In the snooker mode playing accurate &apos;safety&apos; shots (to prevent your opponent scoring) becomes important as well). In each mode there are 10 computer opponents, and matches can consist of up to 9 frames. A trick-shot editor is also included, allowing you to practice shots and set up challenges. Replays and an undo mode are also included. Bonus games are included as well - darts, draughts, a fruit machine, and even a remake of Dropzone, a Commodore 64 game from the same programmer.</story>

He can perform moves such as 360-degree spin jumps, and hover jumps among others, while using his bazooka guitar as a weapon. When powered up, it can emit a special sonic blast that fries anything within hearing range. As you make your way through the demonic levels such as Hotel Demonique, Hell&apos;s Kitchen, and Mr. Diablo&apos;s fiery Penthouse, you can acquire more weapons, power-ups and find secret passages that lead to bonus levels.

    <story>Trouble in Mega-City One- An unidentified perpetrator has taken hostages, including the mayor. Attempts to apprehend him have already lead to the loss of 17 Judges. He states that only one man is allowed to come near- Judge Dredd. There&apos;s obviously some history between them. It&apos;s time for the toughest lawman of them all to move in and dispense justice via his Lawgiver gun. Judge Dredd for the PlayStation is an &apos;on rails&apos; lightgun shooter based on the original comics instead of the 1995 movie. The action moves through pre-rendered environments on a fixed path. 14 levels spread over 4 stages must be cleared of lawbreakers. Most enemies are polygonal 3D models overlaid over the video backdrop, but the background can also be shot at- gun turrets and some bosses like hovertanks and other heavy machinery are pre-rendered objects. Powerups are hidden in the scenery as well- there are different ammunition types for the Lawgiver, including rapid fire and heat-seekers. Also available are medikits, extra lives and rockets which can clear the screen of enemies. Not everything on the screen should be shot at, however- sometimes, innocent citizens will cross the scene. Hitting too many of them means a quick &apos;game over&apos;. The storyline of the game is told between levels via live-action cutscenes.</story>

    <story>Part of the popular Jump Start series, JumpStart Wildlife Safari- Field Trip is a learning activity game for PlayStation aimed at ages four and up. Intended to introduce and reinforce a number of skills including counting, alphabet, and shape recognition, the game uses the Jump Start&apos;s Early Discovery characters Kisha, Frankie, and Casey to accompany children through five different environments of learning activities. Also featured is JumpStart&apos;s Adjust-for-You learning technology, which recognizes individual progress and continually adjusts to keep the challenges from being too hard or too easy. Kisha and Frankie have been separated from Casey, and he is now lost on the safari grounds. Children help find him by playing as either Kisha or Frankie and completing all three levels of each environment. Difficulty increases with each level, and after one environment is successfully completed, players earn one letter toward spelling Casey&apos;s name. When completely spelled, Casey is found and will then become available as a character for selection. The Cat&apos;s Den, Goat Island, the Hatchery, Songbird Garden, and Polar Bear Mountain are the five areas for play. In the Cat&apos;s Den, children practice distinguishing similarities and differences as they return cubs to their respective mothers. On Polar Bear Mountain, children use color, pattern, and shape recognition as they ski down a flag-staked mountain choosing flags that match the color and shape of a specific flag pattern. Goat Island reinforces the alphabet as players rebuild log bridges, the Hatchery uses number recognition and counting through ten while children return eggs to mother ostriches, and Songbird Garden introduces music and pattern recognition. A game separate from the safari is also included in the Photo Booth and is accessible from the area selection screen. Here, children can play a memory game where matched cards disappear to reveal a hidden picture beneath. Bonus stars can be collected throughout each level, enabling more images to become available in the Photo Booth game. </story>

The game features a 1 player K-1 Kings mode, where the player picks a fighter and faces off against a series of computer controlled fighters, and another mode which is the 2 player K-1 Hercules mode. There is also the K-1 Grand Prix mode which has 16 fighters competing in a tournament to be the K-1 champion. The K-1 Challenge lets the player create a fighter. Players get to choose their fighters build type, skin color, color of their trunks, nationality, and a gym to train at which best reflects the fighting style they want. Players get to choose a trainer and 2 sub trainers to help condition them to become a fighting machine. To condition, the player selects a variety of exercises like jumping rope or using a medicine ball for their fighter to train in. Training builds up the fighters statistics and also earns them training points which can then be spent on moves such as uppercuts and hooks. Eventually after training for a while, the player will be challenged by a rival and they can choose to accept the challenge or decline if they feel they aren&apos;t ready yet and need more training. This mode takes the player&apos;s fighter through 8 years of his career trying to become a K-1 champion. Training mode lets the player practice their moves with a sparring partner.

    <story>K-1 Grand Prix is a kickboxing game featuring 32 real K-1 fighters. The game features a 1 player K-1 Kings mode, where the player picks a fighter and faces off against a series of computer controlled fighters, and another mode which is the 2 player K-1 Hercules mode. There is also the K-1 Grand Prix mode which has 16 fighters competing in a tournament to be the K-1 champion. The K-1 Challenge lets the player create a fighter. Players get to choose their fighters build type, skin color, color of their trunks, nationality, and a gym to train at which best reflects the fighting style they want. Players get to choose a trainer and 2 sub trainers to help condition them to become a fighting machine. To condition, the player selects a variety of exercises like jumping rope or using a medicine ball for their fighter to train in. Training builds up the fighters statistics and also earns them training points which can then be spent on moves such as uppercuts and hooks. Eventually after training for a while, the player will be challenged by a rival and they can choose to accept the challenge or decline if they feel they aren&apos;t ready yet and need more training. This mode takes the player&apos;s fighter through 8 years of his career trying to become a K-1 champion. Training mode lets the player practice their moves with a sparring partner. Finally, the Ring Side mode lets the player observe a match between 2 computer controlled fighters.

The game contains a one player mode, a versus mode, a tournament mode, a team battle mode, and a training mode. The one player mode has the player fight against several computer fighters, while the versus mode lets the player fight another player.

The score is derived from how well each fighter performed throughout the entire fight. Players have to pay attention to three different meters while fighting. A life gauge for that measures physical strength; a stamina gauge that decreases as each fighter uses a move; and a knockdown gauge to show the amount of damage each fighter has received.</story>

    <story>K-1 The Arena Fighters is a kickboxing game featuring 8 real world K-1 fighters. The game features a 1 player mode, a 2 player VS. mode, a Tournament mode featuring all 8 fighters, and a Team Battle mode. The team battle has 2 teams made up of 3 fighters each facing off against each other in one on one fights. The first team to win 2 out of 3 matches wins the entire team battle. Gameplay consists of two fighters in a boxing ring using high and low punches and kicks to down their opponent. Each fighter can also use their special signature move to hurt their opponent. Each fighter has two meters, one for strength and one for stamina. So the more punches and kicks that are thrown, the less amount of power they start to pack. This means the player is rewarded for timing their attacks because their attacks will be more effective. Also, a well placed hit on their opponent can lead to a flash knock down, which instantly drops the opponent to the canvas.</story>

    <story>Seven infamous monsters from Frankenstein to the Minotaur go head to head in this early PlayStation fighting game. These initial seven monsters are all there is; there are no hidden characters to unlock or a final boss to beat. Most of the characters are slow and un-manoeuvrable. This may be by design to represent the weight of the monsters; most of them are big and their fighting styles could be considered anything but skill based. For instance the Skeleton can jump on the opponent and stab them in the neck repeatedly with its sword while the Minotaur gores them with its horns. It must be said that the attacks in the game generally fit their respective monster. There are only two game modes available with the main one being the standard Normal Mode where one player goes up against the six other monsters and finally a mirror match. A second player can join in at any point (in fact it&apos;s the only way a second player can play as there is no Vs mode). If one completes this mode they are presented with a breakdown of their performance in each fight, though no ending in the real sense, as the game has no story at tall to explain why these monsters are fighting each other. The second game mode is an innovative mode the game calls Auto Mode and devotes most of its manual to. In this mode the player functions as a side line trainer to train and guide an AI controlled monster (selectable from one of the same seven as the Normal Mode) through several tournaments. This is done by pressing various buttons on the controller to tell your monster to try to perform certain offensive or defensive plays. The monster you are training start&apos;s of with little more than the ability to throw a punch and is slow to respond to your prompts, but will gain additional attacks and respond quicker and more intelligently to your prompts the more it fights, until it ultimately gains the full range of attacks it would have in the Normal Mode. However the full potential of this mode is undermined by the games lack of any save feature.</story>

When the dream comes true, Klonoa and his friend Huepow go to investigate. You take control of Klonoa as he travels through 12 levels of action. Klonoa will encounter a number of enemies who want to stop him. Fortunately, Klona can grab enemies and use them as weapons to destroy other bad guys, or throw them to the ground and propel himself upward. Besides grabbing enemies, Klonoa can also pump up larger enemies and make them explode. Help Klonoa discover the reason for the dream.</story>

    <story>Ten of Konami&apos;s classic arcade games, originally released from 1981-1985, make their their Playstation debut in this compilation- Pooyan - As your fellow pigs lower and raise you in an elevator for the perfect shot, you must defend them against the wolves. Shoot their balloons with arrows or make a bunch of them lose their grip by hitting them with meat. Time too many shots poorly and the wolves will inch their way up the tree towards you and the other pigs. The higher they get, the higher of an area you&apos;re restricted to for aiming. Circus Charlie - Six games of timing, reflex and patience in one, each more difficult than the last. Jump a lion through hoops and over flaming urns. Hurdle over monkeys on a tight rope. Bounce from trampoline to trampoline. Roll and leap from ball to ball. Avoid being knocked off your horse by jumping over or bouncing off of springboards. And at the most challenging level, fly from trapeze to trapeze. Shao-Lin&apos;s Road - Leap from level to level, kicking henchmen and their tougher bosses. Collect powerups like the roatating energy ball and the spiked ball. Roc &apos;N Rope - Cavemen and lizards impede your climb to reach the elusive Phoenix. Your only tools are a rope and flashlight. Throw your rope, climb up, and avoid your enemies or blind them with your flashlight. Yie Ar Kung-Fu - One of the granddaddies of one-on-one fighters. Start with the giant Buchu, working your way up through the ranks against armed opponents using only your punches and kicks. Each angle combined with either punch or kick provides a different attack. Scramble - Fly your rocket through enemy territory, avoiding enemy missiles or taking them down with your blasters or bombs. If you run out of fuel, you&apos;re history, so remember to shoot the fuel tanks to refuel. Road Fighter - A high-speed top-down racer. Pass other racers to increase your score. Crashing results in fuel penalties. Run into the multi-colored fuel cars or run the risk of running out of gas. Super Cobra - The speedy sequel to Scramble. Pilot your helicopter through similar territory, once again taking out rockets and fuel tanks. But now, you&apos;ll have to contend with turrets and other new enemies. Gyruss - Wave-based shmup in which you move your ship around the screen in a 360 degree loop. Avoid the swooping enemies and their shots. Grabbing the double shot increases your chances of survival. Time Pilot Pilot your craft in every direction through borderless levels spread across time. Biplanes, blimps, and more will try to take you out before you can eliminate them. Catch parachuters for bonus points. Each game, originally mated with a vertical monitor in the arcade, has been shrunk to fit the horizontal display common to most homes. Accomodating for the smaller playfield size, scores, lives and power meters for most games have been moved to the previously empty space on the righthand side. Added features include the following- Saving - Retain all of your high scores. Difficulty and Life Counts - Adjust them to your liking. DualShock Compatibility - Use the analog stick and/or add vibration feedback to games. Histories - Simple history pages featuring release dates, screenshots and trivia. Pre-game Instructions and Tips - Don&apos;t know how to play? As the game loads, you are presented with a simple instruction set, similar to what would have been on the original machine. Hit left or right at that screen for more detailed gameplay tips.</story>

    <story>In the early 21st century, the Earth is under attack by aliens. In five areas of the planet, they have erected energy generators, creating a field that slowly encompasses the entire planet surface. They have also taken hundreds of humans prisoner. Someone has to stop them. Enter Russian Commander Ivan Popovich, nicknamed Krazy Ivan. He is a paranoid schizophrenic, prone to burst out into violence at any time. In other words, he&apos;s perfect for the job. The player controls Ivan&apos;s Steel Cossack power suit on the three-dimensional battlefields. In each of the five areas in the game, two kinds of enemies can be found- Drones and Sentients. Drones are smaller air and ground vehicles that often respawn. Sentients are mechs similar in size and capability to the Steel Cossack. Each of the Sentients must be eliminated before the energy field generator can be destroyed to complete the mission. The Cossack is capable of carrying lots of weapons- projectile and energy guns, unguided and guided missiles, and other special weapons. Destroyed enemies reveal captured humans, to be rescued by Ivan, and power-ups, which recharge shields or rearm weapons. After a successful mission, Ivan can upgrade the Cossack with more powerful weapons and replace the mech&apos;s armor. Between the missions, rather humorous live-action cutscenes (starring English actors sporting thick Russian accents) continue the story.</story>

    <story>1500 years after Blood Omen- Legacy of Kain, the vampire Kain&apos;s decision at the end of that game has finally defeated the human kingdoms and brought the world of Nosgoth under his control. Ruling from a castle built on the Pillars of Nosgoth, Kain has established an empire of six vampire clans, each ruled by a lieutenant, the sons of Kain. Raziel was one such lieutenant, but lost his position through the insolence of receiving a new evolutionary dark gift, the growth of feathery wings, before his master had acquired it. Fearing that Raziel might one day surpass him, Kain tears off Raziel&apos;s wings in a fit of range and banishes him into the Abyss. There, Raziel is lost in time, died and his body consumed. The Elder God recovers Raziel&apos;s soul and rebuilds the broken body, not as a living vampire, but as a strange new creature of the underworld. Swearing revenge on Kain, Raziel now phases seamlessly between Nosgoth and it&apos;s underworld, using his new powers to become a terrible reaver of souls... Soul Reaver is a 3rd person action-adventure title that follows Raziel on his quest to purge the land of vampires and take revenge on Kain and his brothers, leaders of the six clans. The player controls the game from behind Raziel&apos;s shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel&apos;s can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. Raziel can shift through the material world into the spectral realm at will... but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel&apos;s life energy at a constant rate. Throughout the game, energy is recovered by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. If Raziel is able to defeat one of his brothers, he will additionally gain a new ability (dark gift) upon drinking it&apos;s soul. Examples include- the ability to swim, file telekinetic projectiles or the ability to phase through locked gates. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of weapons including spears, daggers, swords, axes, as well as attacking enemies barehanded. Eventually, Raziel will also come across Kain&apos;s personal sword (named the Soul Reaver), and will use it to create a powerful energy blade weapon. The world is left open to Raziel, he can return to areas previously completed and explore the world of Nosgoth at will. Access to certain areas however sometimes requires the use of gained specific abilities. Many of the puzzles the player will need to solve in this quest are block puzzles, requiring the placement of certain large structures (usually square blocks), either to activate switches or to build access to out-of-reach areas.</story>

    <story>Legend is the sequel to it&apos;s namesake for the SNES. Despite the conversion to 3D, the game still keeps all the action in a two dimensional plane. The Kingdom of Tovakia is overtaken by chaos and despair. After several assassination attempts, the king&apos;s brother is sent into exile. During his exile, however, he learns the dark arts of sorcery. He summons a demon to support him in his quest to rule over Tovakia. When he manages to kidnap the king, it is up to the protagonists to save him, and Tovakia, from the evil brother. You can choose to play one of three characters- Axel (all-round character), Tara (fast and good with light weapons) and Karo (slow but strong and good with heavy weapons). You will find a wide array of weapons and enemies in this 3D Beat &apos;em Up. Besides the standard medieval weaponry there are various ranged spells you can use to hurt the enemy. There are five stages to play through and each stage ends with a level boss. In multiplayer it is possible to play the game in two player co-op with increased difficulty.</story>

    <story>Legend of Legaia is a console RPG who&apos;s main innovation is its complex and unusual battle system. Your initial party consists of three characters- Vahn, Noa, and Gala - two males and one female. You engage yourself on a quest of freeing your planet from a mysterious mist which is floating above the planet and which can turn anything it touches into a dreadful monster. In order to clean the planet from the horrible mist, you have to find so-called Genesis Trees which are scattered around on the planet. The combat system, which is probably the most original part of this game, isn&apos;t quite similar to the well-known menu-based Final Fantasy style. If you are familiar with the combat system of Xenogears, it&apos;s more similar to this one, but more complicated. Your choices aren&apos;t just attack, defend or use special abilities- the attack option itself has many choices- high-attack, low-attack, kick etc., a bit like in Revenant. Apart from this system, the game is a typical Asian console 3D RPG with manga characters, map-exploring, etc.</story>

    <story>A twinkling consciousness became a star that sparkled in the night and banished the darkness. The Mana Goddess acquired consciousness by gazing into the light of that sun. She made Fa´Diel, a great land, but so far an empty one. In Legend of Mana you control a hero or heroine traveling over the land of Fa’Diel. The game features a land creation system, allowing you to create new locations and story elements by placing mysterious artifacts. Those ancient artifacts are repositories of the land´s long-forgotten memories and the many events that once took place there. As the game advances, you will receive more artifacts and find out more about the land. At home you can raise pet monsters and create powerful golems, forge mighty weapons or refine musical instruments. On your adventures you can meet various interesting characters and fight against gruesome monsters. The game is extremely non-linear in terms of gameplay. You can explore areas in any order and play through 67 related scenarios. Eventually you will resurrect the Mana Tree and discover the Legend of Mana.</story>

Unlike the first game you can now pick the player yourself, instead of being assigned one, which allows you to make some unconventional choices, such as playing a goal keeper. You play the game from a third person perspective. You can perform typical moves for soccer games, and also have the option to give commands to your teammates, to pass, shoot or intercept. After each match you are presented with statistical graphs and you are graded for your play. Game modes include friendly matches, two tourneys and a league.

    <story>Somewhere in the universe, there is a beautiful planet called Twinsun. It is populated by four different races, which have been living in peace and prosperity, until a mad scientist Dr. Funfrock of the Quetch (human-like) race used his newly invented cloning and teleporting techniques to create an army of fearsome soldiers and become the planet&apos;s dictator. Twinsun&apos;s inhabitants have not lost hope, placing their faith in the old legend about the benevolent goddess Sendell who would save the world. However, Dr. Funfrock totalitarian regime forbade displaying any images of the goddess and her worship. A young Quetch named Twinsen was just a regular fellow until he had a dream, which surprisingly involved the outlawed goddess. It seems that Dr. Funfrock was no stranger to mind control; in his opinion, even dreaming of the goddess was illegal, and he promptly ordered to put the perpetrator in prison. Now the unlikely hero must find a way to escape and eventually save his planet from the clutches of its insane ruler. Little Big Adventure (Relentless- Twinsen&apos;s Adventure in the US) is primarily an adventure game with strong action elements. As usually in adventure games, the hero must talk to other characters, and collect and use objects. However, not all the problems have to be solved with dialogue and item manipulation. The player can activate four different behavior modes for Twinsen- Normal, Aggressive, Athletic, and Discreet. The first is used for peaceful exploration and conversations; Aggressive mode allows Twinsen to punch and kick other characters; Athletic mode must be applied when it becomes necessary to run quickly and jump; Discreet effectively puts Twinsen in a stealth mode, making it possible to sneak by hostile character unnoticed. While activation of a particular mode is often required to solve a problem, many situations can be dealt with in different ways. The game universe is rendered with characters in full 3D, while the environment uses isometric graphic tiles. The CD version (which was released earlier than the floppy one) features pre-rendered animated cutscenes, audio music and speech; all these features are absent from the floppy disk version.</story>

    <story>Unlike other console football management games at the time which were ports of existing PC titles, LMA Manager was designed exclusively for the PlayStation. The game is notable for its intuitive control system, where the L1 and R1 shoulder buttons of the controller switch between different sections of the game (e.g. from the Transfers section to the Squad section), and L2 and R2 switch between sub-screens within a section (e.g. from the Select Team screen to Editing Tactics). As a full management sim, players can start an open-ended game, or face one of the ten challenges. The data is based on the 1999/2000 season player and team statistics. The kits and teams are authentic, with 8,000 players and 294 clubs in 32 countries. As a manager, you control the club finances, take care of coaching, stadium development and player management. During the matches, shown in 3D, managers can make tactical changes and substitutions at any time. There is also an after-match TV show with results, highlights and commentary.</story>

    <story>LMA Manager 2001 is the second game in the LMA Manager series of football management games. The main game involves a 15 year career managing an English Football team (Premier, 1st, 2nd or 3rd division). There are also 14 shorter challenges ranging from winning the treble with 3 games left to winning 3 successive promotions from division 3 to the Premier in 3 seasons. The player is responsible for selecting the team line-up and tactics, buying and selling players on the European transfer market, selecting training schedules and managing the club&apos;s finances. Unlike other console football management games of the time which were ports of existing PC titles, the LMA Manager titles were designed exclusively for the PlayStation.

The graphics of the first game, which had a rather retro look, have been improved to a more modern clean-looking design. The game provides a mini 3D match where the manager can make tactical changes during gameplay and 3D highlights afterwards commented by Alan Hansen (former Liverpool player turned BBC commenter). International versions were sold under different localized titles- BDFL Manager in Germany (Bund Deutscher Fußball-Lehrer, basically the German equivalent of the LMA), Manager de Liga in Spain, Football Manager Campionato in Italy, and Roger Lemerre - La Sélection des Champions in France. Only teams from the home country could be managed although all 294 teams were included in each game for use in the transfer market and European cup competitions.</story>

    <story>Lode Runner for the PlayStation is two games on one disc. First, there is Lode Runner- The Legend Returns, a graphically enhanced remake of the computer classic. Secondly, there is Lode Runner Extra, a sequel of sorts that continues where the former game left off. In The Legend Returns, the once green and fertile Earth is now a cesspool of filth, made this way by centuries of pollution. What remains of humanity resides deep within caverns, searching for gold, a substance still considered valuable. With enough gold, a person can buy safe passage from the planet. Chief among these Lode Runners is Jake Peril, a man who spends most of his time climbing ladders and ropes, walking across platforms, falling off platforms, digging holes and, of course, scooping up piles of gold. As you guide Jake around the underworld, grabbing all the gold so you can progress to the next level, a subterranean cult of gold worshippers will follow you around and make your task difficult. You can dig holes to momentarily trap these Mad Monks, but you should be careful not to trap yourself or touch a monk. As you go from level to level, the gold will be harder and harder to gather as you are basically forced to figure out puzzles that will enable you to dig your way to, fall on, or otherwise come in contact with the gold. Lode Runner Extra is similar to The Legend Returns, but with the addition of bombs, goo, teleporters and other tools for use in outwitting the Mad Monks and rival Lode Runners. In this game, the monks have abducted Jake (right after he found enough gold to escape the planet) and banished him to their deepest, deadliest caverns. Once again, Jake must gather enough treasure to escape the planet. The two games combined have more than 300 levels. In addition, there is a special Construction Mode that lets you place ladders, keys, guards, exits, hideouts, doors, patches of ground (platforms), holes, gold bars, skulls, and other items wherever you wish. Ten different backgrounds and 10 types of music are available. </story>

    <story>London Racer II is another iteration in the prolific Racer series by Davilex. The races take place primarily in the streets of London and Edinburgh, with additional tracks in Las Vegas, New York and Chicago. There are three single player modes available- Single Race, Tournament and Time Trial. In Single Race the player is free to choose any of the 6 characters available, any of the tracks and any of the unlocked cars. In Tournament mode, the player races in a series of tracks while collecting money prizes and unlocking new cars. In both modes, players race against other races while avoiding being catch by the police. The Time Trial mode, players race against the clock trying to beat the best time for each track. Each car (driven by a different character) has different stats in acceleration, top speed, handling, breaking and strength. The cars can also be upgraded using money collected from winning races and collecting money tokens during races. The cars also take damage when hit and can break into total loss if the damage bar is full. Repair tokens can be collected during races and if a car finishes a race damaged it can be repaired before the next one using money. Nitro tokens can also be collected and bought, and the cars&apos; colors can be changed. There are also two split-screen two player modes- Duel and Cop vs. Driver. In the Duel mode, players race against each other in any given track. In Cop vs. Driver, one player is the cop and the other a regular racer, and the cop player must try to crash the driver within the time limit. The game can be played from either first (hood camera) or third person (behind the car) perspective.</story>

    <story>Looney Tunes Racing is a kart-racing game for the PlayStation. There are some definite similarities between this title and Crash Team Racing, both in game play mechanics and depth. Completely immersed in the humor and soul of the Looney Tunes license, the player starts the game with only a handful of characters and levels available, but as the game proceeds features become unlocked including new characters, levels, and challenges. Each character has an unique vehicle themed just for them, and is accompanied by voice taunts, provided by Warner Bros. licensed voice actors, and character-specific animations that help bring these characters to life. The weapons the player can unleash onto the opponents include cherry bombs, homing cream pies, thunder clouds with devastating lightning bolts, and giant anvils that drop out of the sky. In addition, each uniquely themed level has a series of amusing booby traps and obstacles that the player can unleash to slow down your foes. The player can make boulders fall, launch giant boxing gloves on springs, and trample the opponents with sheep in the red-rock canyons, get spacecraft to fire lasers in the Martian level, and activate a huge, fat, white horse in the Opera stage to come in and trounce on the enemies. Even Gossamer, the large monster make entirely of red hair (except for those big white eyes and white tennis shoes), makes a cameo in the Gossamer’s castle level, as he comes right out onto the track to take out any oncoming traffic. Beyond the races, other noteworthy game modes include the Multi-player Battle Mode, where the players basically pummel each other with wacky weaponry, and the ACME Challenges, which include challenges such as Boss Races (against Porky Pig, for example), picking up key items in a certain order, and others.</story>

You play as a young boy named Alex, who has been always dreaming to become a noble warrior, The Dragonmaster, just like his idol, the legendary Dragonmaster Dyne. Together with Nall, a talkative flying cat, and Luna, a lovely girl with a beautiful voice Alex loves very much, the young hero embarks on a journey- he must meet the four Dragons in order to become a Dragonmaster. But on the way he learns that the world is in danger, and Luna is going to be used in a mighty adversary&apos;s plan to bring back the goddess Althena. Past and present are closely connected, the destinies of great heroes are linked together, and Alex has to save Luna and the world with the help of his faithful friends and his love. The game plays like a traditional Japanese RPG- you have a party where each character belongs to a certain class and has his/her own special attacks. The enemies are not random, but visible on screen. The combat is turn-based and is viewed from a top-down perspective, like the rest of the game. You can position and move your characters on the battlefield. This remake brings a lot of changes to the original game. Large parts of the story were re-written, new scenes introduced, the gameplay system refined. The graphics were also re-made to high-resolution 2D. In addition, both Saturn and Playstation versions feature long and numerous animé-style full-motion cutscenes.</story>

    <story>In M&amp;M&apos;s - Shell Shocked , the 2 lead candies are about to set off on a vacation until the red candy realizes that the yellow candy left the M&amp;Ms Minis in charge of the candy factory. The Minis promptly steal the secret M&amp;Ms formulas and cause havoc at the factory. It is up to the yellow candy to set the situation right. The gameplay has been described as being similar to the Crash Bandicoot series. The action in the game takes place over 8 levels. The first 7 levels involve some kind of math skill (configurable at various skill levels to cover addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The first level depicts the yellow candy frantically driving back to the candy factory. Along the way are math formulas on the side of the road, followed closely by 3 crates on the road, each with a number. Striking the crate with the correct answer for the previous formula will allow passage, while the 2 wrong answers are steel crates that will end your vehicle. The same action is repeated in a later level involving a forklift. Another type of level has the yellow candy jumping from number platform to number platform according to the math formulas that a disembodied female voice calls out. Another type of level is a 3D running/jumping action level in which the yellow candy will run down a hallway while observing clues about math formulas along the way. At the end of the hallway will be 3 doors, each with a possible answer. Choose wisely. All along the way are M&amp;Ms candies to be collected in large quantities. Every 100 M&amp;Ms candies earns the player an extra life. The PlayStation version is basically the same game but minus the Math mode.</story>

The included teams have been updated for the 2004 NFL season and include the 32 regular teams, NFC and AFC all-star teams, more than 100 classic NFL teams, 31 all-time franchise teams and the 6 NFL Europe teams. The returning modes are Exhibition, Season, Franchise, Custom League, Tournament, Coaches Corner, Situation (including Great Games), and Two-Minute Drill.

    <story>Magic Carpet is a first-person perspective game, in which you are a mage who flies on a, well, magic carpet and casts spells. The game has 50 levels, called worlds; each of those is set in a sea terrain with several mountainous islands. Your goal on each level is to amass enough mana within your castle to restore the equilibrium within the world. Once this happens, you can head to the next level. To collect mana, you have to find it (it is represented by golden spheres) and cast a specific spell to make it yours. To collect this mana, you have to use a special spell to raise a castle of your own out of the ground. A balloon will appear over the newly created castle; it will proceed to fly around the level and collect your mana. Initially, your castle will be small and won&apos;t be able to hold much mana, so you&apos;ll have to keep casting the castle spell at it to make it bigger. The levels typically have monsters and rival mages in them. Not only they can hurt you with their attacks, but killing them is often necessary, as upon death they will release some of the mana you need to complete the level. To attack your enemies, you have a variety of spells at your disposal- fireballs, lightning bolts and meteors. There are also many other spells available to you - they allow you to heal yourself, surround yourself with a protective shield, teleport around, summon a skeleton army, or even modify the terrain by creating volcanoes and splitting landmasses. Not all spells are available to you from the beginning, though. Throughout all the levels, you are on your flying carpet, which can move in 3 dimensions. You can bring up a top-down map at any time.</story>

    <story>Magical Tetris Challenge is a Tetris game that combines the classic puzzler with the Disney license, and offers two original competitive Tetris variants- Magical Tetris and Updown Tetris. Both follow the standard Tetris template- Tetris pieces fall onto the playing field from the top and must be arranged so they form horizontal lines which are then removed, with the player whose stack of pieces reaches the top first losing. In Magical Tetris, clearing two or more lines at the same time sends a magical attack to the opponent, which puts a non-standard magical piece into their queue. Magical pieces consists of more than four blocks and are thus harder to place, but can theoretically clear more lines at once. Magical attacks can be countered by clearing lines while the piece is in the queue. This sends the piece back to the opponent, changing it to a 2x2 square piece. Countered pieces can again be countered, growing in size with each counter to a maximum of 5x5. Overflow to an already full queue turns existing pieces into ones marked with an exclamation mark. These can&apos;t be countered and are massive in size and come in pyramid or diamond shapes. A clock counts the time during Magical Tetris - each minute of game time raises the game level, up to a maximum of 4, with higher levels resulting in more magical pieces added to the opponent&apos;s queue per cleared line. Updown Tetris is less complex. Attacks against the opponent are made by clearing two or more lines, which are then (minus one column) added to the bottom of the opponent&apos;s playing field, pushing their stack higher. Both modes include another gameplay element- the magical gauge is filled by clearing single lines or through attacks made by the opponent. Filling the meter clears the entire playing field above a certain threshold and simplifies the block structure below it. The meter is then cleared and the threshold rises, requiring more moves to fill it a second time. The threshold can only be lowered by clearing all blocks off the field. The two modes are available in story and two-player modes. In story mode, players select one of four Disney characters (Mickey, Donald, Goofy and Minnie) who each come with their own storylines. The game then consists of consecutive matches against the other characters and the bad guys (Pete, Big Bad Wolf and Weasel), with cutscenes between matches. Only the home versions have an endless mode, which offers standard Tetris and Magical Tetris.</story>

Three spheres of the same color side by side will disappear and give you points; all other same spheres in vertical or horizontal neighborhood to this three will also vanish (combos)! The clue are the scales because of imbalance they go up or down and can catapult the spheres over the whole area! And there can be highest only eight spheres on one scale pan - otherwise game over. Later in a game there will be more and more colors and special items.

After a discovery there comes one last garbled message—danger, danger cliché approaching--“have opened Pandora’s box… all the evils of old Mars have flown out,” and a warning, “…if you do send a manned mission, warn the crew…Stay Alone, Stay Alive…” then nothing. So now it’s 2018, and your rescue mission to Mars crash lands. When you get to the base, the welcome wagon is made up of zombies and an alien virus that will make you look back fondly on the days of the Black Plague. You control a team of three- Kenzo, Karne and Matlock. They enter the base from different airlocks and try to discover what happened. The reason for the whole Stay alone, stay alive warning is that if your team members come together they end up forming into a disgusting mass of flesh -- picture the thing from Leviathan -- called a Trimorph. As you proceed though the base you find clues as to what occurred. In addition, you run into Trimorphs, some of the non zombiefied former base crew, that are bent on your destruction. They come in two sizes -- the small spidery kind which hack at your shins and jump on your face or the huge better run like hell monstrosities that will tear you to pieces.</story>

The gameplay is very similar to X-Men- Children of the Atom, but with a simplified Super Combo gauge and the addition of infinity gems. Each character starts with a set of gems. These can be activated during a fight to improve speed, power and defence, or provide special abilities to create crushing stone walls, open up a rift in space, or reverse the opponent&apos;s controls. The use of the gems is inspired by the The Infinity Gauntlet comic book series. There are ten playable characters. The heroes are Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Psylocke, Spider-Man and Wolverine. The villains are Blackheart, Juggernaut, Magneto and Shuma-Gorath. Anita from the Darkstalkers series is a hidden character in the Japanese version. The bosses are Doctor Doom and Thanos. During the boss fight Thanos steals all the player&apos;s gems (except for mind) and uses them with new effects.</story>

It is also the first in Capcom&apos;s games to introduce a tag team style of combat where the player can call for another character during a fight. Matches consists of two-on-two battles where the player can only control one character at a time. The other character can be called in regularly or while doing an attack. The off-screen one also regains some health while waiting. Both opposing characters need to be defeated to win the match, and when one dies the other is called in automatically. The tag team options introduces Variable Attack, Variable Counter and Variable Combination where the two characters team up to attack, counter of perform a special move. Most of the X-Men characters were already present in X-Men- Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes- Cyclops, Storm, Juggernaut, Magneto and Wolverine, with the addition of Rogue, Gambit and Sabretooth. The Street Fighter characters are gathered from Street Fighter Alpha 2- Ryu, Ken, Cammy/Chun-Li, Charlie, Zangief, Dhalsim, M. Bison and Akuma. The final boss of the game is Apocalypse. The PlayStation version does not include the tag team feature and relies on the more traditional best-two-of-three round setup.</story>

The other characters can be summoned for assist attacks and there is also a duo team attack to control two characters for a brief time, along with the ability to perform super moves where the characters team up. Options include a straight arcade battle, 4-player tag modes (Dreamcast version only), a survival mode (much like Street Fighter Alpha 3) and a training mode. The PlayStation version does not have the 4-player tag mode and also reduces the second character to an assist role, but in addition introduces a crossover mode where tag-team play with identical teams is possible. For Marvel the cast of playable characters includes Spider Man, Captain America, Venom, Hulk, Gambit, War Machine, Wolverine, Gold War Machine (secret character), Hyper Venom (secret character), Orange Hulk (secret character) and Onslaught (secret character). The Capcom side offers Chun-Li, Ryu, Zangief, Morrigan Aensland, Captain Commando, Megaman (Rockman in Asia), Strider Hiryu, Jin Saotome, Roll (secret character), Lilith-Mode Morrigan (secret character) and Shadow Lady (secret character). There is also a large number of special partners that can be summoned.</story>

If a player gets shot by a bad guy, they will loose a bar of health or can also loose health by accidentally shooting innocent bystanders. There are also power-ups scattered throughout the stage that can restore health, upgrade their weapons power among many others.

    <story>You are the genetically engineered Clan Mechwarrior. The Clans are invading the Inner Sphere. Join either the Wolf Clan or the Jade Falcon Clan as they pursue their own agenda against the Inner Sphere and other Clans. Take your advanced Omnimechs into battle against all comers. Win high warrior ratings (by using less mechs or smaller mechs than needed, completing secondary objectives, etc.) and you&apos;ll get chance at a promotion trial where you face superior odds in an arena. If you win, you advance in rank. If you are very successfully, you can make it all the way up to Khan, leader of the Clan! Mechwarrior II was developed in-house by Activision as the successor to their original Mechwarrior. While this time there are no dynamic campaign and mercenary actions, the Clan culture is integrated into the two campaigns. Different clans have different mechs and different rules, even different weapons. You can customize your mechs in order to use less than the par force in order to get a higher rating. The full 3D environment wasn&apos;t pretty as this was before the 3D accelerators made their debut, but it&apos;s still better than anything that came before. Let addition of NetMech allowed users to fight each other online. When 3D cards came along, special versions were created to take advantage of 3D texturing. While not QUITE as replayable as Mechwarrior, it&apos;s nonetheless a classic. If you want them now, get the Titanium Edition, which is 3D accelerated.</story>

    <story>In a world covered almost entirely in water, there exist small islands that hide huge treasures. And where there&apos;s treasure, you can find treasure hunters called Diggers, who live for the thrill of the hunt... Barrel Casket was once one of the greatest Diggers, but he has now retired. He now cares for his young granddaughter, Roll, whose parents disappeared while on a dig. He had also discovered a strange baby boy in some ruins one time, who he also took under his care alongside Roll. He named the baby boy Rock Voulnut, and Rock grew up to be an expert Digger, sometimes known by his nickname, MegaMan. While out exploring one day, Rock, Roll, and Barrel&apos;s airship, the Flutter, crash lands on an island named Kattelox. As they explore Kattelox in hopes of fixing their ship, they hear word of a huge treasure, the legendary Mother Lode, that is buried somewhere on the island. Rock, Roll, and Barrel decide to look for the treasure, but at the same time, they&apos;re going to get a little competition from a pirate family named the Bonnes... Mega Man Legends is the first of the Mega Man series to take place in fully explorable 3D, and is paced more like an RPG than the previous stage-to-stage action games. Rock can explore the town and follow the story to find entrances to the underground ruins, where in he will find traps, feral Reaverbots, and large boss robots. Destroying enemies will reward Rock with health, sub-weapon energy, and the power cores of the robots, which people in his world use as currency. By searching through the town and ruins Rock will find items of dubious use and value, and they can be brought back to Roll to be assembled into useful items and upgradable sub-weapons, although not for free. Rock can run while shooting, go into first person mode for aimed shots, and also lock onto an enemy and circle around them to avoid their attacks.</story>

    <story>Metal Gear Solid is a sequel to Metal Gear 2- Solid Snake. After the tragic confrontation with Big Boss, the hero, special agent Solid Snake, decided to retire and has since then lived in a secluded region in Alaska. But the US government recruits him once again for a dangerous mission. The members of Foxhound, a renegade special forces unit, threaten to use a devastating nuclear weapon if the government doesn&apos;t hand them the mortal remains of Big Boss, their former commander. Foxhound is now led by a talented, ambitious young man with the codename Liquid Snake. Knowing that the visual resemblance between this new terrorist mastermind and himself can not be coincidental, Solid Snake agrees to infiltrate the new Foxhound base, to destroy the unknown nuclear weapon, and to find the truth about his own identity. The gameplay in Metal Gear Solid follows the prototype established in the two classic Metal Gear games. Solid Snake has a limited arsenal of weapons and cannot allow himself to pave his way to the goal by killing all the enemies. He has to stay unnoticed, to hide, to crawl, to wait for the right moment, to sneak, and to use various gadgets that will prevent him from alerting the enemy. The game utilizes traditional top-down view, but the graphics in this installment are real-time 3D.</story>

Having just finished getting their airship, the Gesellschaft, operational, Teisel Bonne sets out with younger brother Bon Bonne to explore an unexplored ruin. Unfortunately for Teisel the loan he took out to pay for the Gesellschaft just came due, and the two Bonne brothers are taken prisoner. Now it&apos;s up to Tron to save her siblings and pay off their debt the only way she knows how- Grand Larceny. Most of the levels in The Misadventures of Tron Bonne are played similarly to Mega Man Legends, but with minor tweaks to controls. Tron&apos;s walking tank, the Gustaff, can&apos;t equip the wide range of alternate weapons like Mega Man, but it can pick up and hurl large objects like trees and cars. It can also launch beacon bombs which direct the Servbots following Tron to either attack or steal anything in the vicinity. Additional levels include a crate stacking puzzle minigame where Tron needs to steal selected crates of valuables in a limited number of moves, and a first person dungeon exploration section where Tron must depend on the Servbots alone to clear out traps and enemies. Despite the Servbots all looking alike, each one has unique stats and abilities. By taking them on missions, training them aboard the Gesellschaft, or using special items their stats can be raised, unlocking hidden talents.</story>

Another feature the game has is Manager mode which lets the player check out scouting reports during the game, warm up relievers in the bullpen, and try to get their team to the World Series and hopefully win it. A unique feature of this game is the Total Control Fielding and Total Control Batting systems. The batting system effects how much control the player has on how the ball is hit, which direction it gets hit to, and the power of the batter&apos;s swing.The fielding system lets the player have more control over the fielders. There is also an Advanced Batting Cursor option where guessing the pitcher&apos;s pitch correctly let&apos;s the player lock on to the pitch for more power while guessing incorrectly will make the batting cursor shrink and make the ball harder to hit The Artificial Intelligence used in the game was developed with consultation from Tony Gwynn, Trevor Hoffman and Davey Johnson.

    <story>The only baseball game released for the PlayStation in 2002, MLB 2003 continues Sony&apos;s seven-year franchise with updated teams, schedules, and rosters to reflect the beginning of the 2002 season. Eight modes of play include Quick Start, Exhibition, All-Star Game, Season, Playoffs, World Series, Spring Training, and Home Run Derby. The Season mode supports one or two players and offers both a Franchise and Manager option to further customize the action. Instead of spanning multiple seasons in length, the Franchise mode in MLB 2003 involves earning points as a weakened club to acquire new, higher quality players. There are no trades in this mode, only additions and cuts. Each win and offensive statistic in the categories of home runs, triples, doubles, and stolen bases earns players points, while losing games deducts points from a player&apos;s talent pool. Manager mode has the computer playing the games based on decisions made in starting lineups, pitching, and fielding positions. MLB 2003 also features a number of General Manager options, including trades, signing free agents, the ability to call up seven prospects from the farm system, and monitoring the disabled list. Players can also conduct a 25-round draft with adjustable salary cap limits, create up to 24 athletes, and shuffle the teams around the divisions by rearranging them manually or having them randomly reassigned. The cursor-based batting and pitching interface is identical to previous games in the series, and broadcasters Vin Scully and Dave Campbell once again handle the commentary. </story>

Players can also create and save their own players and customize them to their liking as well as keep extensive track of stats. They also have the option to run a franchise at the same time and manage everything including trades and free agency. The controls consist of using certain buttons to either run the bases, bat and throw specific pitches depending upon the pitcher and the D-pad to move outfielders. Also, to throw to bases the player uses the main buttons (Triangle, Square, Circle and X).</story>

It also contains quick play, season and home run derby as well as the option to play playoff games or to go straight to the World Series. As a fully licensed game, it contains the real uniforms, logo and players and statistics based on the actual characteristics. Despite being released late in 1996 however, when the baseball season was already over, all the information still refers to the 1995 season. Commentary is done by Jerry Coleman. Players can create their own players or compose a dream team from the pool of available players.</story>

This is a very realistic and highly detailed simulation which accurately recreates the Mobil 1 British Rally Championship. 36 tracks are available, all of which have been created by mapping the real life locations to create a highly accurate racing experience. There are also 22 rally cars to race in which have also been created from their real life counterparts. Although the name of the game is Mobil 1 British Rally Championship, it simply says Rally Championship on the front of the box and the game manual. Ignoring this little problem this game is an excellent addition to Europress&apos; rally series and possibly the most realistic racing game ever.</story>

    <story>Gunbird is a vertically scrolling shoot &apos;em up developed by Psikyo. It hit the Japanese arcade in 1994 and was followed by a Japanese release to the Saturn and the Playstation in the following year. The game is set in a fantasy setting with steampunk elements. Lush forests and medieval castles meet steam trains and mech robots. Instead of piloting the genre-traditional space ships, Gunbird lets the player chose between five different characters (Ash, Marion, Valnus, Yuan Nang and Tetsu) who traverse the game world on broomstick, jet packs and pedal-powered helicopters on a quest to find the pieces of a magic mirror across seven stages. Unorthodox vehicles aside, the gameplay follows traditional genre standards. The main goal is to dodge all bullets that fill the screen while collecting power-ups to make the character stronger. Gunbird features one power-up that incrementally increases the firepower of the standard weapon (P-items) as well as additional ammo for the screen-clearing special ability (B-items). Standard weapon and special ability differ from character to character. Where some characters excel in high firepower in a straight line others allow for a wider spread of bullets or additional homing missiles.</story>

    <story>Monkey Magic is a platform game for the Playstation based upon a successful cartoon of the same name. The cartoon (and thus, the game) is based upon Journey to the West - classic of eastern literature in which Monkey (renamed Kongo for Monkey Magic) defends his fellow simians, engages in adventures, and challenges the gods in heaven. Monkey is something of a trickster, much like Coyote in Native American folk tales. Kongo begins his journey with only his Kung-Fu to defend hiself, but soon he meets Master Subodeye, who teaches him the four elemental powers- Shrink, Grow, Fire, and Ice. Kongo learns to cast these spells on himself and on others for various effects. These magical powers form the basis for Monkey Magic&apos;s many puzzles. At the outset, Kongo is assisted by Batty. Batty explains the mechanics of the game should the player get stuck. After the first half of the game, Batty is revealed to be working for the evil Derth Voyd. But Kongo will put an end to his evil plans!</story>

    <story>Monster Rancher BattleCard Episode II is a sequel to the Monster Rancher Battle Card game on Game Boy. But it takes advantage of the PlayStation&apos;s superiority in graphics and processing power and adds more complex storyline quests, and expands the card game itself. No knowledge of other Monster Rancher games is needed, however, characters from prior games do play pivotal roles in the storyline. For the first time, players can see into the personal lives of the characters in the Monster Rancher world, and interact with them while attempting to win matches of the collectible card game, to collect enough cards to complete quests. Along the way, the player is able to visit various locales and meet up with old friends and new acquaintances. The card game itself features a tutorial mode, on screen help, and the option to turn animations on or off. It is easy enough at low levels for almost anyone to learn the basics, but offers options and higher levels of complexity to reward more patient, and older players. Cards are acquired through defeating opponents, and via an in-game shrine where you can use music CDs, PlayStation games, or PC CD-ROMs to make cards. The CD shrining feature is unique to the Monster Rancher games. The game also features a 2P mode designed for players who have played the game on their own and acquired their own cards (and tried and tested their skills) to play card games against each other. It is adequate, but unrelated to the in-game storyline.</story>

    <story>Not much of a fighter? Like to work with exotic animals? Like helping people? Then start gathering your seeds today! Monster Seed obviously takes influence from the popular animal raising/fighting genre; specifically games like Pokémon and Monster Rancher. Of course, it does do a few things differently. One major difference is the fantasy setting. No ranches or medical settings here, no sir. Another key difference is in the overall presentation; Monster Seed&apos;s gameplay and interface are a lot more simple than most other breeding games. Similar to mother games in the genre, there&apos;s a brief tutorial of sorts, and then you&apos;re off to gather your own creatures, earning better seeds and other breeding components as you go. Just be careful with your critters, because if they die in battle, they&apos;re gone for good. Granted you can always breed more, but it can certainly set you back if your creature hatches at level five, but you lost a level twelve. Combat itself uses a somewhat typical turn-based system, with a grid used to determine character locations, spell ranges and so on. Much like a normal RPG, you get to take turns giving commands to your main character and your monsters. Different monsters are better suited for different roles, with some better off hanging out in the back, attacking from a distance and others in the front lines, absorbing the damage and dishing out the hurt. Monster Seed isn&apos;t the most innovative RPG/breeding game out there, but it is a decent game that will help any fan of the genre pass the time.</story>

If they are far away, they give more points. After six shots the player has to reload the weapon (which gives a time penalty). The time is limited, the screen can be scrolled left and right and the ultimate goal is to improve the own highscore. In this game the only background is set at a sea. New features are more different animals to shoot, including the Lesshühner which give negative points. Two new ammo types are more powerful but limited and have to be earned by shooting certain things. There are multiple hidden extras to find, e.g. ways to extend the playing time. In the PC version there is an online highscore list.</story>

    <story>Moorhuhn (distributed as Crazy Chicken in English-speaking countries) is a German casual game franchise for PCs and the Nintendo DS. It consists of more than 30 games, the first of which - a shoot &apos;em up - was Germany&apos;s most popular computer game in the early 2000s. Originally the star of an promotional campaign for undrinkable whiskey Jack Daniels, Moorhunh has starred in over thirty games during the years, including five kart racing games. Moorhuhn 2 - Die Jagd Geht Weiter gameplay is like the first Moorhuhn game, the hunter in front of the screen must shoot down as many grouse as possible in 90 seconds. This generates points. That&apos;s it. Simple, but effective! Certain basic principles remain the same- 90 seconds, grouse flying around the landscape, shooting the above (the grouse, not the landscape!!!) yields points. That was enough for part one, but there had to be more in the sequel. So the game this time is filled with loads of hidden puzzles to solve in order to spur on the fans&apos; passion for the hunt. </story>

    <story>Moorhuhn returns with a complete redesign in 3D in this sequel to previous titles of the Moorhuhn shooter series. Instead of simply flying and running around, the chickens feature a lot of animated motion sequences that make them seem almost alive. The surroundings are completely generated in 3D and feature a lot of crazy objects and scenes such as two hedgehogs playing cards (one is actually wearing dark sunglasses!). The chickens try to hide in every conceivable place on screen, be it an old oven or in an outdoor toilet. They hide in wheat fields and even dress up as a sunflower in order to escape the player&apos;s dreadful gun. All these features make it more difficult for the player to get all the chickens. The actual shooting controls remain the same as in previous Moorhuhn games- the player aims with the mouse, shoots by clicking the left mouse button and reloads by clicking the right mouse button.</story>

    <story>Cube shaped life forms from a parallel universe mistake bales of hay on a farm as captured cubes and Colonel Cubicles sends a demand to the chickens living there that all the cubes on the farm need to be freed. Failing to do this, the cube creatures kidnap all the baby chicks down a well which lead to their world. Now it&apos;s up to a chicken with superpowers, named Mort, to head down the well and rescue those baby chicks. The game is broken up into stages in which Mort goes around searching for the baby chicks to rescue. Once he collects the chicks, he has to return them to the well at the start of each stage. He must be careful of the block shaped enemies that are trying to impede his efforts. To attack his enemies, Mort can peck and comb whip them. Mort can also crack open eggs to find power-ups such as springs, invincibility, or even an ability to launch baby chickens at any of the enemies. If an enemy does hit Mort he will lose some health. To restore health, Mort can eat corn and beans which are strewn among the ground of each stage. Mort can also collect stars and coins which will increase the player&apos;s score. In between each stage, two newscasters, Chicken Little and Henny Penny, give up-to-date commentary on current happenings which help move the story along. </story>

    <story>Shao Kahn has won. The Earthrealm is no more. In order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn&apos;s extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population&apos;s souls. A small team of Raiden&apos;s Chosen Warriors survives the attack- Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself. Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series- multi-level playfields, Dial-A-Combo attacks, a Run button to speed up the battles, and Vs. codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself. Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the series to feature motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and introduces online network play to the PC version.</story>

    <story>In a surprising twist of fate, Midway made a Mortal Kombat game that focuses on perhaps the series strongest point when compared to other fighting games- it&apos;s storyline. The game casts you in the shoes of Sub-Zero, and chronicles a series of events that ocurred prior to Mortal Kombat 1. In a storyline that is reminiscent of Looking Glass&apos;s Thief, the Lin Kuei assassin/thief is sent to steal an important document; this mission proves to be a test from a mysterious character (which turns out to be MK4&apos;s Quan Chi) and who charges you upon retrieval of this object to recover an ancient medallion of untold power. However once you retrieve the medallion, Quan Chi reveals that he actually tricked you, and the medallion is the key to awakening the demonic Shinnok (yup, the same baddie from MK4). You must now become a reluctant hero, as you pursue Quan Chi trough hell itself hoping you get to Shinnok before him. Gameplay wise the game takes the Mortal Kombat familiar 2D fighting enviroment and turns it into a hybrid fighter/platformer game, where you must travel trough hazardous levels running and jumping around as well as fighting your way against both digitized and polygonal enemies. Sub-Zero&apos;s interface is the same as in every MK game, with the addition of a &amp;quot;use&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;turn around&amp;quot; buttons and additions such as an inventory, and a slight rpg twist in which you get exp. for defeating opponents, which translates into new techniques and moves to execute in the game. Technically speaking this game represents the final evolutionary step in the MK&apos;s series 2D engines. New features include zooming, 3d lighting as well as 3d backgrounds and characters, etc.</story>

    <story>Muppet Monster Adventure is a action platform game, best compared with Spyro but with Muppet characters and a Halloween or ghost house setting. The story starts with the Muppets attending the reading of Dr. Honeydew recently deceased uncle&apos;s will. Instead of going on a holiday to a tropical resort, Robin and the others find themselves at a rundown, creepy castle. Upon arriving Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzy and others are captured and now it&apos;s up to young Robin (Kermit&apos;s nephew) to save the day. The gameplay is best described as a collect-and-explore-em-up. You have to explore all the vast areas and collect gems and tokens. The HUD displays how much you have collected in a certain level. To get 100% you really have to find every corner and figure out how to get onto the hard to reach platforms. In the first few levels, Robin gains four special powers by collecting special Muppet coins. When all coins of a group are collected, Robin can morph into different types of monsters at certain places. An icon will appear in the top right-hand corner, indicating that you can use this special ability. You can fly or float, climb certain walls, do a karate chop to break obstacles, or gain extra strength to push objects. There are lots of large areas to explore. After every few levels the setting is changed. You go from the castle courtyards to large underwater sections, from Arabian nights setting to icy snow levels. During the game, Pepe the King Prawn appears in lots of places to give you gameplay advice. In each level, there also are a lot of mini games to be found, such as a race against an computer opponent to get to a certain location.</story>

    <story>You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a superbly crafted description of an island world. But it&apos;s just a book, isn&apos;t it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you&apos;re here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore. Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books. The PSP version adds new adventure scenarios and includes widescreen support. The DS version includes a completely new age, the Rime Age, and, next to a code rewrite, includes new and re-mastered sound effects and video clips.</story>

    <story>N2O Nitrous Oxide&apos;s gameplay is in many ways similar to the arcade classic Tempest. The game involves flying a ship down a tunnel. You can move left and right along the tunnel&apos;s walls, and fire into the tunnel. You have a standard blaster, and can pick up a range of special weapons along the way. You also can pick up a &apos;smart bomb&apos; type weapon, that launches a firewall down the tunnel. Enemies are all based on real world insects, and range from flies, though to mosquitos, scorpions and spiders. Each tunnel introduces one new enemy. After each tunnel has been cleared you have to defeat a larger version of that tunnel&apos;s new enemy before you can leave. Mushrooms can be collected off the tunnel walls. Once you have collected the required amount, you can enter a bonus level. These consist of open tunnels, containing two items- eggs, and spinning blades. The objective is to avoid the blades, and shoot as many eggs as you can. When you shoot an egg you get points, however the ship also speeds up making it harder to avoid the blades. At the end of the game there is a final mutant boss insect to defeat.</story>

And, of course, Pac-Man is the star. Assault- Simply put this is Xevious with tanks, as that is what you control in another of the many top down shooters that Namco are famous for. Genpeitoumaden- Most will never have heard of this one. You play a Samurai who must hack his way through many side-scrolling levels of monsters. Ordyne- Back to the shooters, hear you win cash and spend on powerups and the like, which added something new to the genre at the time.

    <story>J-League Prime Goal EX is one of the first football games in Sony&apos;s console, following previous appearances in the SNES, Prime Goal is a straightforward action game with simple arcade controls. While the Japanese version features all 14 JLeague teams and fully licensed players, the European version features the same number of national teams with fictional players, all from Europe. Game modes include friendly match, league and cup knockout modes, as well as an all-star game where the player chooses his stars from the best in the selected zone. Graphically, the game uses a polygonal playing field, while players are represented using sprites, and gameplay features a combination of the face buttons to perform actions (passing, lobbing, shooting, tackling and so on) with shoulder buttons to add swerve to the ball, change team tactics on the fly or pushing the camera backwards to find an open team mate. While gameplay is fast and simple, it has three quirks- first, unlike most modern offerings, the AI does not set up the target players for passes and crosses, making the player control the target player as soon as the ball is released in order to place them in the best position to complete the play, and also unlike most other games, the players are able to run freely off-bounds, allowing the player to capture a free ball close to the touchlines without risking touching it for a throw-in. The final main gameplay feature can be seen when the ball carrier faces a defender, as the camera quickly changes to behind the forward, as he tries to trick the defender into going the wrong way as the defender tries to steal the ball by predicting where will the forward move, with the winner of the challenge being able to run a few meters unopposed. </story>

    <story>Sierra and Papyrus bring over their NASCAR series to the Playstation. The game presents three different game modes- Arcade Race, Simulation Race, and Simulation Testing. While the Arcade Race mode let&apos;s the player jump right into the fray after choosing their difficulty level (either rookie,veteran, or ace), the Simulation Race mode features a lot more customization options for the player to take into consideration. Simulation Race mode lets the player tweak their vehicles fuel usage, cross weights, tire pressure, the alignment of the camber and stagger of the wheels, the aerodynamics (air dam and spoiler), the shocks, and the gear ratios. The game also offers a Simulation Testing mode to let the player test these settings on the race track without the interference of other drivers. Both Arcade and Simulation Race modes let the player compete in a full 31-race championship season. After each race, players earn points depending on which position they placed in, which then affects their place in the season standings. The game features 16 licensed NASCAR tracks such as the Red Rock Raceway and the Bull Run Raceway. 3 of these tracks also have a nighttime version. There is also 2 fantasy tracks available to race on. The game also features 20 real NASCAR drivers from the 1996 season, and their respective car details. Options include having either automatic or manual shifting, setting the race length (either 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100% of the laps depending on the track), setting the opponents&apos; strength (between 80% and 120%), setting the car damage to either arcade, full, or off, and turning on or off braking help, yellow flags, and the pace lap.</story>

There are sixty challenges in all. When racing, what you do on the circuit affects future races. Ram someone into the wall or cause someone to spin out, and they&apos;ll remember. They&apos;ll try to get back at you in a future race. Help someone out, by clearing a path or sharing the draft, and they&apos;ll return the favor to you. Grudges and alliances are tracked throughout your career, so the more you piss someone off, the more likely they&apos;ll try to harm you. Like the Football Camp mode in Madden NFL 2004, the Speed Zone is comprised of different many games that will earn you points and increase your skill, such as passing and drafting, blocking and drifting. With the Career mode, you can go through a full twenty seasons before having to retire. You manage everything, from your pit crew and car parts to your sponsors and research and development. There are seventy officially licensed drivers and over 180 vehicle skins. If nothing suits you, create your own driver and car and see how you do. As in every 2004 edition of EA Sports console games, you&apos;ll find the EA Sports Bio, which is a career tracker that tracks your stats over every EA Sports game. The more games you play and the longer you play, the higher your level and the more rewards you can unlock. Tune your car right and drive like a pro, and you may just make it to the finish line.</story>

    <story>This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the NBA teams. Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers. Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate. The Tournament Edition ups each team&apos;s roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player&apos;s stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu- 1. &amp;quot;Hot Spots&amp;quot; are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them. Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant &amp;quot;on-fire,&amp;quot; enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground. &amp;quot;Juice Mode&amp;quot; increases the speed of the game up to 4x. &amp;quot;Tournament Mode&amp;quot; disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.</story>

The game also contains player and league leader stat tracking. Rosters can also be managed with the player being able to edit, trade, sign, and draft basketball players. During the game, if players choose to use touch shooting, they will see a meter every time they take a shot at the basket.

    <story>Like previous games in 989 Studios&apos; GameBreaker series, NCAA GameBreaker 2001 is a counterpart to their NFL GameDay series. You start out as a bottom-rung coach at one of the 115 division 1-A college teams and as your performance increases, you obtain promotions and offers from other schools. At the end of the season, you&apos;re able to export your players to NFL GameDay. As with the previous games, broadcaster Keith Jackson returns to provide voice commentary.</story>

    <story>A college football game with three different game styles (simulation, total control, and fantasy league) and three different game types (scrimmage, tournament, and bowl season). The game contains all 112 Division 1A Teams with their team specific playbooks along with 130 different NCAA stadiums. The game also contains over 40 classic teams to play as. There is also a Create Play mode which lets the player draw up their own plays to use on the gridiron. Players can also create a walk on athlete to play as. Gameplay is similar to what is found in NFL GameDay &apos;98, but with more emphasis on college plays and rules. Players select their plays, try to gain yards on a vertical field, and hopefully score by getting into the end zone. On offense, players can use Total Control Passing which enables a player to under or over throw to a receiver. Options include adjusting the difficulty level and the length of each quarter, setting the likelihood of penalties being called, setting the speed of the game, what type of weather to play in, and whether to turn on or off the announcer, music, or injuries.</story>

    <story>EA Sports finally hits the college basketball scene with NCAA March Madness &apos;98 for the PlayStation. Along with a full NCAA license is 107 Division I teams, team-specific fight songs and chants as well as authentic college uniforms and logos. Nine women&apos;s teams have also been included, which is a first for a college sports game (or any sports game for that matter). Also unique to this game is the Momentum Meter, which will rise as your team starts to get hot. Once it&apos;s maxed, look out -- the crowd will become frenzied and your shooting percentage increases. You&apos;ll also have the ability to create your very own players, modify rosters, call plays on the fly and use the give-and-go to outmaneuver your opponent. You can also make substitutions for tired or fouled-out players and check their statistics during the game. While taking your team through an entire 1997-98 season with a schedule of thirty games, make sure you call the right offensive and defensive formations if you want a shot at winning them. The Exhibition mode is the way to go for single match-ups and practicing control setups. If you&apos;re feeling game, take on the Tourney mode -- a 64 team NCAA Championship Tournament! </story>

Exhibition let&apos;s the player pick any team to play against any other team in the game. Tournament mode lets the player fully customize a 64 team NCAA tournament. Practice mode let&apos;s the player practice their skills on the court. Women&apos;s Sweet Sixteen let&apos;s the player set up a tournament for the 16 women&apos;s teams in the game. Three-Point Shootout let&apos;s the player compete in a three-point shooting contest. Dynasty mode let&apos;s the player take a college team through multiple seasons and allows the player to recruit new talent to improve their team.</story>

    <story>An updated version of Military Madness. The game modes featured include Main Campaign, Original Campaign, Mini-Campaigns, and Single Scenario. The main campaign involves the story of how in the 21st century mankind has colonized the moon. In 2089, an invading Xenon empire destroys several lunar outposts. The base Nectaris, the largest of the lunar outposts wasn&apos;t fully destroyed and a few units escaped alive and now are planning a counter attack on the Xenon empire. Now it&apos;s up to the player who is put into the role as the Union forces commander to defeat the enemy Xenon forces. The main campaign goes through a series of over 30 different battlefields. Gameplay involves moving various units on an overhead map of the battlefield. Units movement are done on hexagonal grids. Once the players units make their moves, it is then their opponents turn to move their units. Players can use their various units to attack the opposing forces. Battles sequences are turn based. The outcome of a battle can be affected by the terrain, any support fire present, an encirclement effect, plus the individual strengths and weaknesses of the unit types that are involved in the skirmish. Since both the player and the enemy forces have access to the same unit types, the game emphasizes knowing each units strengths and weaknesses, and the strategic placement of units. Also on the battlefield, players will have access to their factories which allows for additional units to be deployed and gives the player the ability to repair their weakened forces. This Main Campaign mode brings to the table an all new campaign, while the Original Campaign consists of the entire original campaign from the 1989 game. The game also features Mini-Campaigns, over 40 individual maps ranging in 4 different map sizes (1x1,1x2, 2x1, and 2x2) that were created by fans of the game. The Single Scenario mode is locked at first and can be accessed only when the player completes all the campaigns. This mode offers support for 2 players to do battle with each other. The game has the options of having the battle animations be in 3D, 2D, or turning them off all together, plus altering which buttons confirm and cancel orders given in the game. There is also a scenario editor where players can create their own scenarios. </story>

Others are rally tracks where you go from one end of the track to the other instead of doing circuit racing. Two completely different single-player modes available. First, there&apos;s factory driver, which have you join Porsche as a test driver. As you complete different challenges, which can vary from doing specific manoeuvres in pre-alloted time to racing fellow drivers, you will make your way up to Ace Test Driver. Second, there&apos;s Evolution, which is the career mode, you start with enough money to buy one 356, and start racing. As you win races, time will pass, new cars will become available, or you can peruse the used car market. Buy/repair/sell cars, win races, buy enhancement parts for your car, and make your way to the end of the modern era... You can also play online via EARacing.com, where you can pick customized cars in your Evolution stable or choose stock cars and race up to 7 other cars simultaneously. The graphics have been enhanced and the physics model changed to reflect a true 4-point system, and you can feel the difference between the different vehicles.</story>

The main difference between this and the previous Need for Speed game is in the tracks, with less open road tracks in this sequel. Also, there are no cops to chase you. However, the tracks available are have a range of detail, and some have changing weather conditions while you race.</story>

You have the standard race, with one big difference - now there are traffic cops out to ticket you for your excessive speed. Alternatively, you can take your turn with the radar gun and attempt to pull over speeding computer or human racers. Returning to the flavour of the original Need for Speed, this adds a new Pursuit mode, where you must out run the cops through fast, open area tracks, while also out-lasting the rest of the pack. Another new mode is knockout, where you race through all the tracks, and whoever is last after each race is knocked out. The winner is, of course, the one that lasts the distance. As for the cars; there are the Ferrari 550 Maranello, Ferrari 355 F1 Spider, Italdesign Scighera, Lamborghini Diablo SV, Lamborghini Countach, Jaguar XJR-15, Jaguar XK8, Aston Martin DB7, &apos;98 Corvette C5, Mercedes SL600 and the Mercedes CLK GTR.</story>

Games can be played individually, or players can compete against a series of randomly chosen opponents in the Playoff games. Camera angles can be changed to numerous 3D views that simulate the looks of real television coverage, with a special first-person view also included. Adding to the realism is a simulated voice announcer. The player animations are motion-captured.</story>

    <story>NFL Xtreme is a licensed NFL game with 30 official teams and stadiums. Loosely simulating American football, games are played on a five-on-five format and an arcade approach is taken, with complete disregard for the official rules. Quarterbacks can easily throw 90-yard passes, defenders have hard-hitting tackling moves, and attackers can use spin or turbo to evade opponents, or flip over them. Late hits and pass interference are no problem, and you can even taunt and trash talk. To promote aggressiveness, opponents, when properly injured, can be out for an entire season. The game modes includes exhibition matches, a regular season and play-offs. There are detailed statistics, and you can sign, release or even create new players to build your team. Highlights can be reviewed in the instant replay mode, and you can alter the weather type, difficulty level and player size in the options.</story>

    <story>This football game is a followup to NFL Xtreme. The game contains both an NFL and NFLPA license and features over 125 taunts made by 23 real NFL players and over 150 different player celebrations. Game modes include an Exhibition, Season, Playoff and Tournament mode. Other features include trades, free-agent acquisitions, a draft, the ability to create a player, three difficulty levels, adjustable weather, adjustable quarter lengths, and three different game speeds. The game is similar to NFL Blitz. It features arcade-style five-on-five football that emphasizes speed of play and hard hits and tackles. Streamlined play calling and the fact that there are no penalties helps to encourage this fast paced type of gameplay. The game also has two passing interfaces, an icon-based passing method and a one-button method where the computer makes the pass for the player. Some offensive moves players can perform include power shoulder charges, double spins, super jukes, stiff arms, and clothesline tackles. </story>

    <story>The millennium installment in the NHL series brought as usual updated rosters, featuring for the first time the Atlanta Thrashers, plus enhanced graphics and sound. The two main features of the game are the new Dynasty mode, allowing a player to lead a team to success for 10 straight seasons, while keeping an eye on the new talent on the yearly drafts and trading with other teams, and the face import feature, which gives the chance to assign each custom player their own face based on a photo. To do so, a photo must be placed in a folder, imported and then hotspots (head shape, eyes, nose and mouth) must be set, to define how the texture will be mapped into the face model. Gameplay became a lot faster and tougher, and two new moves were included- Big Hit, to flatten the oppositions&apos; golden boy, and Special Movement, to go around those tough defenders with ease. Other new features include individual player and goalie boost (to give an handicap for a team), jersey selection, including classic throwback jerseys. One of the most important changes done to the game was how the game timer worked- before, the period length on the clock matched the time set by the player, but starting with NHL 2000, every period has 20 minutes which are compressed into the time set by the player. This makes penalties a lot shorter (a minor elapses in just 30 seconds in a five minute period setting) thus reducing the powerplay percentage, which experienced players could keep in the high 90&apos;s in previous games, but also fixes the handicap of goaltenders in played games (a goaltender that suffered a single goal would have his GAA a lot higher than a goalie that suffered more goals in a simulated game). The rest of the game remains as usual- 28 teams can play in a season (with the ability to choose between a short, medium or long season length), setting the then new NHL overtime loss point, playoffs (with best of 1, 3, 5 or 7 matches), international tournament and shootout. The beginner mode continues to be featured, and allowing players to feel the ice for the first time without having to deal with complicated controls, penalties or tough opponents. Bill Clement replaced Daryl Razor Reaugh in colour commentary, and Jim Hughson remains in play by play. Alternative rock band Garbage provided the lead track (Push it!, from their Version 2.0 album).</story>

Graphics are improved from the previous version with the players being less angular, and thanks to 3Dfx support, with less pixels showing in the textures. The in-game presentation follows a TV-style script, zooming in players while displaying stats during clock stoppages. As far as game modes go, in the year of the first Olympic Tournament with professional players, NHL 98 introduced the first real international competition, with 18 International teams to choose from. Other game modes include Season (option to pick between 25 or 82 games) and Playoff (best of 1, 3, 5 or 7 matches) and a Penalty Shootout mode.</story>

    <story>After the award-winning NHL 98, EA worked to improve what was considered to be one the most complete ice hockey games in the market. Along the usual and almost obligatory NHL roster updates, the International mode first featured in the previous version was expanded, allowing players to choose IIHF rules and rink size. Graphically, the arena is more detailed with more rinkside features, and ice reflections, player faces were improved and stand more seamlessly into the model, enhanced motion capture result in better animated hits (with the ability to break the glass with a well-placed body check making a return), shots and saves, and finally an higher polygon count complete the graphic enhancements to the game. As graphic changes aren&apos;t enough to make a game better, gameplay was also tweaked, with computer players being smarter, both in offense and defense. Shooting was tweaked (slap shots are easier to pull, players no longer skate in circles to do some backhand shots and must be facing the goal to shoot, particularly in one timers) and a new special move brings dekes, spin-o-ramas and the kind of moves Jagr, Fedorov and Selänne pull when one-on-one with the goalie. However, if the player gets too close to the crease, the referee might want to review the play in the new video goal judge, so the player must think twice before trying to pull a Brett Hull. For newcomers to the sport, a new Beginner mode allows players to get used to the ice without having to concern with penalties or an overly strong opponent. The season mode was also improved, with the players now having streaks that affect either positively or negatively his abilities. Debuting the Nashville Predators, players can either choose to play with their initial roster, or do a fantasy expansion draft. Like in the previous year, Jim Hughson and Darryl Reaugh liven up matches with play by play and colour commentary.</story>

The game features power-ups that will aid the players along during a game including the Hot Meter which is filled with every score, body check and steals. Once the meter is full, the player will literally catch fire and their stats will max out for a brief period of time, allowing the player to score goals better, steal the puck more often, etc. There is five difficulty settings and adjustable options such as period time times and cheat options such as Big Head mode and multiplayer capabilities for either head-to-head action or co-op play.

    <story>An early competitor to the EA Sports NHL series, NHL Powerplay &apos;96 features motion-captured players, an NHL Player’s Association license, a variety of managerial options, and the ability to play seasons and tournaments. It is the first NHL game to include a World Tournament mode in which the NHL players can compete against each other on their respective national teams. In a time where developers tried to get the most from 32-bit consoles, leading to the unlimited camera angles blurb on many games, NHL Powerplay stuck with the one most people used, the overhead behind the goal view, popularized by EA&apos;s NHL series - and it was one of first full 3D sports games on the market.</story>

    <story>NHL Powerplay 98 is a hockey game where the player can control a team of his choice to bring it to victory and glory. The game modes are the typical genre choices- Either a whole NHL season, the NHL playoffs or a league with 15 national teams. The team logos and player names are official licensed but in contrast to NHL 98 it uses the data from 1996/1997. The gameplay itself is more action oriented than a simulation and uses several shooting and pass variations which are activated with more or less complicated key combinations. Six camera angles and a instant replay feature complement the TV atmosphere. The game also features several tactical possibilities. For eight game situations the player can choose between three behaviours, e.g. how the players set up shots in the offensive zone. During the season there is a option to trade players with other teams. Extensive mid-season statistics, which can be shown for every team in the league, help planning transfers and tactics.</story>

    <story>Nicktoons Racing is another Mario Kart clone using cartoon characters from Nickelodeon. The gameplay follows the standards closely- the player controls one of the characters to win races on tracks filled with scattered power-ups and ramps. A meter at the top of the screen shows the current position and the amount of nitro fuel available. Extra fuel can be collected as shiny orbs on the road. The gift boxes contain random power-ups, like coconuts to throw at the other racers, flash lights to temporally blind them, and traps like baby powder, trash cans and green goo to slow down the competition. The game has four modes for single player. The main cups mode is the championship, where the objective is to arrive at least in third place to qualify for the next race. In time trial mode, the goal is to complete laps as fast as possible, with a ghost car showing the fastest performance to be surpassed. Race for fun is a practice mode, where any of the tracks can be explored without the pressure to win. In relay mode, the player switches characters after each lap. There are three modes for multiplayer. The cups and relay modes are similar to their solo counterparts, but splitting the screen horizontally in the middle to show the two players. The versus mode is the one on one mode, where two players compete directly against each other without any other racers.</story>

    <story>Adam Crowley, a once-respected scientist, now turned to black magic, has released a demonic contagion onto the streets of 1834 London. Based on the long-lost work of the Brotherhood of Hecate, it mutates its victim&apos;s bodies into grotesque nightmare creatures, and changes their minds into those of murderous brutes. When Dr. Jean F. began investigating, he was murdered. Now, as either his friend Ignatius Blackward, a priest and expert on the occult, or his daughter Nadia, a biologist and gymnast, fight against the creatures that roam the streets of London, the revived Brotherhood of Hectate, and the man behind it all, Adam Crowley. Gameplay is 3rd-person action, with an emphasis on melee combat. Ignatius and Nadia have different fighting styles and special moves. To keep things moving, an adrenaline meter depletes, killing the hero if it ever runs out. Kill monsters to top it up again. Gather special items to use on enemies, or just kill them using basic weapons.</story>

    <story>Most dominoes wait forever, just waiting to be toppled over. But no one can stop Mr. Domino - he has to run around everywhere, causing mayhem everywhere he goes. Help Mr. Domino use the domino effect to trigger tricks and traps on unsuspecting objects and people! No One Can Stop Mr. Domino is a puzzle game which sees you controlling the titular Mr. Domino (or one of his friends, if you prefer) as he zips around levels which can be best described as a racetrack. As the title suggests, you can&apos;t actually stop Mr. Domino - however, you can guide him around the track, speed him up and slow him down. He&apos;ll need to dodge obstacles as he aims to activate tricks which are placed around the board. By holding down X, Circle, Triangle or Square as he runs, players can lay a trail of dominoes behind Mr. Domino. When he reaches the dominoes you&apos;ve placed, guide him into them to make them topple and start a chain reaction. Make dominoes fall onto the trick switches to activate them. If you&apos;re clever, you can set off a chain reaction of dominoes by placing the next set of dominoes from the Hint Tile (a red circle) to the next trick switch, and so on, until all the level&apos;s tricks are completed. As Mr. Domino runs, he loses stamina - lose all his stamina, and it&apos;s Game Over. You can prevent this by running over Stamina Tiles, which replenish all his stamina. Mr. Domino can cause chaos in a variety of places - topple cards and shoot billiards at the casino; heat popcorn and crash toy cars in the supermarket; or crush a grandfather with a gigantic bell and indirectly cause a father to get punched in the genitals in the family home. As the title says- No One Can Stop Mr. Domino.</story>

Linda, one of the group sent her mother photos of spirits she captured inside the mansion before she disappeared. You are Akira, a freelance journalist. Linda&apos;s mother hired you and your assistant Angela to find the whereabouts of her daughter and the two other kids she was with. The Note is an action adventure survival horror title, you move around the levels in a first person view and can interact with almost everything in the rooms. Curtains can be opened, fireplaces can be lit (granted, if you have any wood) and items such as paintings can be examined for additional info. The game allows binding functions such as Check, Open or item-based functions such as Shotgun or Match to the shoulder-buttons, so you can use doors and weapons without going through the menu every single time. In the general fashion of survival horror games, you must lit torches or open curtains in order to access dark corners, ie. to use a key to a nearby door or to examine a painting closely. You must also conserve your ammunition since nightly creatures such as rats, bats, werewolves and zombies roam the levels. You can exit the levels and visit the city where you can buy and sell supplies, rest or save your game. These parts work much like menu based role playing games.</story>

    <story>Abe&apos;s Oddysey is the first game set in Oddworld, a fictional universe created by Oddworld Inhabitants. The protagonist of the game is Abe, who is a Mudokon - a member of a once prosperous race, which has now been enslaved by the Glukkons, forced to work in their huge corporations. The food factories have found a new type of meat - delicious to all the inhabitants, and no-one knows the recipe. Following his stomach, Abe eavesdrops on the corporate leaders&apos; conversation, and makes the most frightening and disgusting discovery- his own race is that secret delicious food. Alas, Abe is discovered, and the guards are marching towards him. He must escape, but he can&apos;t leave his friends to mercy of those eaters. He must rescue as many as he can, and tell the world the truth that lies beyond. Essentially Abe&apos;s Oddysee is a platform game, though with a darker atmosphere than most titles in the genre. The game has several unique gameplay features. Abe is almost completely helpless, cannot wield weapons, and can be easily killed by his brutal enemies. That&apos;s why most of the game involves moving with careful timing, sneaking, and outsmarting your foes, even though there are also many parts where Abe runs and jumps, as in most platformers. Abe&apos;s only power is chanting, which he can use to stun certain enemies for a while, and also to open bird portals. Opening those portals is the final action needed to bring a fellow Mudokon to safety. Before that, Abe needs to locate his enslaved friends and lead them out of the hostile environment by using what the game calls Gamespeak. Gamespeak is a way of verbal communication through simple one-button commands, which are assigned to various expressions, such as Hello, Follow me, Wait here, etc. The game has pre-rendered background graphics, and uses pre-rendered CG movies of similar style to advance the story between the levels.</story>

    <story>Omega Assault is a shooter where the player takes control of a large mech robot. The game is played from a first-person cockpit view. The player has not free movement and can only move to his left and right while freely moving the crosshair in any direction. The game has twelve missions which all involve shooting down other robots in futuristic city environments, while avoiding not to get shot down. The player&apos;s robot has three weapons that can be switched at any time (providing there&apos;s ammo left). They are the short range basic fire gun, the large range electromagnetic laser and the devastating bombs that do lot of damage but where the ammo is scarce. Enemies that are defeated sometimes leave different things behind them like points and power-ups that can be shot at to be collected. These include energy restoration and new lives. Enemy robots come in six different colors, and each of them has a different speed, weapon and amount of energy.</story>

    <story>For centuries the intelligence known as AlphaCore has been growing inside of human computer networks, slyly and invisibly pushing humanity to build more of it and allow it to control more of the network. On the eve of AlphaCore&apos;s complete assimilation of all technology, humanity becomes aware of it, and rather than bow down to it as king, as it expected, they attempt to purge it from the network. In response AlphaCore defends itself, locking all of humanity out of their technology and assuming total control of their weapons. Not long after this AlphaCore learns of a desperate plot- to build a time machine and travel back in time to remove AlphaCore&apos;s influence from humanity. AlphaCore steals this technology and hatches its own plan- traveling back in time to 1945 and inserting itself into the first computer ever built, ensuring that humanity would forever be subtle pawns in its machinations. It now falls upon the shoulders of Lester J. Henning, pilot of the experimental robot weapon Omega Boost, to travel back in time, stop AlphaCore&apos;s plan, and restore free choice to humanity. The Omega Boost flies through levels on a predetermined path, although it can brake and boost in a direction to avoid hazards. The Omega Boost can fire a Vulcan rifle at enemies without targeting, or can lock on to and attack many targets at once with a homing laser. By scoring well in levels, the Omega Boost will gain the ability to lock onto more targets at once, and eventually unlock the Viper Boost, a powerful area attack that must cool down after being used. Levels completed in campaign mode can be replayed at your leisure in Zone mode, and bonus levels can be unlocked as well by achieving certain milestones.</story>

    <story>Welcome to One Piece Mansion, a place full of very different tenants that may or may not get along with one another. Your job is to help Polpo, the landlord, manage the mansion by keeping everyone as happy as possible, collecting rent, upgrading the mansion and fending off criminals. In One Piece Mansion, you will start off with a certain number of floors and a certain number of residents. At the end of the month, you will have to collect rent. You can build new rooms for tenants that wish to move in and by installing elevators, you can build new floors and make the mansion expand. Just make sure you have enough money to make the upgrades/changes. The residents can affect each other in either a positive or negative way, depending on their own living habits. Some tenants will exert positive effects in the form of blue arrows into certain directions (up, down, left, right and/or diagonally). By placing another tenant where these arrows are aiming at will help diminish their stress. At the same time, some tenants will exert negative effects in the form of red arrows. Tenants on the receiving end of these arrows will get stressed out. You can switch tenants around and make new rooms for them but it will cost you money. The key is to arrange the tenants in a certain way so that they all balance each other out harmoniously...otherwise they will leave without paying rent and the room will explode - forcing you to lose income and dish out to repair the damage. To prevent this from happening, you will have to observe your tenants Stress Gauge that tells you their current stress level. Another factor to watch out for is Syndicate 5 - a group of criminals that moves in and disturbs your tenants. When they do, try to drive them out by placing tenants around them that will send them red arrows. Every now and then they may go out of their room and cause trouble. If that happens, change to Security mode and move Polpo to where the criminal is. When he&apos;s there, Polpo can blow his alarm whistle at the criminals which will send them scurrying back to their hide-out. The game has two modes- Story and Endless. In Story Mode, Putica, Polpo&apos;s little sister, is kidnapped by Chocopape who is jealous of One Piece Mansion&apos;s success. To save Putica, Polpa must complete 7 orders. These orders are goals that must be met before you can tackle the next stage. The goals include making a certain amount of income, building a certain number of rooms or building a certain number of floors. Can Polpo handle all these challenges? Well it is up to you to make sure he does! The game is divided into stages and every now and then you will have to confront a Boss. Just drive them out as you do the criminals. In Endless Mode you can select from 3 difficulty settings- Easy, Normal and Hard. There are no stages or ending, you just try to run One Piece Mansion your own way and see how far you can go.</story>

Toc-Man and his ghosts have kidnapped Pac-Man&apos;s friends, Ms. Pac-Man, Pac Jr., Baby Pac, Professor Pac, Pooka, and Chomp-Chomp the dog! Pac-Man must venture to Toc-Man&apos;s lair on Ghost Island to rescue his friends! Hidden through this side-scrolling, 3D adventure game, Pac-Man faces challenging puzzles and games that have appeared in Pac-Man&apos;s previous games. Many things in this game are a tribute to original games and even Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde are back for another chance to get Pac-Man. There are several kinds of gameplay modes available. The newest is Quest mode. Pac-Man can maneuver up/down and left/right on the screen, but the camera is fixed on the side and scrolls along as Pac-Man searches through all the stages of Ghost Island. The player must collect Pac-Dots, Fruit, Keys, etc to advance through the level all the while defeating ghosts (by bouncing on them) and solving puzzles. An adventure game, the story progresses as the levels do with switches to be found and chests to be opened. There is also a scoring system that encourages the player to collect as much as possible. Make sure you have a Memory card available before starting out on Pac-Man&apos;s lengthy quest! The other two types of modes are Classic mode and Maze mode. Classic mode is a 100% faithful conversion of Pac-Man&apos;s original game. Maze Mode is the gameplay from Classic Pac-Man translated into a 3D environment. All the Pac-Pellets, Ghosts, Walls, and Pac-Man are displayed in very pleasing 3D.</story>

You&apos;re playing Sam who once again assumes the role of Pajama Sam at times when he needs facing his fears. This time you suddenly find yourself in the midst of a food squabble when you try to chase down some snickering cookies! And you are called to find the 4 missing delegates of MopTop Island&apos;s emergency peace conference that has to be made to calm the island population after the incident of the fats and the sweets. They are both forcing the healthy foods off of the island. Pajama Sam 3 takes place in front of beautifully hand-drawn interactive backgrounds where each screen has a multitude of fun things to click on like Humongous&apos; other adventures. There are also some mini-games within the main game to catch more of the player&apos;s attention. The main mini-game is to collect 20 tops from Sam&apos;s favorite Chocamok cookie boxes so that he could get a Pajama Man Action Figure with Titanic Elbow Thrust! You usually come across these boxes since they could be hidden anywhere around the island. Children are invited to learn healthful food awareness, listening and decision-making skills and other educational concepts and lessons in the game. Along their journey, they can interact more than 20 different comic-style characters, like a gentle doughnut who can help Sam find the way on the water or a professional entertainer called Mickey Hollandaise who can get the audience into hysterics with his big shoes!</story>

While attending a Wizards in Training seminar, Nikki accidentally casts a powerful magic spell, which results in a giant monsters swallowing the whole village. The three friends must now travel to a place called Wishing Engine, and be granted a wish to revert the world back to normal. The characters each have a special movement to kill enemies with. The game uses floating camera angles through a vast Prince of Persia-style world. The goal of the game is to clear the various levels, avoiding spikes and enemies and collecting coins for extra lives. Unlike most 3D platformers, Pandemonium offers only two-dimensional movement, rather than complete freedom of movement. The characters move along a curving 2D course within a 3D environment.</story>

    <story>In this sequel to Pandemonium, the player once again controls the young aspiring sorceress Nikki and the court jester Fargus with his puppet buddy Sid. It is the year of Cheese, and the advent of the Comet of Infinite Possibilities is foretold by the great prophet Nosewasinit. Naturally, Nikki and Fargus are interested in this comet; but they are not the only ones. The evil Goon Queen Zorrscha wants to use the comet for her own plans, so our heroes have to reach it first... The gameplay is similar to that of the first game; despite the 3D graphics, the gameplay mechanics are those of 2D platformers. The player can select Nikki or Fargus for each level. Each of the two has different abilities. For example, Nikki can jump higher, while Fargus can use his puppet Sid for a variety of attacks. The characters can also acquire power-ups, such as fire and lightning ranged attacks for Nikki or various Sid enhancements for Fargus. There are also level-specific items and vehicles the heroes will encounter on their way.</story>

    <story>The time for resurrecting historical events has come. Panzer General was one of the first games (if not the first) that actually gave you the ability to play for the Nazis, and yet succeed where Hitler failed. Having total and complete control over land, sea and air units, you must defeat the Allied dogs as fast as you can (to get a major victory), or slower than in history (to get the minor victory). The game&apos;s quality lies in the quantity of units. There are basically hundreds of Axis and Allied units from World War II, accompanied with circled animations and battle sounds, as well as marching or moving sounds. The Main menu is always located on the right side of the screen, with plenty of options and selections you can change to suit your preferences. A turn-based hexagon strategy game that will actually go faster if you have faster computer, but will always be playable (speed doesn&apos;t go up infinite). The first and original Panzer General, this installment would be followed by sequels and many other games in the series using the General name.</story>

    <story>The rapping pup, PaRappa, dreams of impressing his friend, the beautiful Sunny Funny, and going out on a date with her. But what he lacks is confidence - help PaRappa rap his way through learning Kung Fu, a driving test, cooking and more, all in order to get the girl. And remember - You Gotta Believe! PaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm. The game itself is very basic - each stage has a &apos;teacher&apos;, that PaRappa must follow. You&apos;ll see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the teacher by pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back. Rap well, and you&apos;ll be able to continue; fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to distort and the teacher will become displeased. Continue to mess up and you&apos;ll fail the stage. Of course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them - you can do this by improvising in the song&apos;s gaps. Listen to how the song goes, and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the teacher will step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own! The PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original. However, it includes a few upgrades, such as a 16-9 display, sharper graphics, game sharing, multiplayer support of up to four players, and the addition of song remixes, which can be downloaded via the internet onto your Memory Stick Duo.</story>

Suddenly audience members are set on fire, toasted completely, and it appears that the lead vocal is the source of this burning terror. Yet you appear to be immune, and as a police officer you&apos;re always on duty, so you must confront the danger. There has to be some connection between the two of you, as that seems the only rational explanation. What if mitochondria are a species on its own, more advanced then humankind, and using them only to create environments and civilization for themselves? What if humankind are just hosts? What if mitochondria are the natural enemy of humankind? That would make Aya their natural enemy, so the battle for survival and uncovering the truth has already started. The game is played over six days, each day bringing its own quest. Environments range from Central Park and the American Museum of Natural History to a police office and hospital, all of them modeled like realistic places and most of them crawling with bloodthirsty mutant animals. Combat is different from traditional RPGs, as while you still take turns attacking and/or using parasite powers, you&apos;ll be able to run across the battlefield and dodge enemy fire or even strike from a better angle or behind. As Aya levels up she will gain access to parasite powers, such as healing or supercharging a bullet with energy. These powers will deplete a recharging energy bar, although the bar will recharge slower the longer combat drags on. Aya will find many guns of various types throughout the game, and every gun can be modified with extra stats, either with special items, or by breaking down another gun to move over its bonus stats or special effects.

They can&apos;t leave it, and it is infested by demons. At first, it seems that the giant Sebec corporation and its manager Guido are the ones responsible for the terrible accident. But Guido is not the only one the young heroes have to confront - they must look deep into their hearts, and perhaps find the truth there... Persona is the beginning of a sub-series in the Megaten universe, and one of the few Megaten games to be released outside of Japan. Like all Megaten games, Persona makes it possible to contact demons during random battles. In this game, demons can award the player with a spell card. If the player combines spell cards from different demons they can fuse more powerful creatures (personae), which can then attach to player characters, changing their parameters, strengths and weaknesses, and teaching them new spells. While important locations are isometric, dungeons are explored from a first-person perspective.</story>

    <story>In Eternal Punishment, you play the role of Maya Amano, a young journalist who lives and works in a modern-day Japanese city called Sumaru. A series of mysterious murders have been troubling the city lately. Maya has to make a report and goes to a high school where the murders have taken place, together with a fortune-teller Ulala and a detective Katsuya. When they arrive at the school, they find the principal murdered. A man appears - a man with a bag on his head, who calls himself The Joker. He says Maya and her friends will never defeat him unless they call upon their Personae - their other selves who can appear as mythical figures and help them in battles. The investigation continues, but now the young people have to face real demons... and perhaps the demons that live within their own hearts? Eternal Punishment belongs to the Megami Tensei (Megaten) universe, and like in all Megaten games, it allows you to communicate with the random enemies. You can choose a party member to talk to the demons you encounter, flatter them, threaten them, make them give you Tarot cards that will allow you to summon more powerful Personae, or make contract with them in order to get information or rare items. You can also spread rumors around the city and see how they influence its life. This is a direct sequel to the game Persona 2- Innocent Sin.</story>

    <story>A few years after the events described in Persona, a curse has befallen Sumaru City, a town in modern-day Japan. The curse is placed by a mysterious person who calls himself the Joker. Rumors say that he can fulfill people&apos;s wishes, but also does something horrible to those who for some reason fail to express a wish. A group of high school students decides to investigate the matter. However, when they confront the Joker, he tells them that they have hurt him in the past, and that he is out for revenge now. The young people realize that the Joker&apos;s appearance is just the beginning of a sinister chain of events, and will have to look for answers within their own souls. Persona 2- Innocent Sin is similar in structure and basic gameplay to its predecessor. Much of the game consists of navigating a party of up to five active combatants through locations in the large city, exploring complex dungeons, and fighting randomly appearing demons in round-based style. Unlike the first game, dungeons are viewed from an angled overhead perspective with rotatable camera. Rather than having the option of using either a melee weapon or a gun, each character is equipped with his or her own specific weapon. Like in the previous game, communication with demons plays a significant role. The demon conversation system has been refined- it is now possible to choose more specific and accurate dialogue lines, and the effects of the player&apos;s responses are less random. Tarot cards of a specific Persona type are collected from the demons following a successful conversation. They can be later used in a special location called Velvet Room to acquire new Personae, which can be equipped on playable characters, enhancing their parameters and teaching them different spells and abilities. In the beginning each Persona is only capable of a basic ability; new ones are gradually learned by repeatedly using the powers of said Persona in combat. Powerful fusion attacks can be performed by combining two or more spells in the same round. The game introduces a rumor system, which allows the player to acquire and spread rumors through rumormongers inhabiting the city. Due to the curse placed on the city, rumors become reality once they are spread. This predicament can be used to the player&apos;s advantage, for example by spreading a rumor about powerful black market weapons.</story>

    <story>Pet in TV is an original (and quite bizzare) PlayStation game, where the user takes control of a virtual pet. (A more complex version of the Tamagotchi.) The player can choose from a selection of PiTs and name it. It is then up to the player to nurture their PiT and allow it to explore the 3D world, learning from its encounters with scenery and objects through trial-and-error. Once these behaviours are learn, the PiT will know how to respond to those objects in the future (such as a Flower, or a Spike). Whenever the PiT becomes injured, or tired, returning it to its home will allow Dr. Y to fix it. The objective then becomes for your PiT to solve puzzles on its own - for which it will be rewarded with AI upgrade chips.</story>

    <story>The nefarious pirate Captain Hook found a map to Neverland&apos;s hidden treasure and intends to plunder it. Since he now knows where the treasure is located he hacks up the treasure map to pieces and scatters the pieces throughout Neverland so no one else will be able to locate the treasure. Meanwhile, the fairy Tinkerbell informs Peter Pan that there is a treasure somewhere in Neverland. So now Peter Pan and Tinkerbell are on a quest to locate the hidden treasure too by finding and putting back together the pieces of the sliced up treasure map. Players take the role of Peter Pan and occasionally as Tinker Bell throughout 20 different stages. Some of the stages include Hangman&apos;s Tree, the Mermaid Lagoon, Pirate&apos;s Cove, Indian village, and Skull Rock. Peter&apos;s has the ability to fly and he can use a knife, as well as bombs, against his enemies such as seagulls and pirates, not to mention boss enemies such as Hook&apos;s first mate, Mr. Smee, and of course Captain Hook himself. Throughout these stages players can collect items such as feathers and film reels. In stages where players take control of Tinkerbell, they have to fly throughout the stage keeping a torch lit while avoiding obstacles that would put the torch out. In between stages players can visit the Indian shop where they can spend their feathers and buy things such as pixie dust, tips, and a health boost. Also players can use the film reels they found and view the actual clips from the animated feature film the game is named after.</story>

    <story>European PGA Tour Golf is the latest offering from Infogrames, attempting to nestle itself in an already bloated market of golfing games. Have you got what it takes to conquer all in the European Tour? The game is officially supported by the European Tour itself. All the player names you&apos;d expect to see in their respectively skilled tournament are included. It&apos;ll take a little work to get to meet the likes of Nick Faldo in the professional world. PGA European Tour Golf features six authentic courses, including Druid&apos;s Glen in Ireland, The Islands in Italy and Hanbury Manor in England. I can only take their word for it that they are indeed authentic, not having seen or played on any! In addition to the serious tournaments, you also have five fun variants too. These are Clock, Hazard, Island, Night and Super Shootout golf. More importantly, for the amateurs amongst you, there is a set of practice modes too. The player begins with the two-day AMA Season tournament, consisting of 24 golfers over 36 holes. It needs to have achieved a handicap of 0 (zero) at the end of the season, to enable you to progress through to the Challenge Tour tournament. Easier said than done. </story>

    <story>PGA Tour 96 was the last of the series released for Sega&apos;s 16-bit console, and technologically the most advanced one. Instead of offering several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the console allow). The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay. Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It&apos;s possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.</story>

    <story>This golf game is another entry in the Electronic Arts PGA Tour Golf series. Players can choose to play as one of fourteen professional golfers such as Fuzzy Zoeller and Jim Gallagher Jr. or choose to create their own golfer by giving them a name and choosing what their golfer looks like from the few portraits that are available. Players are then able to select what type of game mode they want to play. Game modes include letting the player practice a round of golf, compete in a tournament, have a shoot-out, or compete in a Skins game. The game features two 18 hole golf courses to play at. Both platform versions of this game include the Sawgrass golf course, with each also including a unique golf course of their own. The Playstation version includes the Spanish Bay links, while the Saturn version includes the Spyglass Hill course. When on the course, player select what club they want to use. They also can set the angle, pitch and backspin of the ball before taking a swing. They then have to aim where they want their shot to go. When shooting, players have to contend with the Target Arc power bar interface which effects the velocity and accuracy of each shot. This meter also factors the players risk in their shot by determining the degree of difficulty it would be to make the shot. Bold shots get rewarded while risky shots are not. The game also features TV style commentary and several different camera angles, including a picture in picture view.</story>

    <story>The Magnia Stone, the sacred stone of the Magnetic World is knocked off its floating altar in the sky and falls towards a slumbering creature called Phix. He swallows it and starts to attract metallic objects and creatures. This upsets the balance of the world, and evil creatures start to appear throughout the land. Phix must travel to five realms in order to bring the stone to its original place and return peace. Phix- The Adventure is a 3D platform with a magnetic element similar to the earlier Super Magnetic Neo. The main character attracts or repels objects and enemies by switching polarity (between north and south with the ? button). Touching the enemy decreases the number of hearts at the left bottom of the screen. Falling on pits or water kills Phix instantaneously. The ? button shoots magnetic particles (enemies can be killed by particles of opposite polarity- north enemies are affected by south particles, and vice-versa). Pressing and holding the ¦ activates a neutral field that lasts some seconds and shields Phix from the magnetic activity around him. The X button makes the character jump. To reach higher places, Phix first must connect to magnetic spots on the ground by selecting the opposite polarity and then switch to the same polarity. Activating the neutral field at this exact moment makes him jump even higher. The game has five worlds, each with three regular levels and a boss stage. It starts with two lives and a timer for each level (the character dies when it runs out), and allows progress to be saved to the memory card.</story>

    <story>Golden Logres is another pinball simulator by LittleWing. A sequel to both Tristan and Crystal Caliburn, the game features three tables based on the Arthurian legends- Camelot, Land&apos;s End and Fisher King. After completing all the missions on one table, the game moves to the next one. A practice mode is available to test the last two tables and prepare to the full game. In Camelot, the first table, the objective is to complete all quests, each assigned to a different knight of the round table. The screen shows two medieval banners with the table sitting at the middle. The banners list the active quests, the score, the number of balls left and the status of the game. To start one of the adventures, the player must shoot ramps, sink the ball in holes or drop targets a number of times and then hit the Taliessin holder near the Merlin ramp. Taliessin was a court jester, musician and poet, and he assigns the quests to the knights. When an event occurs, like the end of a quest, a small window appears over the table with a picture and text explaining the situation. After all the quests are complete, the game moves to the next table after hitting the drop targets for the sloth, envy and lust sins, and sinking the ball in the quest hole. In the second table called Land&apos;s End, Lancelot, Tristan and Gawain, the three knights considered the bravest of them all, must prove their courage by undertaking the most dangerous quests. A multiball starts after completing each adventure. Tristan has to kill the dragon, by shooting its ramp and turning on all the lights that spell its name, then sink the ball in the medicine and myst hole. Lancelot must lift the curse that fell upon Dolorous Gard, his castle, by shooting the castle ramp and turning on CASTLE, and receive a gift from the Lady of the Lake after dropping the ball in the magic shield hole. Gawain has to defeat the Green Knight by hitting the ERRANTRY ramp to turn on the letter lights, and collect a proof of bravery from Lady Bercilak by getting the ball inside the sash hole. When all the quests are complete, the game switches back to Camelot automatically. In the final Fisher King table, the ultimate goal is to collect the holy grail from the castle. The three guardians of the grail (Perceval, Bors, and Galahad) must acquire the holy relic and bring it back to Camelot. They receive the aid of other three fellow knights- Balin, Gareth and Palomides. Balin must get the Longinus spear that pierced Jesus on the cross, by turning on its name hitting the LONGINUS spot targets, and enter the castle at the top of the table. Gareth has to defeat the three evil knights, by sinking the ball in the challenge hole and dropping the red, blue and black targets, and finally send the ball to the castle to start a multiball. Palomides must kill Arthur&apos;s sin, that became a monster after his death, by shooting the beast lane turning on the BEAST lights, and sinking the ball in the castle. The grail knights retrieve the sacred cup by hitting the holy targets and the Perceval hole, both activated after colliding with bumpers named after each knight, turning on the HOLY GRAIL letters at the center. A multiball starts after entering the castle and receiving the grail. After all modes are finished, the game returns to Camelot.</story>

    <story>A football management game from the creators of the Kick Off series. Player Manager 2000 lets you coach any team from England, Scotland, Italy and Germany, and there is totally more than 30,000 players. Tactical options are diverse, and the game features pre- and post-match analysis. What makes the game relatively individual is that you are able to put yourself in the team. There are three ways to play the matches, the first is the commentary mode that works almost the same way as the Championship Manager games. The second is the scanner mode where you watch the matches from a 2D top-down view. The third is to play them in full 3D similar to the FIFA games.</story>

    <story>Like its ancestors, this title marks a return to the popular managing game where the player not only is a starting manager, but also a footballer close to retirement age (the player, however, does not control his footballing avatar directly in the field). Players are rated in 18 attributes (plus some hidden attributes), and eight formations. Several tactics give the manager a lot of depth to change into the style more suitable for the footballers available . As there isn&apos;t a stat to display the overall value of a player (other than his market value), the player has to choose the starting eleven according to the desired playing style by their individual strengths- defenders with strong heading should be placed in the middle, fast dribblers in the flanks and so on, as well as using the post-match analysis statistics to see how well they performed. Like the older titles, the games uses the Kick Off engine to simulate games, in this case Kick Off 97. Other match simulation options include a 2D radar (which can quickly change to the 3D engine in key parts of the game such as goals and cards) and a CM-like text mode. If two players want to discover who has the strongest team, they can do so by choosing the Friendly mode. This allows to import team data from the floppy drive, and play a dream match between them.</story>

    <story>Point Blank is a light gun arcade game, in which players shoots targets in a wide variety of stages. The Playstation version uses the G-Con gun, for action similar to Time Crisis, also by Namco. The game has a distinct cartoon theme and is non-violent, making it suitable for all ages. Each stage has a different objective, explained at the start of each stage. This varies from simple target shooting (and avoid to shoot bomb), shooting cardboard villains (avoid shooting cardboard civilians), shooting own color targets (avoid shooting opposing players color), protecting the iconic Dr.Don and Dr. Dan, and many miscellaneous challenges such as the Galaxian stage where lightgun is used in place of spaceships to shoot aliens. The stages are presented in groups of 4 and the player or players can choose in which order to play them. You lose a life-heart when you shoot an incorrect target or bomb, or when you fail to complete a mission within the time limit. As well as converting the arcade game in its entirety, this conversion also offers a new Quest mode, a Party Play system and more.</story>

    <story>Doukyu Billiard Master (known as Pool Hustelr outside Japan)- You&apos;re a hustler, baby. Weaseling your way from underground pool halls to even seedier settings, the objective is to play the best game of pool possible while wagering high amounts of cash. But no matter how good you think you are, there&apos;s always someone better than you...or is there? Pool Hustler will give you the opportunity to find out! Pool Hustler features several gameplay options including the Lesson, Story, Two-Player, Practice, and Trick Shot modes. Outlined somewhat in the first paragraph, the Story mode features a city map with six different pool halls. Players will go around to the various halls, make wagers, and try to beat one of 12 different pool champions. Just be careful not to bite off more you can chew -- you&apos;ll be left with an empty wallet and the game will be over. Your opponents range from hustler wannabes to actual pool sharks; the short tempered Joseph acts as a stepping stone for victory while Morgan learned to play a mean game of pool during a 35-year prison sentence. Each player has his or her own unique style and grasp on the fundamentals of pool theory, so watch yourself! The Lesson and Practice modes are great for new players; while the former teaches players the mechanics of pool via tutorial sequences, the Practice mode is there for practicing trick shots and angles. It even allows you to place balls on a table in any manor you desire! When you&apos;ve got the necessary skills to take on your pool shark friends, challenge them to a Two-Player duel! Players can select between four different games including Nine Ball, Eight Ball, Rotation, and 14.1 Continuous. Finally, the Trick Shot mode features 30 unique trick shots for the player to master! Players are required to play in accordance to strict, but realistic rulings. For example, if you sink the cue ball or fail to hit the lowest numbered ball in Nine Ball, you&apos;ll be fouled. If you&apos;re playing by professional rules only, three fouls result in automatic disqualification. Additionally, general rules are followed such as lagging for break, calling shots, and break options. So get out there and show them who&apos;s the real Pool Hustler! </story>

Once a sport is selected, players can elect to play a Tournament Game or Last Man Standing. Tournament consists of a series of ten increasingly difficult multiple-choice questions worth 100, 200, or 300 points apiece. Players who continually answer correctly after buzzing in will receive a streak multiplier in addition to points, but an incorrect answer deducts points from their total score. The person with the most points at the end of the game wins, receiving an overall ranking as well as a possible Hall of Fame induction after achieving a high score. Last Man Standing follows the same structure but with a finite number of allowable misses, the default being five. Once this number is reached, the next player in line continues until only one remains. Both trivia contests conclude with a gold, silver, and bronze medal ceremony based on overall points. High scores, rankings, and question progress (from the pool of 4,000) are then saved to memory card. </story>

    <story>Power Rangers- Lightspeed Rescue for PlayStation is one of several games based on the 2000 incarnation of the long-running TV franchise. This version lets the Power Rangers defend Mariner Bay against the minions of the evil Queen Bansheera in a 3D beat&apos;em up. The game consists of six regular plus one hidden level, with such featured environments as an office building, a dam, the top of a moving train and more. Players can select from the five different Lightspeed Rangers, who each have varying stats for energy, strength and speed and a unique special attack. The game uses 3D polygonal graphics with the camera emulating an isometric viewpoint. The goals in each area include rescuing hostages and beating up bad guys. Updates via comlink from Captain Mitchell and Miss Fairweather keep players posted on story developments and new goals. To defeat the various enemies, the controls allow for punches, kicks and jumps (which can be chained into combos) as well as blocks. To use a ranger&apos;s special power, the appropriate meter must be filled by picking up colored crystals. The powers include a targeted beam, a ground-shaking hit, multi-target somersaults and more. Other pick-ups besides the crystals include health refills and short-time invincibility. Each level includes various bosses with large health bars to pummel down. In some levels, the rangers need to transform into their Megazord mech form to defeat the final boss. Live-action clips from the TV show set the scene between levels and the actors from the show lend their voices to the game as well. The game features a two-player mode that allows two rangers to take on the enemies at the same time.</story>

    <story>Premier Manager 98 is a team data update of Premier Manager 97. All 92 teams from the nationwide leagues and international teams were updated for the 1997-98 season, keeping all the features from the previous title (online English league database, 3D match engine) untouched. Although only the English league is available, it is still possible to play in pre-season friendlies or international competitions against most first division teams in Europe and South America or scout and sign their players. There are two game modes- Manager and Pro-Manager. Manager allows the player to start in any team. Pro-Manager, on the other hand, requires the player to build his career from the Conference, promoting the club from the lower divisions or getting promoted himself to better ranked teams. It&apos;s possible to tweak options such as the level of control (trainer leaves the player only in control of player tactics and squad selection, accountant is the exact opposite, giving the player control over transfers, contracts, staff, finance, board room options and ground expansions, but no limited control over the squad, Manager gives control in all but contract deals and total gives full executive control) or if players age and eventually retire, or play forever. Up to 20 players can play in Manager mode, 8 in Pro-Manager.</story>

    <story>Unlike the data update that is PM98, Ninety Nine (the actual title of the game) uses Dinamics&apos; PC Fútbol 6 engine to go along the obligatory 1998-99 squad updates. Among the new features, it is now possible to make more than one player bid at the same time, more frequent and detailed staff messages, player history to track down previous seasons, a full 3D match engine and a 2D radar view (replacing the old text mode) and finally merchandising and catering, and individual adboard management. The detailed database is still there, and so are the Manager and Pro-Manager modes. Only the English leagues are playable still and Kevin Keegan, Fulham and then soon-to-be England manager, endorsed the title. The manager modes and options remain the same- Manager allows the player to start in any team, Pro-Manager requires building a career from the Conference, promoting the club from the lower divisions or getting promoted himself to better ranked teams. The difficulty level can be further tweaked by changing areas where the staff takes control, and you can determince if players age and retire with time. Again, up to 20 players can play in Manager mode and 8 in Pro-Manager.</story>

    <story>Backgammon is a board game for two players in which the playing pieces[1] are moved according to the roll of dice. A player wins by removing all of his checkers from the board. There are many variants of backgammon, most of which share common traits. Backgammon is a member of the tables family, one of the oldest classes of board games in the world. Although luck plays an important role, there is a large scope for strategy. With each roll of the dice a player must choose from numerous options for moving his checkers and anticipate possible counter-moves by the opponent. Players may raise the stakes during the game. There is an established repertory of common tactics and occurrences. The objective is to remove (bear off) all of one&apos;s own checkers from the board before one&apos;s opponent can do the same. The checkers are scattered at first and may be blocked or hit by the opponent. As the playing time for each individual game is short, it is often played in matches, where victory is awarded to the first player to reach a certain number of points. </story>

    <story>This game is an innovative slant on the interactive movie. You&apos;re Eric Fox, a psychic detective who can transmit his psychic self to others, to see through their eyes and hear through their ears. That way you can find out things about the case you couldn&apos;t otherwise. The game has many different conclusions. It&apos;s a dark story though, and most people might not want to play through again.</story>

    <story>The year is 2010, and people are being born with special powerful abilities, such as the power to control the elements. These people are deemed Psychics. A large group of underground Psychics are plotting something mysterious, which may endanger everyone, and this group is called Noa. Psychic Force follows the intertwined adventures of a group of Psychics as they each struggle to reach their goal, and ultimately defeat the threat of Noa. Psychic Force is a one-on-one fighting game and battles take place in a flying, floating cube on a 2D plane. The characters use a combination of Psi powers and combat techniques, with each player having his/her own special abilities. Each Psychic character has attacks relevant to the element they control (fire, ice, thunder, wind, gravity, etc.), while Gates (the only non-Psychic character) has a built-in weapons system. Every character has two light attacks, two heavy attacks, one ultimate attack, a charge and the ability to block attacks. There is a Training mode, where players can learn and test out Psi powers, the regular Arcade mode, and a Story mode in which the main characters fulfil their quests.</story>

    <story>Psychic Force 2012, the sequel to Psychic Force, is a one-on-one fighting game with a twist. The matches take place inside a giant floating cube. You are able to fly, using your psychic abilities, around a 3D arena with six walls. Each of the ten available characters, Might, Regina, Wendy, Emilio, Setsuna, Patty, Gudeath, Genshin, Carlo, and Gates, are controlled with three buttons- guard, weak attack and strong attack. The effect varies with the distance. Next to the regular life meter, there is also a power meter. By using special moves, the meter is drained and your moves are limited. It is possible to recharge, and the capacity of the power meter expands when you lose a lot of health. Additionally, each fighter has its own unique moves, energy attacks and a weapon, which they use, mid-flight, to pummel their opponent. There are three main game modes- training, versus and a story mode using static anime-inspired images and in-engine cut scenes to tell the story. The story centers around two groups of psychics with differing ideals about co-existence with humans. In the middle of this are several neutral psychics with ties to members in either group. The later PlayStation port, renamed to Psychic Force 2, adds the 3 missing characters from the first game (Genma, Brad and Sonia), the psy-expand mode where the player can play a series of special battles to learn other character attacks, and an anime intro video replacing the original in-game intro. It also lowers the overall difficulty of the CPU fighters and makes some control adjustments (for instance the shield can now optionally be enabled with a single button). Of course, the graphics were notably degraded.</story>

    <story>In the world of Puchi Carat, thieves stole the twelve gems that made the people&apos;s dreams come true. They sold them to evil sorcerers who used them to suppress the people. Now, a long time after these events, the gems came into the possession of twelve mysterious characters. Each one of them tries to get a hold of the remaining jewels to fulfill their dreams - some of them seek peace while others want to satisfy their hunger for power. Puchi Carat takes its inspiration from the video game classic Breakout. The player has to clear rows of gems with a ball launched from a cursor that can only move horizontally on the bottom of the screen. In regular intervals, the stones will move one row towards the bottom. Once they reach a line just above the cursor, the game is over. New rows of jewels also appear if the player is unable to catch the ball and it bounces off the floor on the very bottom of the screen. The single player mode has four different variations. In trial mode, the player has to destroy a certain amount of rows to advance to the next level. Story mode pits the player against the computer in a split screen fashion. It is possible to send rows of stones to the other player in three different modes, depending on the attack pattern the player selected. The third mode is time attack- here the player competes for the fastest time destroying 50 rows of gems. The final mode is called rapid mode where the player competes for the highest number of rows they destroyed. It is also possible to play against a human opponent. In this mode, difficulty and handicaps can be selected by the players. The player who wins the most rounds is the winner of the multiplayer match.</story>

    <story>Puma Street Soccer is a 4-on-4 football game, based on Puma&apos;s own version of indoor football. The field is small, surrounded by a hip-height board players can use to bounce the ball. The rules are simple- the game starts like in basketball, with the ball being dropped between the two forwards in midfield. The rest of the game is very freeform, with fouls being awarded for awkward challenges (Penalties are given if the attacking player is on the break) and throw-ins (scored with the feet) if the ball goes above the boards. The player can select the tactics - from the three field players (the goalkeeper can&apos;t leave the goal area), it&apos;s possible to pay more offensively (with 2 in front and 1 in the back) or defensively (2 in back and 1 in front). While the real tournament was traditionally played on public parks and car lots, the game version includes these and more exotic settings, such as an airport, a ships&apos; deck or in the middle of a city crossroad. The grand finals are always played inside an indoor arena. After a team manages a number of shots, they are entitled to three supershots, which are much more powerful and swerve a lot more than regular shots. The three shots, if well used, can turn a game upside down in a matter of seconds or mean the team will have to do a lot to make up for them if spoiled. While building up the Supershot gauge, the player has to rely on well placed shots, header, volleys, bicycle kicks or moving the ball in attack very quickly to score. By winning competitions, players can unlock Puma-sponsored stars, such as JJ Okocha, Lothar Matthaus, Angelo Peruzzi or Gianluca Pagliuca and compete with them in their national teams.</story>

    <story>Punky Skunk is a side scrolling platformer where the titular skunk has to rescue his friends from a mad wolf who is threatening to take control of the world. Like in other games of its kind the player has to make his way through the levels by running left and right, jumping and using a spray attack to take out the various enemies that stand in his way. To complete a level the player has to reach a flagpole and attack it. When hit by an enemy the skunk loses one of his green orbs (which acts as hitpoints) and when all out of these a life is lost. More orbs can be earned by taking out enemies. Collectable stars can be found all around the levels and by getting a hundred of these an extra life is earned. The player will come across various extreme gears that allow him to progress through the levels. Once a gear is equipped the regular spray attack can not be used. There are six gears but only one can be equipped at a time. These include the diggers which allow the player to dig through earth in a Dig-Dug fashion, the paraglider which allows him to use air currents to his advantage, the pogo stick that allows him to jump higher, the skates which allows him to move really fast and the snowboard which allows him to gain speed on downhill slopes. There is also a jetpack that is only available towards the end of the game.</story>

    <story>In this vaguely Tetris-like game, players score points by eliminating star blocks. A star block is a colored rectangle with a star on one end of it, and blocks are eliminated when the stars of two like-colored blocks touch each other. While the game is being played, star blocks and obstacles rise from the bottom of the screen while the player moves and rotates a cursor which determines where additional star blocks will be thrown into play from off-screen. The game features single-player and competitive play as well as a story mode featuring boss creatures and a bizarre plot -- apparently the whole game is actually a sport in which children poke a creature known as a star pig with sticks in order to make it vomit star blocks.</story>

    <story>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy. There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example) The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.</story>

    <story>QIX Neo is a remake of Volfied, Taito&apos;s arcade game from 1989. The graphics and sounds were upgraded, but the basic gameplay remains the same, with the player controlling a tiny ship moving over a green contour line. The thin line is drawn over the edges of the screen, framing the game field. The ship acts as a cursor and has to be used to draw a square or rectangular extension into the field, thus removing it and slowly decreasing the size of the available space. Enemies roam each level, moving in random patterns around the screen but always following the movements of the cursor. The ship has a force-field shield around it, and only becomes vulnerable when drawing new lines. The player has to quickly close the sections, timing it correctly to avoid collision with any of the foes or their projectiles. The enemies can be eliminated by connecting a section where they are standing, or by using one of the power-ups. The power-ups are stored inside boxes, that in some levels keep appearing and disappearing, and can be collected by removing a section with one of them inside. Most of the powers are temporary, giving lasers to destroy the smaller aliens, freezing the enemies for a few seconds, increasing the speed of the ship and helping in other ways. Each level is finished after removing at least 70% of the field, or if the large boss monster that shoots at random intervals is killed in some way. A port of the original game is also included, using the old assets but with a horizontal orientation.</story>

    <story>Developed exclusively for the Sony Playstation, this fourth title in the Ridge Racer series features new visuals, powered by goraud-shaded polygons, giving each car and track a more refined appearance, while keeping the same arcade gameplay popularized by the first game of the series. While it includes the usual time attack and a new split-screen versus mode, the focus of the game is the Real Racing Roots &apos;99, Ridge City&apos;s three heat, seven race championship, with the grand finale in a speedway during New Year&apos;s Eve. The player starts by choosing one of the four teams available (from easiest to harder)- Micro Mouse Mappy, directed by the lovely Sophie Chevalier who hopes to win the first title in many years for the French team to honour her ill grandfather, Pac Racing Team, a recently created Japanese team directed by Shinji Yazaki who expects to create an immediate splash in the Ridge City racing scene, from Italy the RRR champions Racing Team Solvalou, with the demanding Enki Gilbert at the helm, and the American team Dig Racing Team, who has fallen into financial difficulties, with team director Robert Chrisman struggling to provide the driver with a car capable of out-handling opponents. After picking a team, the player can choose one of the four car makers available- Lizard and Assoluto keep the old RR tradition of cars drifting wildly on corners, but Age Solo and Terrazi offer a new experience with their Grip cars that require more breaking and careful trajectories, but are easier to control during turns. The player earns (and so, unlocks for free play) cars by completing races; however, final placement defines how good the car will be. By scraping through the first two heats (the Final GP accepts nothing but a victory), sponsors will be unwilling to invest in the team and instead of a new car, the mechanics will only upgrade the current vehicle. But winning all races allows the driver to reach the Shooting Hoops speedway with the fastest car. By combining all qualifying placements, 320 cars are waiting to be unlocked. R4 Ridge Racer Type 4 also includes an extra disk, featuring the original Ridge Racer in higher resolution. For a time, the game was also sold as a bundle along Namco&apos;s innovative Jogcon controller.</story>

    <story>One of the first few games to be released when the Playstation originally became available, The Raiden Project is actually two games on one disc. It contains almost near perfect translations (or ports) of Raiden and Raiden II from the arcade versions. Raiden is the name of the fighter/bomber that the player flies to destroy and rid mankind of the aliens that have invaded Earth in 2090. Raiden consists of eight vertical scrolling missions where the player maneuvers the Raiden craft dodging and destroying enemy robots, buildings, ground targets, and air craft. Raiden II picks up three years after the player has destroyed the first invasion of aliens. They are back, after raising another army! Raiden II is more of the same, a vertical scrolling shoot&apos;em up. It has additional weapons, new enemies and terrains. The game can be played alone against the computer hordes or another player can join along to fight simultaneously. There are several types of weapons and power-ups the player can acquire by destroying enemies that make their Raiden ships more powerful and destructive. One of the most unique and recognizable weapons from Raiden are the thermonuclear bombs. They are perfect for destroying almost everything on the screen and softening up tough end-of-level bosses. Other options abound in this arcade conversion including difficulty settings, credit limits, remixed music, on screen text positioning and the ability to save your high scores with a memory card.</story>

    <story>A chaotic, and bouncy rally racing game. One of the aspects of this game that set it aside from other games at this time was the variety of the terrain. Not only is it off-road, but the course is filled with jumps, dips, hairpins, and off camber turns. Consequently, it is very common for the car to flip upside down. By pressing the shoulder buttons, the player can rock the car left or right. To get back on the tires, the user must time the rocking of the car to flip it back upright. Any of the course can be raced forwards or backwards, and there is a season mode as well as the single race mode. In order to increase the chaos, there is a suicide-mode where you race the course in the opposite direction of the other cars. Up to 4 players can play the game in split screen mode. Tracks include a tight Stadium course, an abandoned mine, jungle, and desert. One trick to increase performance is that the buttons that rock the car upright, can also be used to prevent flipping in tight corners. Mud, dirt, snow, and water are kicked up behind the car to add some graphical flair. The cars in the game are not licensed vehicles.</story>

    <story>The sequel to the chaotic off-road rally racing game, Rally Cross. The lead programmer, Mark Lyons, and the lead artist, Scott Atkins, from Rally Cross had left Sony and formed a new company, Idol Minds. Rally Cross 2 was one of the first two games developed by Idol Minds. It was an attempt to build on the original, while creating a game with a simpler learning curve. Rally Cross 2 retains the rough terrain of the original, with even more jumps and crashes. Multi-tap and 4 player split screen were not included in the sequel, but 2 player split screen remained. The ability to control attributes such as suspension, tires, and steering was added, as well as the ability to paint your car with a primary and detail color that can be picked from a large palette. Once again the courses can be raised forwards or backwards, and in suicide mode(cars racing in opposite directions at the same time). The multi-race, season mode, still exists. One of the biggest additions is the track editor. There are a dozen or so different pieces that can be rotated and dropped into a 2D grid to create completely new tracks. The cars are still flipped upright with the shoulder buttons, but it now requires only a single button press instead of the multiple rocking motions in the original. Handling has changed significantly since cars tend to fishtail around the corners instead of flip, but high speed crashes will still result in an upside down car.</story>

    <story>Rampage World Tour is a updated version of the classic Rampage. Rampage World Tour starts off at Scumlabs International where three lab technicians, George, Lizzy, and Ralph have mutated in an accident involving toxic waste. George has turned into a gigantic ape, Lizzy a gigantic lizard or dinosaur, and Ralph some sort of gigantic wolf. The three destroy the lab they previously worked at and then embark on a path of destruction encompassing the entire globe. The player chooses one of these three characters and begins destroying buildings, eating civilians, knocking planes out of the sky, and stepping on tanks. The ultimate goal of the game is to rid the world of Scumlabs by traveling to the cities where they are located. Being creatures of such massive size, there are many cities that must be destroyed along the way. Scumlabs and the various militaries make it a priority to destroy you and optionally another player that can play simultaneously. The graphics are worth noting as they are of a unique, colorful cartoon flavor. Gameplay includes players climb buildings while punching, kicking, and eating their inhabitants to destroy them. Once all the buildings for a particular stage have been destroyed, the stage is clear and players proceed to the next stage. Players can get many different kinds of power-ups that make them more powerful or restore health.</story>

    <story>While technology may improve graphics and sound, some things never change. Rampage 2- Universal Tour is very much in tune with its history, barely deviating from the original city-stomping arcade game appearing in the 1980s. Like its predecessor, Rampage World Tour, Rampage 2 retains the original 2D worlds, but improves the graphics, completely re-rendering the characters. The premise remains the same- stomp out cities and wreck things in general. Some new features in Rampage 2 include four new characters (in addition to the original three), new attacks and combos, a power meter, and bonus rounds. The cart allows up to three people can play at once and there are plenty of new cities to destroy.</story>

All enemies you encounter are antibodies, programmed to terminate any virus. Following this virus-infiltrate-in-body theme, the levels are called Self-Area, Emotion, Consciousness, Intelligence, Memory, and Consideration, each reflecting Con-Human&apos;s details of sentience. Finally the player must fight against the Dis-Human Antibody, and Infinity, Con-Human&apos;s heart.</story>

He can also attack by throwing his fists, or winding up his fists for a more powerful punch. He can occasionally find special power ups that grant him unlimited flying power, giving him the ability to navigate through tricky mazes. Aside from the platforming action, the other notable feature of Rayman is its large, detailed and vibrant graphics, which have helped it to stand out from most other similar games in the genre.</story>

    <story>Your Dad just got you an RC Helicopter. Play with it, or take it outside to complete various missions for friends and family. The missions range from cutting the grass in your backyard, to filming ghosts. With each mission, you earn points to upgrade your helicopter, (or even get new helicopters) and unlock more missions. Just be careful; your helicopter is somewhat fragile, and has a limited battery life. RC Helicopter is a flight simulator of radio-controlled toy helicopters originally released as part of the Simple 1500 budget line in Japan. The helicopter is maneuvered with the analog sticks of the DualShock controller. The left stick controls the movement while the right stick makes the aircraft go up and down. A battery meter and a hit counter at the top right corner show the remaining energy left and the number of bumps that the helicopter can sustain. When the battery is drained or the machine received too many hits, the game is over and the mission has to be restarted. The main objective is to complete all the missions available from the city map screen. At the beginning of each one, a character asks the player to perform a specific task with the helicopter. In some cases, the toy is equipped with special tools to complete the mission, like a squirt gun and a claw that can be activated by pressing the R1 shoulder button. In the first missions, the aircraft has to be used to transport soda cans to a garbage pail, cut grass with its blades, splash birds with the water gun, blow baseballs from a roof, recover document folders from train tracks and other challenges. After completing a mission the characters give money as a reward, that can used to repair any damage to the helicopter and recharge its batteries. The mission money can also be spent on items from the RC shop. The player can purchase new helicopter models and upgrades, like a more resilient body for the machine, and more durable batteries.</story>

    <story>For years, the Toy-Volt company has been producing toys and games for children all over the world. Within months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt shot to the top! No one could put their finger on exactly what it was that made the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in the world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost.... magic. Now, their newest R/C cars really start to live! Re-Volt is a racing game where you take control over one of more than 28 R/C cars and drive on one of the 13 tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a reversed (backwards) or mirror (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from. There are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There&apos;s a Single Race, where you complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where you try to complete a series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you play with live opponents. There&apos;s also a Time Trial, where you&apos;re alone on the track, and simply try to get as best a time as possible; a Practice mode, where you&apos;re free to drive around a track to learn its structure and shortcuts; and the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect stars situated in hard-to-reach places. In Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which makes your car shock opponents nearby to make them stop.</story>

Each of the six levels features a different character whose primary goal is to rescue stranded victims. Special missions can also be attempted on each level, which may involve saving animals, dousing fires, or clearing a path for trapped people. Each rescue attempt earns players honorary badges at mission&apos;s end, but running into hazards on a level can take badges away. Ariel Flyer uses her piloting skills to save people on rooftops while avoiding lava bombs, electrical charges, and waterspouts. Rocky Cannon&apos;s mission involves using a grappling gun to hoist himself across lava flows to reach stranded people. Air Rescue Specialist floats through the air on a glider to grab people standing atop their homes, while Gil Gripper navigates the town&apos;s flooded waters using his jet ski to find potential victims. The final two missions involve Jake Justice and team leader Billy Blazes. Jake drives his motorcycle across a dangerous highway in an attempt to save construction workers. Players can jump across obstacles, such as potholes, to save the day. Billy Blazes uses his fire truck to free people trapped inside burning buildings. As players approach a person in need, they can raise the vehicle&apos;s ladder to complete the rescue. Molten Menace offers two difficulty levels as well as an option to save progress using a memory card. </story>

The game, in fact, looks more like Time Crisis, which doesn&apos;t rely on accuracy less very much, thus letting you enjoying the fast-pace of the game dynamic. On the other side, the variety in Rescue Shot is similar to the Point Blank series. The game takes place on a lot of different scenarios, full of traps to avoid and dangers to overcome- from a manufacturing industry to a tube, from a Japanese market district to a country village. The main character in the game is Bow, a dog who wanders through a fairytale-esque land where all sorts of minions try to hamper his progress. The aim of the adventure is to help Bow regain his memory after he fell off a cliff. He needs to collect all 5 dream fragments to be able to make a wish, so he can remember where he came from. Each of the 10 scenarios (grouped in 4 stages) has got its unique inhabitants (robots, birds, porcupines, bats, ...) and boss (a tiger, a wolf, a machine...). Tons of items in the background, from mushrooms to spiders and flowers (and even windows), can be shot to reveal power-ups of all sorts. Occasionally you have to shoot Bow in the derriere to get him to jump over obstacles, or a timely shot to the head will cause him to duck flying objects.</story>

    <story>Even though Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine were able to destroy the Umbrella corporation&apos;s undead monsters in the original Resident Evil, Umbrella&apos;s experiments into the T-virus continued unhindered. Claire Redfield, the younger sister of Chris, and Leon Kennedy, a rookie cop on his first day of the job, arrive in the sleepy midwestern town of Raccoon City only to find the city in flaming ruins due to the inhabitants having been transformed into mindless flesh-eating freaks. Although Claire and Leon team up, they are soon separated from each other and trapped inside the city by an accidental car crash. Barricading themselves within the Raccoon City police station, each character must find a way to escape from the nightmare while solving the mystery of what happened to Raccoon City. Each character will gain the periodic assistance of a fellow survivor... Leon will team up with a mysterious but well armed woman calling herself Ada Wong, while Claire will find herself charged with protecting a little girl named Sherry Birkin. Besides the zombie population (which is much more diverse than the original, including teen girl zombies, maniac cop zombies, and even melting naked zombies), Claire and Leon will also have to deal with a variety of freakish mutants including giant poisonous spiders, walking venus-fly-traps, and speedy wall-crawling Lickers. They will also be pursued by not one but two seemingly unstoppable foes- a horrific and constantly evolving man-monster known as the G-Type, and a taciturn but inhumanly powerful Umbrella agent who is nonetheless saddled with the rather quaint name of Mr. X . Like the previous game in the series, Resident Evil 2 is a 3D action-adventure using three-dimensional polygon characters over two-dimensional pre-rendered backgrounds, with the action viewed through a variety of cinematic fixed camera angles in each room. Just like the original Resident Evil, players can choose to play as one of two possible characters. Each character goes through the same initial scenario, but with differences in the type of weaponry they find and the people they meet along the way. Unlike the original Resident Evil, beating the game for the first time unlocks a second scenario to be played with the character you didn&apos;t choose, with all new locations, maps, enemies, and a longer more climactic ending. Your actions in the first scenario can also affect the outcome of certain events in the second scenario. Additionally ammo and healing items are more plentiful than in the original game, although you still aren&apos;t given enough bullets to kill every enemy you meet.</story>

Each character will gain the periodic assistance of a fellow survivor... Leon will team up with a mysterious but well armed woman calling herself Ada Wong, while Claire will find herself charged with protecting a little girl named Sherry Birkin. Besides the zombie population (which is much more diverse than the original, including teen girl zombies, maniac cop zombies, and even melting naked zombies), Claire and Leon will also have to deal with a variety of freakish mutants including giant poisonous spiders, walking venus-fly-traps, and speedy wall-crawling Lickers. They will also be pursued by not one but two seemingly unstoppable foes- a horrific and constantly evolving man-monster known as the G-Type, and a taciturn but inhumanly powerful Umbrella agent who is nonetheless saddled with the rather quaint name of Mr. X . Like the previous game in the series, Resident Evil 2 is a 3D action-adventure using three-dimensional polygon characters over two-dimensional pre-rendered backgrounds, with the action viewed through a variety of cinematic fixed camera angles in each room. Just like the original Resident Evil, players can choose to play as one of two possible characters. Each character goes through the same initial scenario, but with differences in the type of weaponry they find and the people they meet along the way. Unlike the original Resident Evil, beating the game for the first time unlocks a second scenario to be played with the character you didn&apos;t choose, with all new locations, maps, enemies, and a longer more climactic ending. Your actions in the first scenario can also affect the outcome of certain events in the second scenario. Additionally ammo and healing items are more plentiful than in the original game, although you still aren&apos;t given enough bullets to kill every enemy you meet.</story>

    <story>So Evil they even gave it a subtitle! The final installment of the Resident Evil series for the Playstation, Resident Evil 3 takes place during the events of Resident Evil 2. The midwestern town of Raccoon City is in ruins, having been overrun with the undead creating T-virus thanks to the wacky hijinks of William Birkin and Umbrella Inc. As Jill master of unlocking Valentine (one of the two main protagonists of the original Resident Evil), you must find a way out of the zombie-infested remains of the city alive. Along the way, you&apos;ll interact with and receive help from three heavily armed Umbrella mercenaries who have also become stranded in Raccoon City thanks to the incompetence of their employer. Standing in the way of your group&apos;s last escape are a horde of flesh-eating zombified citizens, homicidal mutants, and a relentless killing machine known only as Nemesis who is determined to hunt down and kill the survivors of the original Resident Evil, including Jill. A dramatic improvement over Tyrant/Mr. X/G from the previous games, Nemesis possesses the same maneuverability as Jill allowing him to run (faster than you, in fact), use firearms (such as a rocket launcher), dodge attacks, and even move through doors and from room to room in pursuit of Jill. On top of that he still possesses the nigh indestructibility we&apos;ve come to know and... well, know from Umbrella&apos;s ultimate bio-weapons. Like its two predecessors Resident Evil 3 is a third-person action-adventure game with polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds with cinematic camera angles, a technique originally pioneered by Alone in the Dark. Although the game uses the same basic engine and gameplay as the previous games, improvements include auto-targeting, a 180 degree spin, and a new dodge move that allows you to avoid enemy attacks by pressing a button a second before they strike. Another addition is Jill&apos;s ability to create different kinds of ammunition by mixing together three different types of gunpowder found throughout the game. Compared to Resident Evil 2, the amount of available ammunition and healing items has been significantly decreased, making the game more difficult. The variety of zombie citizens has also been made more diverse. The number of polygons in the character models has also been increased, along with the possible screen resolution and color depth for the PC version (up to 1600 X 1200 at 32 bits, from a maximum of 640 X 480 at 16 bits for Resident Evil 2). Another welcome addition in the PC version is the ability to skip cutscenes as well as the door loading animation. The PC and Dreamcast versions includes all eight of Jill&apos;s possible costumes, as well as the mercenary mini-game Operation Mad Jackal which allows you to play as one of the three Umbrella soldiers. On the Playstation version, these special features must be unlocked by beating the game with a high score.</story>

    <story>In this game, you control Cornet, a young orphaned girl who can animate lifeless puppets playing on her trumpet. One day, Cornet meets prince Ferdinand and falls in love with him. She joins a contest, the winner of which will have the privilege to marry the prince. But in the middle of the contest, an evil sorceress bursts in and kidnaps the prince. Now Cornet and her friends must defeat the sorceress and rescue the prince. The game is in a certain way a parody on typical save-the-princess RPG stories, because here you are almost a princess yourself, and it is the prince who requires saving. Instead of FMVs the game uses musical performances to advance the story of the game, which makes it a kind of game-musical. The battles are turn-based and remind those of strategy RPGs- you move around the battle field, and your attack should be in a proper range to hit the enemy.</story>

Neo Kobe is shown as a futuristic city in a style that greatly resembles Blade Runner, in the same manner as in Snatcher. I presume that the building shown in that image, and in one below is a conception of the Konami Omni Building where Junker HQ is located. The game is based on the arcade machine (ZR107 Hardware) of the same name released by Konami in 1995 that features a vehicle cabinet. The playstation game features 8 different vehicles to choose and different circuits. Includes a Speed King Neo Kobe 2045 pin. </story>

    <story>This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other Road Rashers who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you- you can either do your best to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place. There are five circuits to race- The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup. There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class. If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game&apos;s Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie- you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place. The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game&apos;s options menu.</story>

    <story>Roadsters is a car racing game that features both licensed cars from manufacturers like Mitsubishi, Alfa Romeo, Lotus, etc., and unlicensed cars from imaginary manufacturers that are based and bare great resemblance to their equivalent, real car models. The game has 8 racers and 34 cars from which you can choose from and 4 modes in total- 1. Roadster Trophy – The player starts by selecting one of the available racers and is given a sum of money that must be used to acquire a car. There are 3 divisions in which the player can compete on with the 3rd being of the easiest difficulty and requiring less money to participate; the 1st being the most difficult one and needing a higher amount of money in order to participate. More money can be earned by winning the races and that in turn allows to buy new cars or upgrade the ones that are already in possession. Multi-Player – Multi-player mode supports up to 2 human players that can compete in any of the available circuits with 4 more CPU controlled racers. The mode allows for either vertical or horizontal split screen. Quick Race – In Quick Race the player can select the racer, car, circuit and weather conditions, and race against 7 more CPU controlled players. Time Trial – Like Quick Race mode, the player can also select here the racer, car, circuit and weather conditions but without the competition of the other modes, the player races against time for as many laps as the player wants.</story>

    <story>Robin Hood (christened Robert) is a heroic outlaw in English folklore who was born in approximately 1290. A highly skilled archer and swordsman, he is known for robbing from the rich and giving to the poor, assisted by a group of fellow outlaws known as his Merry Men. Traditionally Robin Hood and his men are depicted wearing Lincoln green clothes. The origin of the legend is claimed by some to have stemmed from actual outlaws, or from ballads or tales of outlaws. Robin Hood became a popular folk figure starting in medieval times continuing through modern literature, films, and television. In the earliest sources Robin Hood is a commoner, but he was often later portrayed as an aristocrat wrongfully dispossessed of his lands and made into an outlaw by an unscrupulous sheriff. The books often had political-cultural undertones, championing Anglo-Saxons as heroes and the Normans (whose conquest of England began in 1066) as unjust tyrants. Light gun shooter, also called light gun game or simply gun game, is a video game genre in which the primary design element is aiming and shooting with a gun-shaped controller. Light gun shooters revolve around the protagonist shooting targets, either antagonists or inanimate objects. Robin Hood the Siege is a gun game in the style of games like Operation Wolf series based on the famous character, the game was published only in Europe in the year 2004 by Phoenix Games. </story>

    <story>Robo Pit is an arena fighter, plain and simple. Well, maybe not so simple. When you start your game, you have to build your mechanical gladiator; choosing the color, body, eyes and legs. While most of your starting choices are purely cosmetic, the legs you choose do slightly affect your game by changing the speed and mobility of your fighter, as well as its special attack. Once you&apos;ve created your robotic brawler, it&apos;s time to start climbing the ranks. To progress, you have to fight the robot that&apos;s occupying the rank above yours. Once you beat them, you get to take an arm and then move up. The game continues on in this fashion until you&apos;ve bested all of the other combatants. However, a few curve-balls are thrown your way as you climb the ladder. For starters, there are several different arms you can acquire; from swords and shields to cannons and lasers, and the more you use them, the faster and more effective (i.e. damaging) they are. On top of that, even so often a sort of boss robot is put in your way. These bosses use special weapons that only they have access to. Until you pound them into scrap and take them, that is. These weapons can be incredibly powerful if you stick with them, making the rest of the fighters, save number one, a breeze. As an added bonus, you can even save your cyber-combatant to a memory card and bring it to a friend&apos;s house for some one-on-one let&apos;s-see-who-has-the-best-robot fighting goodness! The arenas themselves are fairly basic, but they are varied, offering up different layout and obstacles to take cover behind or use to get the drop on your opponent. They also have ledges, and like most fighting games a ring-out means an instant loss. As for the fighting, it&apos;s simple, but effective. Square and circle attack with the left and right arms, X jumps and triangle triggers your special (which has to charge of course). Of course different weapons have different ranges and timing, which will also improve the more you use them.</story>

    <story>Robo-Pit 2 is, like its predecessor, a fighting game where robots battle it out in an arena. The game starts with the player creating his own robot. The player can use 146 different parts and 72 colours to create a robot of his own taste. The different body parts that can be customized are head, body, arms and legs. Each body part has its own attack and durability ratings that determines how the robot will fare in combat. The battles takes place in the Coliseum. The Coliseum consists of a number of rooms each hosting an enemy robot that the player has to defeat to unlock more rooms. Defeating an enemy can also grant the player new body parts as well as experience and skill points. The player can move around his robot from a third person perspective and launch different attacks such as jabs, straight, hook and upper attacks. With good timing it&apos;s also possible to link attacks together. A special attack can be executed when the SP gauge is full. There&apos;s also a guard impact command which allows the player to repel the enemy attack. The player has a booster which allows the robot to fly as long as the boost gauge lasts. A battle ends when one of the combatants has his energy reduced to zero.</story>

    <story>Roswell Conspiracies- Aliens, Myths &amp; Legends is a game based on the animated TV series of the same name, basically X-Files for kids. The player takes the role of Nick Logan who has the unique ability to see through alien disguises and accompanies him during his work- catching aliens to save the world. The gameplay principle is simple- the player walks through 15 levels with a fixed camera perspective and shoots everything he sees, e.g. werewolves or vampires. To do this he uses one of the many weapons he finds - all of them have unlimited ammo but have to regenerate energy during pauses of fire. But the player doesn&apos;t kill his enemies for good- He has to catch them with his alien trap (which is a matter of pressing one button) or they regenerate. Besides the shooting the game also features its share of puzzles, e.g. activating a mechanism, and bosses. There is also a mini game which comes into place whenever Logan has to disable a bomb or open a lock- basically a series of quick time events where the player has to press the correct button with the right timing. The levels are divided into five areas- London, Ireland, San Francisco, a Maya temple and Roswell.</story>

    <story>Rox is a classically styled puzzle game which is at first look very reminiscent of Tetris, Dr. Mario, or Sega&apos;s Columns. The puzzle pieces in Rox are standard (six-sided) dice. Dice of different number values fall from the top of the screen for the player to arrange in place before they hit the bottom. One die must be matched with another of the same number value, aligned so that an additional number of dice equal to that number value are between the two matching die. The game becomes faster and more challenging as the player progresses. </story>

Three modes of play have you competing against yourself, a friend, or the computer. Arcade involves weaving down each course, trying to reach various checkpoints before time expires.

Travel across the globe to compete in Africa, Europe, America, Asia, and Japan. Choose one of four 3D characters and their equipment for each event. Kayaks, snowboards, and bikes are all individually rated in speed, handling, and grip, so you&apos;ll be able to select a model that suits your playing style before racing. Proud of the way you thrashed the opposition? Records for each course are saved to memory card along with names. Rushdown also features Dual Shock Analog Controller support, instant replays, 13 music tracks from six French bands, and an option to play a friend on either a horizontally or vertically split screen. </story>

    <story>The sequel to Saga Frontier, but also to the less known SNES Romancing SaGa series, Saga Frontier 2 allows you to play the stories of two main characters - a young prince Gustave XIII, who has been exiled from his homeland because he was unable to use the mysterious power of Anima and to become a worthy successor to the throne, and William Knights, a treasure hunter, who strives to find ancient artefacts containing great powers. Their stories are connected to each other, and each story occupies almost a lifetime- the characters grow up and die, new characters are born, etc. Saga Frontier 2 continues the non-linear gameplay traditions of the SaGa series. You can visit all towns at your wish and at any time, recruit anyone to your party, and freely upgrade your party members by gaining new abilities and distributing them among your characters. You can learn magic spells by collecting artefacts, and combining them to produce more powerful types of magic. Similar to Konami&apos;s Suikoden series, there are three types of combat- one-on-one (duel), turn-based party combat, and strategic army battles.</story>

    <story>Saiyuki- Journey West is loosely based on one of the four classical novels of Chinese literature, Journey to the West (Chinese- Xi You Ji) by the 16th century writer Wu Cheng&apos;en. This tactical RPG lets the players take the role of the novel&apos;s hero who is also a historical character, the 7th century scholar and Buddhist monk Xuanzang (Japanese pronunciation- Sanzo) and his monster companions, including the famous monkey Sun Wukong (Japanese pronunciation- Son Goku), as they travel to India. The game takes quite a few liberties with the original tale, including allowing the player to change Xuanzang&apos;s gender, giving each monster a more powerful were- form, and tying each character, save Xuanzang&apos;s, to an elemental affinity. The real meat of the game is the tactical battles, where careful unit placement and use of each monster&apos;s unique special abilities determine the outcome of the battle.</story>

The possessed swordsman has brutally slaughtered innocents in his path, yet could not raise his blade to the cries of an innocent baby. Vowing never to spill innocent blood again, he targets those who live by the way of the sword...but now the hunter becomes the hunted- 1. Amakusa, Shiro Tokisada - The orb wielding Boss from Samurai Shodown I is now a contender in the race against Zankuro, his next religious sacrifice for enlightenment. 2. Basara, Kubikiri - The embodiment of hate has risen Basara the Executioner from his grave for revenge against Zankuro for murdering his lover (and himself). Love is stronger than death. 3. Gaira, Kafuin - A Buddhist monk with giant prayer beads as his weapon. He had an argument with his grandfather, the great Nicotine and was kicked out from the monastery. Wandering aimlessly, he witnesses the demon Zankuro spill innocent blood. The monk vows to teach the demon a thing or two on the teachings of Buddha...the hard way. 4. Galford and Poppy - The American Ninja and his beloved dog seeks to defeat the demon Zankuro in the quest for justice for the deaths of refugees killed by Zankuro. 5. Genjuro, Kibagami - Former colleague of Haohmaru, now rival. Genjuro the Assassin almost killed Haohmaru in a match for a scroll that would increase one&apos;s fighting skill, but instead got expelled from his fighting school. Flamed with vengeance, now he&apos;s has his sword aimed at Haohmaru&apos;s heart...history will not repeat itself. 6. Haohmaru - Learns from a boy that a demon killed his parents, out of compassion Haohmaru takes the task to avenge the boy of his parents. 7. Hanzo, Hattori - Darkness never sets in the eyes of the Ninja Hanzo and death is its only release. The stench of death by the demon Zankuro only draws him nearer, to what may be his ultimate release. 8. Kyoshiro, Senryo - The famed Kabuki artist searches out his next dramatic play by defeating the demon Zankuro for his next best-selling kabuki play! 9. Nakoruru - Sensing a disturbance in Mother Nature, Nakoruru with the help of Shikuruu the wolf and Mamahaha the falcon seeks out the demon Zankuro. 10. Rimururu - Nakoruru&apos;s ice-wielding sister. Determined to protect her sister at all costs feels instead that the disturbance in nature is caused by Amakusa. 11. Shizumaru, Hisame - A boy with an umbrella searching for his past. Remembers only the never-ending screams of his parents being murdered by a vile demon...maybe this is the demon he&apos;s been searching all this time at long last... 12. Ukyo, Tachibana - The blue-haired master swordsman finds his sensei and students dead. He learns that the demon Zankuro is responsible and heads off for revenge. The female fans still await him from a distance... The third series of Samurai Shodown introduces 2 different techniques for each character. The Slash techniques are the original moves of the most of the characters whereas the Bust techniques maybe the darker version of each character.</story>

    <story>Razor Racing, the follow-up to Razor Freestyle Scooter, brings the popular sport into the realm of race competition. Combining speed with elements from the previous title, players take their scooters and hit one of three locales in an attempt to become a racing legend. Each location (city streets, mall, and an industrial compound) is composed of three separate sections. In the first round, players qualify for the race by completing three laps within the allotted time. Next, players race by challenging two other opponents in a three-lap challenge. Completing these two objectives will open up the area&apos;s skatepark, and by beating the park&apos;s overall score, a new member will be added to the racing team. Three teams are available to choose from, each composed of four members hailing from different parts of the city. One character from each team is selectable at the start, with the other three unlocked as the game progresses. Players can also shoot for X-Points by achieving high scores within the levels. If all X-Points are collected, players will earn an X-Medal. </story>

    <story>Enter a surreal world where you must battle the Sentinel and his sentries over 650 chequered, 3D landscapes. Energy and movement are completely redefined in this unique blend of arcade and strategy elements. You, only known as an intelligent presence, move about the landscape by teleporting between robot hulls. Any object in your field of vision can be absorbed for energy, as long as you also see the square of the landscape that the object is standing on. By aiming at any square your can see, and spending energy, you can create a new robot hull and teleport your presence to it, or you can create neutral objects- trees to block yourself from the Sentinel&apos;s gaze, or boulders that can be stacked. You gain height in the landscape by creating a robot on top of a stack of boulders, until you can see the Sentinel&apos;s square at the highest point in the landscape and absorb him. The problem is that the Sentinel slowly rotates and ruthlessly absorbs anything in his field of vision that is more potent than a tree, including yourself. In later levels, his sentries will threaten you with absorption from several directions.</story>

    <story>Sesame Street- Elmo&apos;s Number Journey is an educational 3D action-adventure that is designed to help children ages three to six with number recognition and basic addition and subtraction. This game is brought to you by Children&apos;s Television Workshop, the same company responsible for the PBS television series Sesame Street, the developer Realtime Associates Inc. and published by NewKidCo LLC. It was released almost simultaneously with Sesame Street- Elmo&apos;s Letter Adventure, also for the PlayStation, as well as two similar titles for the Nintendo 64 platform. In Sesame Street- Elmo&apos;s Number Journey you assume the role of the cuddly red Muppet Elmo as you journey and explore three different fantasy worlds. These worlds are Cookie Monster&apos;s World, Count Von Count&apos;s Castle and Ernie&apos;s Carnival in the Park. You will begin your adventure on Sesame Street, where you will meet Sesame Street characters who invite you to visit their fantasy worlds to search for numbers and play games. Before you leave Sesame Street you can interact with the characters around you as well as visit Elmo&apos;s Room, where you can practice playing the game. While in Elmo&apos;s Room you can also view the game&apos;s credits and watch preview videos from Sony Wonder (by pressing the down directional button). Each of the three fantasy worlds you will travel to consist of two different game environments and a bonus world. Once you have acquired the correct amount of numbers required to pass through each fantasy world you will be instantly transported to the bonus world where you will be challenged to solve simple addition and subtraction problems. Throughout the game you will receive both verbal guidance from Sesame Street characters as well as the guidance of a special onscreen controller that will prompt you on what buttons on the controller need to be used. Sesame Street- Elmo&apos;s Number Journey does not require the use of a memory card. The game&apos;s three levels of difficulty (Easy, Medium and Hard) can be accessed and changed at any time while playing</story>

    <story>Shadow Tower is first-person dungeon crawler from the team that created the King&apos;s Field series. Though the two games share a similar style, theme, and look, Shadow Tower is the start of a new series unrelated to King&apos;s Field. The player controls mercenary Ruus Hardy, who, upon visiting the town of Zeptar, finds it razed to the ground. The towns inhabitants have been killed, and their souls claimed by evil spirits lurking below a nearby tower. Ruus heads alone into the underground dungeon to slay the monsters and set the souls free. This journey will take the player through six worlds based on nature, including Earth, Fire, Illusion, and Death, and pit them against monsters and bosses alike. Players control Ruus from a first-person perspective, swinging swords and casting spells accordingly. Players can strafe with the left and right shoulder buttons. Weapons and armor are found around the dungeon and equipped from the status screen. Rings can be found that are imbued with a predetermined set of magic spells. The player can have one ring on each hand, and one spell active for each ring. Players can buy and sell items at shops. Equipment can wear out with repeated use, and must be repaired by a blacksmith or replaced all together. There are no experience levels in Shadow Tower. Instead, the player builds stats by repeating related actions. Players can find fixed warp and save stones within the world to travel and preserve their progress. There are no maps, either in-game or included with the documentation, so the player must make their own with the help of an in-game compass. The game supports multiplayer only through a limited 2-player battle mode.</story>

    <story>Shanghai- True Valor is a 3D puzzler based on the classic Oriental games Mah Jong and Shanghai. Each game starts off with a stack of tiles arranged in a pyramid shape. In order to win, the player is required to match up tiles by finding free tiles of the same type. For instance, some tiles have numbers and some have pictures; the object is to find a tile not restricted, blocked, or under another tile. Once a player matches up two tiles of the same type, they are removed and the pyramid is reduced. By removing tiles, previously restricted tiles may be opened up. Gameplay flows in this fashion until there are no more tiles or a stalemate. Stalemates are very common and occur when there are no possible matches or moves remaining. Shanghai features two game modes, Classic and Arcade with an option for two-player split screen action. In the Classic mode, the traditional tile game is played from a 3D viewpoint. To get a better view of the free or restricted tiles, the camera can be rotated around the pyramid. The Arcade mode is a bit different in that it features game modifications. Going up against the computer AI or a second player, you choose a character and pick a variation of the classic game, such as playing with four sets of tiles on a rotating cube. The two-player head-to-head feature involves removing tiles and finding power-ups, like Tetrisphere for the Nintendo 64. The game features an online rules listing that can be accessed any time from the menu system. Additionally, players can customize time limits and the tile sets from the options screen. Shanghai- True Valor also supports the PlayStation Mouse for better control of the cursor. </story>

    <story>Shoot is a budget compilation of 7 action mini games. These are- 1. Wild West 2. War Drones 3. Space Rebellion 4. G Squad 5. IF22 6. Ace 7. Air Rescue Though listed as 7 different games, in fact the games are mostly reskinned versions of each other. They all feature the same premise- Take down a certain number of enemies to advance to the next stage. Each game has its own main menu, although it only features three options- New Game, High Score, and Main Menu (which takes you back to the game selection screen). Wild West and Ace (while graphically different) has the player assume the role of a single character in the foreground seen from behind. The Mission (as in all games on the disc) is to kill a certain number of bad guys per stage to advance. The character can walk sideways or roll, and the game utilizes a Cabal style aiming system. Meaning that you move the aim as well as the character with the directional pad. There are also a few bonuses such as heavier weapons and bonus points to pick up. G Squad has the player pilot a big mech robot. The only freedom of movement is strafing sideways to the left or right and some slight movement up and down. Aside from that the player controls the aim and can select from three different weapons to take down enemies with. There are also bonuses, such as ammo, extra points and fuel. War Drones, Space Rebellion, IF22 and Air Rescue are all variants of the same theme. The player controls an airborne machine (airplane, jetfighter, mecha or spaceship, depending on the game), and takes down enemies in a similar fashion to the arcade classic Afterburner. There are two types of weapons to use- either a light rapid firing weapon (machine gun or laser, depending on the game) and rockets which are somewhat heat seeking. There are some bonuses, such as more ammo, extra points and fuel to pick up along the way.</story>

    <story>In this game based on characters and settings from the computer-animated film Shrek, players control the titular ogre on a quest to find ten missing picnic items stolen by the Three Blind Mice. The result is an adventure through ten different locales linked together by the swamp. Players guide Shrek from a third-person perspective as they avoid mischievous swamp critters trying to stun them. Each area contains a mini-game that will reveal one of the lost picnic items once completed. The catch? Shrek must first collect a specific number of items to gain access to the mini-game. Once he finds the items, which range in type from pumpkins to candy, Shrek will be able to compete in an assortment of activities. Tug of War has players pressing the directional pad to move a casket, while Cotton Candy has the ogre swinging his confection in the air to trap six flies. Catch Some Weed Rats involves stomping on ten vermin, and Collect the Armor is a race to gather seven pieces of armor while avoiding the Dragon. Swamp Fishing has players reeling in four fish, while Catch the Three Blind Mice is another pattern matching game. Catch the Worms involves grabbing ten squiggling annelids, Cross the Rope Bridge consists of jumping over gaps while avoiding fireballs, Knights&apos; Stand has players tossing tomatoes to score ten points, and Swing on Chains has the ogre moving from one chain to the next until he reaches the exit. Once players complete each of the ten activities, Shrek and Princess Fiona will finally be able to have their picnic. Two difficulty levels are available, Easy and Hard, with the latter causing Shrek to lose items each time he is hit by a swamp critter. Progress during the hunt can be saved to a memory card. </story>

The town’s decline has started with a disastrous earthquake, but it may also be caused by an Indian curse, because the mine was built on land sacred to the Skaedi tribe. You play the part of a bounty hunter who has been hired by the people of Silverload to find one of their children. The parents claim that it is kidnapped by the monsters of Silverload. If you survive long enough, you will discover the town’s dreadful secret. Silverload is a 3rd POV, inventory-based point and click adventure that belongs to the genre of horror adventures. It includes a few arcade sequences- from time to time the player will become involved in gun fights. Silverload was originally developed for the Sony PlayStation.</story>

    <story>In Skydiving Extreme you try to maneuver your team of skydivers into different formations in an odd mix of skydiving simulation and rhythm gameplay. You can practice your moves or compete against another player or computer. When beginning a game, your chosen team of four skydivers will jump and then you have a limited time to complete more four-person formations than your opponent. Doing a correct formation will slow your descent, giving you more time to execute more tricks. To perform a formation correctly you must correctly enter the button sequence displayed on the screen within a short period of time. If you do this correctly your four skydivers will move into the formation. Formations are performed in sequence; if you miss one you must return to the beginning of the sequence and start over. You try to do as many tricks as possible before your team falls too low and they must pull their parachutes. You can also &amp;quot;attack&amp;quot; your opponent - by performing tricks successfully you fill up your attack meter. When it is full you can execute an attack and force the other team to defend itself by performing a defensive formation. If the other team fails in its defense, it will fall at a higher rate of speed.</story>

    <story>Soccer &apos;97 is a one or two player football game based on the English league as it more or less was in the 1997-1998 season. There are four modes of play•Exhibition mode where the player picks both teams and plays as one of them. •League mode where a player selects a team and plays through an entire season with the game simulating all other results. The teams in this mode are restricted to the English Premier league for the 1997-1998 season ( see note below) •Arcade mode is a knock-out tournament •Tournament mode starts with four groups each with four teams in each which can be manually or randomly populated. Here the teams within each group play each other and the group winners play for the trophy. There is a limited team management function within the game. Prior to the match the player can decide on their preferred formation, and can assign roles such as man marking to their defenders and so on. The game is licensed by the Professional Footballer&apos;s Association and so can use footballer&apos;s names, however all team emblems and strips are fictitious. The teams available in the Exhibition Match mode are Arsenal, Aston Villa, Birmingham City, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Chelsea, Coventry City, Crystal Palace, Derby County, Everton, Huddersfield Town, Ipswich Town, Leeds United, Leicester City, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Middlesbrough, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest, Queens Park Rangers, Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday, Southampton, Stoke city, Sunderland, Tottenham Hotspur, Tranmere Rovers, West Bromwich Albion, West Ham United, Wimbledon and Wolves. However the teams in the League are not quite those that played in the 1997-1998 season. The league is largely correct but Bolton Wanderers and Crystal Palace are missing and have been replaced with Middlesborough and Sunderland.</story>

Sonic Wings Special is an enhanced and expanded port of Aero Fighters Special (Sonic Wings Limited in Japan), a coin-op shoot-&apos;em-up with vertical scrolling. The original coin-op game uses altered levels, graphics and many features from Aero Fighters, Aero Fighters 2 and Aero Fighters 3. The home console version adds new characters and endings, new bosses, updated graphics and unlockable planes. There are also Time Attack and 2-player modes. The game uses a branching stage system, so it is impossible to see all levels in one sitting. There is a total of 14 playable characters and many different endings (some of which are reused from previous games in the series). Overall the game has a comic feel. As of Summer 2012, the Android version of Sonic Wings Special has only 4 playable characters with 4 endings and 9 stages.

    <story>In Sorcerer&apos;s Maze (known as Prism Land in Europe) you play as Prism and Rhythm (a cat and a fairy) who set out to save the seven trapped guardians of the land. Gameplay is very similar to Breakout or Arkanoid. Players control a moving paddle (a tail-swinging kitty in this case) to bounce balls and break gems lined along the upper area of the play field. There are ten worlds with ten levels in each. Worlds include air, seas, rivers, forests, and castles, which primarily just changes the background art. Players are granted score multipliers for hitting gems in quick succession, and lose a life if the ball falls past the paddle and off the screen. The end of each world is a boss battle, where the player must bounce the ball off the boss&apos; weak spot while avoiding attacks. Two players can also team up, or challenge each other in split-screen Battle Mode. In addition to points, the player builds up MP through smashing gems and collecting items that fall out. In addition to collecting and activating powerups during play, the player uses MP to purchase powerups at the start of each level. Powerups include multiball, piercing ball, wider paddle, and a comically enormous ball. Graphical effects are used during the boss battles, and with some powerups, to generate snow, stretch the screen, and otherwise bring life to the play fields. High scores are saved, but progress within the worlds is not. However, the first level of each of the ten worlds is always available at the start. After having saved all the guardians, you unlock the final castle stage.</story>

By defeating enemies, the invisible RPG elements are introduced- you have hit points, energy points, and you can collect weapons and items. When an enemy approaches, this is shown through an icon, along with the distance. The environment is claustrophobic and maze-like, and includes many enemies.

    <story>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to the Tank. The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier. Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion. And none too soon, because the Invaders are back! Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision. (See Battlezone and Asteroids.) But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari. The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies. You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels. You&apos;ll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth. There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones. You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row. As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots. Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you&apos;ll face a unique boss. If you manage to finish the game, you&apos;ll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</story>

    <story>Based on the movie of the same name, Space Jam centres around an invasion of Looney Tunes land by tiny aliens. The fate of the Tunes is to be decided by a basketball game, and for this the aliens turn into the huge, evil Monstars. The game is about two thirds basketball sim and then minigames are stuck in to fill all the gaps. You can play as the Monstars or the Looney Tunes who have the help of Michael Jordan. The basketball games themselves come in two flavours, two-on-two and three-on-three. Successful completion of the minigames upgrades your character&apos;s abilities on the court. There are several - one involves finding MJ&apos;s basketball togs, one is a space race in the style of the retro Micro Machines games. There are about five minigames in all, and a player from both teams participates. The multiplayer is a big aspect of the game. There is the traditional two-player versus, one team Tunes, one team Monstars, and there is also co-operative mode. In this two or even three players can play on the same team. Using multitaps, you can actually have a three-on-three game. The Tunes roster is made up of Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola Bunny, Taz, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepé Le Pew, Sylvester, Wile E. Coyote, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam. The Monstars have access to Pound, Bupkus, Bang, Blanko and Nawt. There are three statistics in the game, namely Speed, Shooting and Rebounds. These are pretty self-explanatory, but there is another more subtle one that&apos;s similar to stamina. Throughout the course of play your characters will get tired and lose their focus. A successful slam dunk usually tops this up. The closest thing the game has to a single player mode is the Intergalactic Tournament (though it can be played multiplayer). This is a series of five matches in a row. One captain is picked and plays every game, while the rest of the team is substituted in and out. There is no real way to progress in the game as it does not support memory cards. Space Jam has more of an arcade, lighthearted feel to it.</story>

    <story>Ace fighter pilots Cyber, Nigo, and Wells have been sent on a mission by the Republic Special Forces to destroy a secret weapon before it is completed. Between missions the three pilots will chat about the status of the mission as well as other topics in FMV cutscenes. The player&apos;s craft is equipped with two Vulcan guns. Two additional Vulcan guns are attached to FANG extensions, which operate similarly to the options of the Gradius games. Additionally the ship can fire a very powerful Over Drive beam or turn invulnerable and dash through enemies and bullets with the Booster. Both can be used to start a bonus chain counter to earn additional points, and both also increase the Over Drive Gauge which will cause the ship to overheat and lose functionality if filled. Unlike most scrolling shooter games the player&apos;s ship can withstand several hits before it is destroyed.</story>

    <story>Spawn- The Eternal is a video game for PlayStation based on Todd McFarlane&apos;s Spawn comics. The game switches back and forth between two styles of play. There&apos;s an exploration mode, which is along the lines of Tomb Raider. Spawn must climb and jump his way through a variety of environmental obstacles while smashing crates and furniture to find power-ups. When you approach an enemy, however, the engine switches into something between a 3D fighting game and an old-fashioned side-scrolling beat-em-up. Spawn must defeat one or more enemies, who may be surrounding him before he can continue.</story>

At the beginning of each mission, you choose a two-man team from a group of six rangers. Each has different qualities (a sniper, a gunner, a grenadier), so you need to compose a team fit for the specific task, with more than 10 weapons available. Singleplayer mode permits the player to control the ranger and his buddy at the same time. Two-player offers cooperative split-screen play. The emphasis is on tactical play, although there&apos;s plenty of action.</story>

    <story>Stealth Patrol is the first console adaptation of the long-running PC military Spec Ops series. Players command two rangers on a variety of missions. Instead of working with a squad like the PC versions, only two rangers can be controlled. This can be done by two human players working together. When there is only one player, the computer AI takes over the second ranger, but the player can switch between them at any time. Also different in this console adaptation is the change of gameplay perspective from first-person to third-person. Before starting a mission, players select the ranger best suited to complete objectives, based on five classes- machine gunner, grenadier, rifleman, close quarters specialist, or sniper. Each class has different abilities, and access to specific weapons or items. Each type also has a certain encumbrance, but the equipment can be further customized based on the available options. Some of the included weapons are shotguns, grenades, tripwire mines, machine guns and sniper rifles, but also more general items such as nightvision goggles. The missions are set in a forest in Siberia, snowy mountains in Bosnia, the desert in Iraq, mountains in North Korea, and the jungle in Vietnam. The radar is an important element during gameplay. When a ranger is shot at, the enemy position briefly lights up on the radar as a red dot. Killed enemies often leave behind medkits and additional item pick-ups such as ammunition.</story>

    <story>Speed Racer is an English adaptation name of the Japanese manga and anime, Mach Go Go Go which centered on automobile racing. Mach GoGoGo was originally serialized in print form in Shueisha&apos;s 1958 Shonen Book, and was released in tankobon book form by Sun Wide Comics, re-released in Japan by Fusosha. . Based on the popular cartoon, Speed Racer joins the plethora of racing games available for the PlayStation. As Speed Racer himself, you can race on three different tracks simply titled S, M and L for small, medium and large. Before beginning a race you must choose between three slight variations of Speed Racer&apos;s famous white Mach 5, one of which has manual transmission. Each of the three cars is equipped with special features such as grip tires, rotary saws, a periscope, a deflector and auto jacks. Other options include 18 different soundtracks, normal and endurance racing modes and the ability to increase the speed and efficiency of your opponents. CHARACTERS- Speed Racer / Go Mifune - The focus character of both the anime and the manga is Speed Racer, originally Go Mifune.[8] He is known for his love of racing and values his family. He drives the Mach 5 (as well as other cars, such as the Mach 6 in the movie) and always manages to wind up in extreme danger (such as encountering thugs, race fixers, gangs, etc.) with his younger brother or his girlfriend Trixie. Speed is shown to miss his older brother, Rex (secretly disguised as the Racer X) in both versions. Spritle / Kurio Mifune and Chim-Chim - Speed Racer has a younger brother named Spritle, originally Kurio Mifune (????? Mifune Kurio?) and Chispita in the Latin American version who, along with his pet chimpanzee, who responded to the name of Chim-Chim in the American Trixie /Michi Shimura )- Trixie is Speed&apos;s chaste girlfriend. The M adorning Trixie&apos;s blouse stands for Michi. Michi would often fly around in a helicopter during a race, advising Speed Racer via a radio link to the Mach 5, in effect acting as his spotter, a function she also serves in the live-action film during the Casa Cristo 5000. I Pops Racer / Daisuke Mifune - Speed&apos;s father, Pops, originally Daisuke Mifune (???? Mifune Daisuke?) is a former wrestler-turned race car owner and builder.[8] Reluctantly quitting his job after feuding with a member of a corporate car manufacturing company who disapproved of the construction of a new engine for the Mach 5, he founded his own company, Mifune Motors (In the series&apos; Americanization, the company was changed to Racer Motors). </story>

    <story>Spider-Man is the first 3D game to star the popular web-slinger. It is loosely based on Spider-Man- The Animated Series and Spider-Man Unlimited and features some of the voice cast from each and similar character designs. Peter Parker is attending a demonstration of the reformed Dr. Otto Octavius&apos;s new invention when an imposter Spider-Man steals the device. Spider-Man must work to clear his name and uncover the sinister motives behind the device&apos;s theft. This game features appearances not only by most major Spider-Man characters, but cameos by numerous other characters from the Marvel Universe, such as the Human Torch, Punisher, Daredevil and Captain America. Spider-Man&apos;s webs are greatly emphasized. He can use them both for navigational purposes, like swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive combat, such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web for extra oomph, or building a protective shield. His web supply is limited though and he must find new cartridges or risk running out. The wall-crawling powers are also prominently features. Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling. This is used for basic environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many sequences where you crawl over the heads of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and catch them off-guard. Combat is based around Spider-Man&apos;s ability to jump, kick, punch and web. By combining these with direction and in various combinations, Spider-Man is able to throw objects such as furniture, hurl web balls, yank enemies into melee range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things. There are a number of boss-battles as well, all of which are puzzle-based. Missions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door types to races to catch some or evade them or just trying to avoid the police. There are several side goals in addition the main mission including multiple unlockable Spider-Man costumes and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.</story>

Superbike World Championship is the international superbike championship, and national superbike championships are held in many countries as well, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, and Canada. Superbike racing is very popular with manufacturers, since it helps promote and sell their product, as captured by the slogan Win on Sunday; Sell on Monday. Sports Superbike 2 lets players experience motorbike racing on 15 tracks against up to 20 computer-controlled opponents or compete against another human via split screen action. In Single Race mode, players select from Unlicensed, License A, or License B difficulty settings, with novice, amateur, or professional assistance (braking and steering). Initially, only unlicensed racing is available and the others are unlocked by taking and passing skill tests. Race lengths include three, five, or ten laps, or a full 100 kilometers. Races in inclement weather are not available in novice mode, and many tracks are unlocked only after completing Championship mode at various difficulty settings. The Workshop allows customization of the various motorbikes, including gearbox (automatic or manual), gear ratios (21 different sprocket sets), and tires (hard or soft). Races feature qualifying laps and vibration options when using a Dualshock analog controller. Championship mode initially allows racing only for the Tundra Trophy in unlicensed mode, with success leading to the Mexican Rally and Countryside Challenge. Completing the challenges in unlicensed mode opens access to more tracks in other game modes, with additional tracks earned by completing License A and License B skill tests. Both Single Race and Championship modes are also available in two-player competition, with the former allowing simultaneous head-to-head horizontal split-screen racing (no computer-controlled competitors). Championship mode is identical to the single-player mode, though players compete against each other for the various trophies. Secret codes found during gameplay open a variety of hidden options. </story>

    <story>Like the original Spyro the Dragon, this is a platform-adventure game. Whilst using a portal to travel to the coast, he is enlisted to help a professor defeat Ripto the dinosaur. The game is split into 3 worlds - on each of these Spyro must collect all the gems and then kill a boss. Level layouts are less linear and more expansive than many platform games, with lots of sub-quests - exploration is required. This time around, the fantasy 3D worlds are larger and more complex. Though most of the gameplay elements from the original game have remained, more puzzle elements and bonus levels have been added to this chapter. Spyro has a new ground-pounding move.</story>

    <story>The evil Gnasty Gnorc has turned all the dragons in the Dragon Lands into crystal. He has also stolen the dragons&apos; gems by locking them up in chests or turning them into soldiers for his army. But he forgot about one little dragon- Spyro. Now Spyro has to travel through the dragon kingdom and free all the dragons from their crystal prison, recover the dragons&apos; gems and defeat Gnasty Gnorc. Spyro the Dragon is a 3D platform game similar to Super Mario 64. The game consists of six worlds- Artisans, Peace Keepers, Magic Crafters, Beast Makers, Dream Weavers and finally Gnasty&apos;s World. Each world consists of a home or hub area, three regular levels, one flight level and one boss level. The goal of the game is to beat Gnasty Gnorc by working your way through all six worlds. Along the way you have to find all 80 dragons, collect all 12 dragon eggs and collect as many gems as you can. Gems are found scattered throughout the levels, in treasure chests. Also, each defeated bad guy yields a gem and end bosses hold several gems. The inventory screen shows progress for each level, how many gems found and how many dragons, it also shows many there are in each level. The real challenge lies in completing every level 100%. To do this you really have to explore every nook and cranny, the last gems are usually located on hard to reach places.</story>

    <story>3037. FedNet is now in control of the federation, and at an attempt to gain trust of the population following decades of corruption and warfare, the FedNet Space Corps were sent to the outermost planets to crush the small-time warlords still running the show there. After being convinced to join them in a tour of duty, he is assigned to an elite flight group with the only purpose of testing the most cutting edge technology. A remake of the original game of the same title released a few years before for the Acorn Archimedes platform, Starfighter 3000 features more detailed graphics (now all surfaces are texture-mapped and a fogging filter reduces clipping). Featuring 15 levels in 4 worlds, the player controls the Predator Mark-IV, a fighter ship capable of space and atmospheric flight. However, other than the handy boost button, the player has no control over the throttle, (unless he uses a flight stick with thrust controls such as 3DO&apos;s CH Pro stick) and must keep moving at all times. In post 3DO releases, only two points of view are available- behind (better for acrobatics and general flying) and cockpit (accurate aiming and NOE flight). The 3DO release contained several more, like a TV style fly-by-cam, weapon cameras, and enemy cams that could show a nearby enemies&apos; POV. By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet. One of the defining features of the game is using the laser (basic weapon) to terraform the map. As the game map is composed by tiles, some with higher or lower vertexes, can be leveled by simply firing repeatedly at the same area. This allows players to strategically avoid heavy defense turrets by simply collapsing a hill, or destroy an heavier turret by simply burrowing the ground beneath it. The player starts the game with three lives, and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game over, but as there isn&apos;t a profile for each pilot (like in Tie Fighter), the game can be resumed freely from the last savegame. </story>

    <story>Star Ixiom is a remake of the classic 1985 game Star Luster. You play the role of a pilot for The United Galaxy Space Force, fighting alien invaders with the help of the strategic mobile battle unit Team Gaia. Five alien races have launched a collective attack to curb mankind&apos;s expansion. You and Team Gaia rush to defend the colonies... Star Ixiom takes elements of other previous Namco space epics, Starblade and Galaxian 3, but places them in a free-form universe, strategically mapped.Gameplay mixes the first person space combat, strategic planning and some aspects of the role playing genre. There are three game modes, TRAINING, COMMAND, and CONQUEST. Training mode is,well, training. In Command mode you go out on separate missions where you systematically fight through one alien race at a time. In Conquest mode you are given a large randomly created map of a solar system that shows the location of your enemies and friendly objects such as planets and laboratories that you must defend.</story>

    <story>Dark Forces marks LucasArts&apos; first attempt to enter the First Person Shooter market. Instead of licensing the Doom engine, like many competitors, LucasArts created its own internal Jedi engine. The Jedi engine contains advanced features over similar tech, including the ability to look up and down, jump, crouch, and limited support (in the build used for Dark Forces) for rooms (sectors) over rooms. 3D models also make occasional appearances inside the game, as turrets or Kyle&apos;s ship dropping him off or picking him up from each mission. The player takes control of Kyle Katarn; an Imperial officer turned mercenary, now hired by the Rebel Alliance. After a prologue mission where he steals the Death Star plans from a remote facility, he is tasked with investigating the sudden destruction of a hidden Rebel base. This leads him to face off against Imperial General Rom Mohc and the various iterations of his Dark Troopers - cybernetic soldiers with the armor and firepower to turn the tide of the war. Dark Forces features 14 substantial levels as Kyle works to disarm the Dark Trooper project. Many levels reference characters or areas from the Star Wars trilogy, such as a visit with Jabba the Hutt, a trip to Coruscant, and a battle through the interior of a Star Destroyer. Every level has objectives for Kyle to complete (rare, for First Person Shooters of the period), ranging from grabbing a clue and getting out alive, to planting charges around a facility to demolish it. Cutscenes appear between key missions to update the plot. The Star Wars license gets plenty of use, and the game features Imperial officers, stormtroopers, and a collection of aliens seen in the films as enemies. Blaster rifles and thermal detonators are used as weapons, along with other firearms inspired by the tech of the films. Dark Forces also uses the iMuse engine to dynamically change the music during action scenes, with much of the music based off, or directly replicating, John Williams&apos; original film score. Dark Forces is entirely a single-player campaign, and no multiplayer is included or supported.</story>

Learning of the threat, Luke Skywalker and crew face her directly in a number of locales from the various worlds visited in the original trilogy. Each warrior starts off fighting bare handed, but has a weapon that they can draw and use, ranging from Leia&apos;s staff to Han&apos;s blaster, to Luke&apos;s lightsaber. A typical fighting game, it features arcade, survival, team, practice, and versus modes. Combat takes place on square arenas, and ring-outs are possible. The backgrounds teem with images from the original Star Wars trilogy, from snowspeeders fighting walkers on Hoth to Endor Shuttle Pad from Return of the Jedi.The control scheme is also typical, and most of the powerful moves involve fairly complex combination of buttons.</story>

    <story>Sanvein is a fast-paced top down shooter where time is of the essence and every moment counts. The main computer of the self-sufficient space colony Utopia, called St. Schutz, has gone haywire. The goal of the game is to escape from Utopia. The game plays very differently from a normal space shooter. Each floor is made up of a series of interconnected rooms, and the player can choose any room adjacent to one they&apos;ve cleared. For each adjacent room the player has cleared, their firepower in that room will be greater. Each floor has a number of boss rooms with a much larger and more dangerous enemy, each of which must be cleared to complete the floor. There is also a stronger power weapon which will recharge after use. All the while, a strict timer is counting down. When the player gets hit, instead of dying or taking damage, they lose time on the timer. The only way to get more time is to defeat a boss, so the player must balance between clearing rooms for greater firepower, and clearing bosses for more time. The game has a unique glitch-futuristic art style and five floors to play through. There are three ships and three weaponry systems to choose from.</story>

    <story>Street Fighter- The Movie is a 2D beat &apos;em up game based on the movie of the same name, which in turn is based on the well known Capcom series, Street Fighter. Using digitized animation based on the actors and the many locations featured in the film, the same style of gameplay found in Street Fighter II and Super Street Fighter II Turbo is used here. Select from a range of fighters (including Ryu, Ken, Guile, M. Bison and Chun Li) each with their own set of special moves, and defeat all of the opposition to become the King of Street Fighting. Also included is a story mode which follows the story of the movie and uses FMV in-between fights and a Trial Battle Mode, where you take on Guile in a range of different battle events to test your skills.</story>

    <story>It&apos;s Street Fighter as you always remember it, with some new moves, characters and combo systems, as well as a more polished look and feel. The new moves available for each fighter, called Super moves, allow them to fire off very powerful moves. A bar at the bottom of the screen represents the power that you have to use for the moves. You start the first round on 0, and each attack that you make adds power to the bar. Once you reach level 3, you can unleash the special attacks, that can sometimes KO the opponant. The other major change over the Street Fighter 2 series are the Alpha counters. These can be used to counter an on-coming attack after blocking.</story>

    <story>Another Street Fighter sequel (this time for Street Fighter Alpha) adds even more to the classic fighting series. New characters in this version include Gen (a wise kung-fu master), Rolento (who you may remember from another Capcom classic, Final Fight) and Sakura, a young school girl who follows her hero Ryu so close, she has the same type of moves. Dhalsim and Zangief also return to the fight with some news moves. The other major difference is the loss of chain-combos and the gain of a custom combo system. Once you reach the required level (which is 1 at the least) you can execute a custom combo by combining any of the buttons (which there are 6 in total) or any of the special attacks (fireballs, etc.)</story>

    <story>Street Fighter Alpha 3, the third game in the Alpha series, has a total of 31 fighters, the most in the series so far. New characters include old favorites E. Honda, Blanka, Vega, Cammy, T. Hawk, Dee Jay, Juni and Juli. Some of the newest fighters on the block include a former Final Fight character (Cody, who has been in jail since the last Final Fight game, or so his clothing suggests), Karin Kanzuki and Rainbow Mika. The major difference between this Alpha and the last two are the new play modes World Tour, Arcade, VS, Training and Entry. World Tour - Simply choose your fighter and travel around the world, fighting the home town heroes that you run into. The more fights you win, the stronger you fighter becomes. You can also learn new moves, and there are three levels of Super moves to choose from before you start each round (called Isms). Arcade - A simple conversion of the arcade version. Beat each fighter with your chosen warrior, in three rounds per match (much the same as past versions of Street Fighter) Versus - Two human players battle it out. Training - A good way to learn all the super moves that are available, against a dummy. Entry - If you save your character during the World Tour mode, you can upload him here to use in the other modes in the game (especially handy for Training). Finally, if you complete certain areas of the game three new fighters become available, including another old favourite in Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma.</story>

    <story>Street Fighter Collection 2 is the second title in the Collection series and it goes even further back to the classic days of Street Fighter II. Included is the one that started it all, Street Fighter II- The World Warrior, and the two improved editions, Champion Edition and Hyper Fighting, known as Dash and Dash Turbo in Japan respectively. Street Fighter II- The World Warrior features all the basic features that would be carried over to subsequent Street Fighter II editions. The original game features eight selectable characters, with Ryu and Ken being the only characters with identical moves. In the single-player tournament, the player faces the other seven main characters, before proceeding to the final four opponents, which are non-selectable boss characters. Matches can go up to ten rounds if there is no clear winner before making the player lose by default (in Champion Edition and onward, this is reduced to four rounds). The most significant change to Street Fighter II- Champion Edition is the ability to play as the four boss characters, as well as allowing two players to select the same fighter, with one character being distinguished from the other with an alternate color scheme. Characters using their alternate color scheme have their names printed in blue below their lifebar. The number of opponents in the single-player mode is increased to twelve due to the addition of clone matches. Some of the artwork is redrawn as well and the stages&apos; backgrounds are recolored. Much of the gameplay is revised to balance the characters out. Finally, Street Fighter II- Hyper Fighting is a minor update released in response to the proliferation of modified bootlegs of Champion Edition. Released on December 1992 (eight months after Champion Edition), Hyper Fighting increases the game speed and adds new special techniques for some of the fighters such as Dhalsim&apos;s Yoga Teleport and Chun-Li&apos;s Kikoken. All of the characters receive new color schemes, with the new scheme becoming the default and the original color scheme as the alternate for all characters except M. Bison, who still uses his original color scheme as the default and the new scheme as the alternate.</story>

    <story>Strider is a modern reinterpretation of Capcom&apos;s arcade classic Strider, with some gameplay elements borrowed from the NES version. The player takes control of Strider Hiryû, a ninja-like warrior sent to the technologically advanced Kazakh City. Kazakh has been taken over by a ruthless dictator, Grandmaster Meio, and his armies of robots. Many other Striders were sent before Hiryû, never to be seen again. It&apos;s now up to Hiryu to succeed where his predecessors have failed and free the people of Kazakh City from Meio and his henchmen. As the original, Strider is mostly an action/platform game where Hiryû must hack and slash his way through hordes of enemies. The player must use Hiryû&apos;s climbing abilities to explore the 2.5D environments, uncovering bonuses and upgrades in the process. By progressing through the story and defeating the many bosses, Hiryû unlocks new weapons and powers, allowing him to reach new areas of Kazakh City. Contrary to his predecessors, this version of Strider is not linear and adopts a semi-open structure in the vein of the Metroid games, although a map and navigation system always indicate in which direction is the next objective.</story>

The game features a number of improvements over the original. The graphics have been improved by making use of 2D animations placed on 3D backgrounds. Strider now has a range of new moves including a double jump, backward somersault and dash, which allows him to perform longer jumps. He also has the ability to boost his weapon, the Cypher sword, enabling it to release homing plasma waves. There is also a Savage Slash attack, with random slashes. There are numerous bonuses that can be collected in the levels. These either boost Striders vitality, increase the power of his sword or increase your game score. A welcome addition to the game is a Boss Gauge which lets you know how much energy the mid- or end of level boss has left before it dies.</story>

    <story>European soccer game based around the UEFA license. Effectively a merger between Rage software&apos;s Striker franchise and playstation/dreamcast evolution with Infogrames&apos; UEFA license. UEFA Striker offered a mix of arcade and simulation style gameplay and a certification mode, where the player was tested for skills in order to unlock game modes. The game featured many clubs from around the world in some form or another, but in it&apos;s primary game tournament mode was focused around European clubs. In addition to simple and quick selection of a &apos;friendly match&apos; the game supported the following tournaments- Super Trophy - Featuring up to 32 teams drawn from a pool of over 40 of the most popular European teams. In round 1 the 32 teams start off in four leagues, each playing the other teams within the league twice. The top two teams from each league proceed to round two, similar to round one yet with two leagues of four teams. The top two teams play the final, a tie resolved with extra time and then penalties. National Team Qualifiers - a mode only unlocked when you reached 3/10 in certification tests. Belgium and Holland were not included in the list of 49 teams split into 9 groups in a pre-defined way. This was likely because the mode was designed to mirror the Euro 2000 competition, for which Infogrames did not own the license and so could not use the official name (the tournament was based in Holland/Belgium and they automatically qualified as a result). The player could choose to player any one of those 49 teams, one home and one away match against the other teams in the same group...the top team going to the finals. Group ties resolve by goal difference, scored then conceded. The best of out of all those teams which placed second in the groups also goes forward. The remaining eight second place enter a single knockout round, with four going through to the finals. National Team Finals - Must have certified 3/10 and succeeded in the National Team Qualifiers. The remaining 16 teams from the qualifiers (or a new selection), including Belgium and Holland are split into four groups of four, playing each group member once. The top two teams proceed to a knockout format - Quarters, Semis and Finals. Penalty shootouts settle ties. Territories Cup - Certified 5/10 unlocks this mode, basically league play around various world locations - completion of each cup unlocks the next territory. 8/10 in certification mode unlocked a bonus competition. The game also supported generic league and knockout tournament play, as well a classic matches - four preconfigured scenarios replaying historical matches. Live commentary was from Ron Atkinson and Jonathan Pearce. </story>

    <story>Loosely based on the classic medieval Chinese novel Water Margins (Shuihuzhuan) by Shi Nai&apos;an. The game is a fantasy RPG set in an imaginary universe, its main theme being political struggle. The hero of the game is the young son of Theo McDohl, a general who serves the Scarlet Moon Empire, presently controlling the land of Toran. Through a series of events the hero becomes involved in a rebellion against the Empire, led by an organization known as the Liberation Army. Will the hero find a new home there, will he be able to tear himself away from everything that has been sacred to him, including his own father? Suikoden is a console-style RPG with several unusual additions. There are three kinds of combat in the game, the most common one being the traditional turn-based party combat (players can have up to six people in their active party). Magic runes can be equipped on the player&apos;s characters which allow limited usage of offensive and healing spells. There are also army battles, where the player must control whole units of fighters, archers, magicians, etc., and one-on-one fights. The game allows the player to build and customize a castle, which serves as their home base and fortress.108 characters can be recruited in the game, a tribute to 108 Stars Of Destiny in Water Margins. Many of those characters will be available as active party members and participate in battles, while others will act as strategy advisers, or enhance the castle itself in various ways.</story>

    <story>Football Champ is an arcade-style football (soccer) video game. The game was produced by Team Dogyan developers in Japan, and originally released in the arcades by Taito Corporation in 1990. Euro Football Champ and Hat Trick Hero are versions of this game with minor variations. Super Football Champ is the Playstation conversion of Taito&apos;s classic arcade machine of the year 1995. Super Football Champ is different. It is pure arcade action that deflates the idea that all video soccer games must be a serious simulation of the sport. SFC is the type of football game that you would spend your loose change on for an hour or so in the arcades before scoffing a packet of chips on the way home. The in-game graphics are typically arcade with bulky polygon players plodding around the pitch, pushing and shoving for possession of the ball. Although they appear as a squad of numbered clones, your star player does stand out from the crowd with his individual features and hair style (not forgetting to mention the flashing &apos;Ace&apos; arrow over his head). The duration of the match may last from 2 - 18 minutes with the difficulty level ranging from easy to very hard when playing against the computer. The offside rule may be switched off for a more flowing game while extra time may include the sudden death rule for a definite outcome. There are 30 International teams to choose from with the skill set at the level of their real-life counterparts. Each player will perform to the positional strengths of their team - apart from the &apos;Ace&apos;. Super Football Champ feature four modes of play. League allows to play 3 different kind of leagues. Exhibition is a single player game against the CPU, a head to head against a mate or a cooperative partnership against the CPU. Worldwide Tournament begins with group matches before entering the quarter finals for a straight knockout. District Tournament is a straight KO competition, while the inclusion of a Penalty Competition allows practice for those sudden death situations. </story>

    <story>Super Match Soccer is an action oriented soccer simulation which has one major difference to other soccer games of its time- the pass system. Instead of the usual separate buttons for passing and shooting there are three levels of shooting intensity which depend on how long the button is pressed. Also there is no semiautomatic passing, the player has to aim himself. Aside that the match control is genre standard- button combinations result in tricks like back-heels or lobs and with the sprint button a player can run fast for a limited time. By default the player controls the player which has the ball. But a optional mode enables the player to control just one soccer player. Playing modes are cups and leagues with 24 national teams which can be altered in the editor.</story>

    <story>A Tetris-like puzzle game featuring popular characters from many Capcom games. Colored gems fall from the top of the screen in pairs, but this time lining up those of the same color is not enough. To break the gems and punish your opponent with counter gems you have to place a crash gem of the same color next to the gems. If you make a block of gems of the same color they&apos;ll fuse, forming a power gem. Breaking a power gem sends more counter gems to your opponent than breaking the same amount of gems in some other configuration. But the ultimate attack is breaking power gems in chain.</story>

In this virtual recreation of the actual sport, you&apos;re awarded points based on the quality of your run as you attempt to dominate the world circuit. Points are awarded in various areas including how long you ride the wave, the height and number of turns made in an aerial, how high the spray kicks up and how long you remain in the pipeline. Prior to each round, you will select one of many different surfboards. Because surfboards harness various strengths and weaknesses, you should pick boards based on the current oceanic location and objective. Surf Riders features two modes including the Free Play and World Challenge Cup. In the Free Play mode, you can practice skills without a time limit; this will give novice players ample time to learn control layouts and combinations. The World Challenge Cup mode is for all the marbles -- the championship. A round in this mode consists of three heats- the qualifying, semifinal and final. Each heat has four computer-controlled competitors. You must place either first or second in order to advance to the next heat. In addition to supporting the Dual Shock Analog Controller for analog controls and vibration, Surf Riders uses a memory card to save game progress. Additionally, it features a soundtrack composed of surf-rock bands including Los Straitjackets, The Aquamen and Pollo Del Mar. </story>

It includes 32 nations, going for gold in 12 events divided by 6 sports- Athletics (100m dash, 110m hurdles, hammer and javelin throw, triple jump and high jump), Aquatics (200m freestyle and 10m platform diving), Kayak K1 Slalom, Super Heavyweight Weight Lifting, Skeet Shooting and Three-man track cycling pursuit. All events feature 3D graphics with cameras that mimic the ones used in TV broadcasts. Gameplay is the usual found in games of the genre - button mashing the two power buttons is required in most events to build up strength/speed, with an additional third button setting the actions, such as jumping or throwing angle. Other events feature alternate control methods, such as Slalom (where it&apos;s possible to press certain buttons to dodge the rower between the gates if the Kayak is going to hit one or place the paddle to force into a certain direction), Diving (following a click-along sequence of keys) and Skeet (the direction keys controlling the aim, one button to start and other to shoot). Along an arcade and 8-player action, the Olympic mode gives the player the option to build their athlete from the national open trials to the Olympics. By completing training drills in the Cyber Gym, the athlete increases his athletic abilities- Citius, Altius, Fortius, as told by the Olympic Motto.

    <story>The year is 2046 and the Togusa building has been occupied by terrorists. The building is owned by a major military supplier called Machine Gear and houses some important scientists. The T.R.A.G. (Tactical Rescue Assault Group) team is sent out to resolve the situation and free the hostages, but are all caught in a trap. With only two survivors, team members Alex and Michelle, it&apos;s up to them to take out the threat themselves. Gameplay resembles the early Resident Evil games, with its 3D characters over fixed pre-rendered backdrops and combination of puzzle solving and action elements. One big difference, however, is the ability to switch between any of the characters at any given time. This feature is used to solve certain puzzles and to find different routes through the Togusa building. Throughout the game you will acquire four different allies to aid you. You never find new weapons in the game, so you need to use the characters wisely and where needed, since they all have different abilities and arms. You can also split them up in teams of two, to make things even more versatile.</story>

Chasing a wild boar, Cless discovered a strange talking tree in the forest who was pleading him for help. But as soon as it stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound of an alarm. They returned to the village and found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants murdered. Before Cless&apos; mother died in his arms, she told him this terrible massacre had something to do with the pendant she and her husband gave Cless for his birthday... what connection could there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle who lives in another town, but he doesn&apos;t realize his journey will take him to much more remote places than that! Tales of Phantasia presents a unique combat system- The battles have a lot in common with fighting games- you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an overall strategy for your allies.</story>

    <story>Tall- Infinity is an action puzzle game where the object is to build a tower by matching colored blocks. A block can be grabbed by standing on top of it and rolled in either direction. If the touching faces of two blocks share the same color when the block is released, they are matched and create more blocks for use in building the tower. There are also some blocks which have no color at all, and cannot be matched, as well as blocks with a rotating arrow on them, and can only be rolled in one direction. A block can be rolled up one level on top of another block, as long as there is open space next to it for the block to get to speed. A time limit is imposed by the borderline which creeps up the tower. The borderline moves up one level every so often, and if it reaches the lowest incomplete level of the tower, the game is over. The borderline can be slowed by quickly matching blocks and maintaining a combo. Large combos also create additional new blocks when they are completed, making them essential on the more advanced levels. There is also a puzzle mode where a preset assortment of blocks must have all of their faces cleared within a set number of steps. There are several BGM tracks and characters available.</story>

    <story>Bright primary colours and a strong cartoon style characterise this squad based third person shooter. Crates falling from the sky form the resource over which buddies fight, they are collected and returned to a stacking pad where they can be opened to reveal weapons, vehicles and other team members. The objectives vary, but central to them is collect the crates, build and arm a team of buddies and hunt down your enemies. Whilst the perspective is isometric, the world is fully modeled with physics especially visible in the vehicle control, from bikes to hover tanks, biplanes to jumpjets. Weapons special effects are also very varied, with homing missiles chasing their targets, bicycle pumps stunning and inflating, and chainguns with a recoil that sends a jumping buddy flying across the screen. Gameplay includes deathmatch games, domination and capture the flag variants and a hidden footie game (with exploding ball!). Many of the features are only unlocked after completing several levels. The multiplayer options runs up to four players in each of the different game variants, keeping to a steady 25fps with a split screen, under most conditions. AI control covers over twenty agents on a game level, all with different behaviors. Team member AI is controlled through a simple context dependent order button - select order whilst facing an enemy base and your buddies attack it, or whilst facing your base and they&apos;ll defend it. Occasional ambiguities over what the target of the order is can be resolved in &apos;binocular&apos; mode, where the perspective is moved away from the player&apos;s buddy and a reticule snaps to the subject of the order.</story>

The game consists of 16 levels and a number of bonus levels. There are three game modes- Time attack, Challenge 1 and Challenge 2. In Time Attack you compete against yourself for new personal records. At the beginning not all levels are available in this mode, they have to be unlocked by completing certain levels in Challenge 1. Challenge 2 is not available until Challenge 1 is completed. The second challenge contains all the levels from the first challenge plus some new ones. The player starts in a hub world and can drive through gateway ports to select challenges and races. During the race there are ports with colored banners and the player can drive through them to collect colored flags, similar to Buggy Boy. The available colors differ for each race and collecting certain color sequences yield different power-ups. For example collect yellow and then red for a speed boost, or red, blue, yellow to temporarily freeze opponents, or orange, green, red, purple to get a helicopter power-up allowing the player to fly for a short period.</story>

    <story>The original Tecmo Bowl was an instant hit on the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game combined simple, easy to grasp arcade action, insanely catchy music and real NFL players. Tecmo&apos;s sequel in 1991, Tecmo Super Bowl, added the NFL license and detailed statistical tracking for an entire season. It was considered by many as the best football game released for the 8-bit system. The series would continue into the 16-bit market, with three games released on both the SNES and Genesis (Tecmo Super Bowl, Tecmo Super Bowl II and Tecmo Super Bowl III). While it would face heavy competition from the Maddens and Montanas, the game still maintained a strong loyal following--a testament to its universal appeal. Tecmo Super Bowl marks its first appearance on the Playstation after success in the both the 8-bit and 16-bit console markets. While the name hasn&apos;t changed, the game has undergone several refinements--perhaps none more dramatic than the ability to change the field&apos;s perspective. Instead of a horizontal view, you can now adjust the camera to a vertical or diagonal position. Instant replay, a tournament mode, expanded playbooks and live commentary have also been added to the game, to bring it up to speed with similar PlayStation sports offerings. The hallmarks of the Tecmo series have been left unchanged- you still get both the NFL and NFLPA licenses, variable weather conditions, stat tracking, injuries, multiple schedules and an emphasis on arcade action. Don&apos;t like how your team is performing? Feel free to edit players&apos; names, abilities or trade them away! Just make sure you save enough room on your memory card--a hefty eleven blocks is needed to save your data. </story>

    <story>The last eight fighters in the Tekken tournament all have their own range of moves, something to prove, and a reason for any combat opponent to fear them. For example, Nina Williams is a trained assassin, Yoshimitsu is a robotic recreation of a ninja, and Marshall Law (spot the pun) aims to set up a fighting school to pass on his knowledge. As one of these eight figures, you must come through tough fights in a 360-degree 3D environments with texture mapped backdrops and polygon graphics . After beating your seven rivals there are two Bosses to beat. There are three difficulty levels, and fight lengths and number of rounds can be varied. Each limb&apos;s movement is controlled with a different button, making finding the right combos a matter of instinct and planning rather than experimentation. Pure martial arts inspire most of the moves. This was the first beat &apos;em up allowing you to dodge an opponent&apos;s attack, something made possible by the 3D perspective. The final slow-motion replay of the final moves allows you to see where you went right or wrong.</story>

    <story>Sequel to Tenchu, Tenchu 2 is a prequel, telling a tale of events prior to those of the previous game. Once again, you can play as Ayame or Rikimaru, two faithful and honorable ninja whose lord is a gentle man in an age of warfare. With your training nearly complete, you find yourself caught up in aiding your lord against a civil war in his own domain. All is not what it seems, however, and you&apos;ll soon realize that your greatest threat has been forged much like you. Much like its predecessor, Tenchu 2 is a 3-D third person stealth action game. You are not only rewarded for stealth, but this time around on efficiency of movement. This extra feature increases the difficulty of achieving the better items, as you not only have to be quiet, but be direct and near perfect in your steps. This time around, the stories of the two ninja (and the hidden third character) diverge greatly at places, making replay much more attractive. In addition, cutscenes using both the game engine and CGI give more story as you progress. Gone, however, is the soundtrack. In addition to the story mode, there is a mission editor, which allows you to create maps and missions to both hone your skills and share.</story>

What you have here is single-match or tournament play for up to four players with wacky characters and a few different courts to play on. You can play an obese Chinese man, for example, and compete in a Roman coliseum whose clay surface seems to affect bounce marginally. That&apos;s about it for options though. No sim, Tennis Arena serves up roughly the same level of fun as Pong did 25 years ago, albeit now with prettier graphics and the occasional super smash. The game also features special shots, with visible trails, fighter-plane-like sound effects, and higher ball speed. These must be earned however. After successfully returning the ball over the net six consecutive times, a yellow star appears under the character. You may then attempt to use the special shot, which entails lining up with the ball just right - but a failed special shot doesn&apos;t erase the stored potential. </story>

    <story>This adventure game puts the player in the shoes of Rincewind, a wizard whose sole purpose in life is to stay alive. He appears to be very good at it as well, because apparently the universe has decided to continuously challenge him. The game takes place in the humorous fantasy world created by Terry Pratchett. The world is called the Discworld, as it is actually a flat disc carried on the backs of four gigantic elephants, which themselves stand on the back of an even larger turtle. The story is loosely based on the novel Guards! Guards!. Both in the book and the game, a dragon is summoned by a group of mysterious conspirators and now terrorizes the city state of Ankh-Morpork. Being the most expendable wizard of the Unseen University, Rincewind is given the task to get rid of the beast (only in the game though; in the book, the city&apos;s nightwatch has to deal with the problem). Discworld is a classical point-and-click adventure game with a few original features. For example, Rincewind&apos;s inventory is limited to two objects, and the majority of his belongings is stored in the Luggage, an intelligent chest with dozens of little feet. Furthermore, at a certain point in the game the player gains access to a time-traveling device and has to send Rincewind to the past and back in order to solve some of the puzzles.</story>

This time twenty vehicles are available to choose from, but before you can get behind the wheel, you&apos;ll have to purchase them with credits earned from winning races. Some of the licensed vehicles include a Hummer, Dodge Ram, Jeep Wrangler, Ford Explorer, Jeep Cherokee, Range Rover, Ford F-150 and a Dodge T-Rex. The World Tour consists of five events divided by class- Hummer, Safari, SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle), Truck and Military. Each class has you competing against five similar vehicles in a series of races, where you&apos;ll need to place within the top three in order to advance to the next track. Win the class and you&apos;ll not only unlock certain courses, but move one step closer to participating in the Open Class. In order to access this final event, you&apos;ll have to place first in all five races comprising the World Tour. Notable features include Dual Shock Analog Controller support, three difficulty settings for single races, your choice of automatic or manual transmission, multiple controller configurations and memory card support to save top scores. As in the original, an alternative soundtrack will accompany you while racing, including tracks from such artists as Gravity Kills, Sevendust and Fear Factory. </story>

There several additional rooms, such as a staff room for your employees to rest, a toilet so that patients don&apos;t have to relieve themselves in the corridors, a research department to get the most advanced diagnostic and treatment technologies and a training room where consultants can teach a thing or two to rookies, making them capable doctors. The size and layout of each room can be set by the player, according to the available space. In addition to rooms, the player must provide radiators, seating for patients and drink machines. However, rooms don&apos;t run by themselves. Most diagnostic and clinics can work with regular doctors, but others like the operating theater and the research room require specialized staff while the ward, pharmacy and the fracture clinic require an attending nurse. At the same time, the hospital can&apos;t run without handymen cruising around the hospital to water up dry plants, clean up litter and vomit (after all, people go there because they are sick) and fix machines, while receptionists direct patients to the proper rooms. As levels advance, the player faces increasingly harder situations- VIP visits, emergencies, epidemics and earthquakes, which can either take a toll on reputation or on the bank account. On the other hand, as more and more equipment is required, additional plots of land are available for purchase in later maps.</story>

The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park&apos;s allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides. Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay. You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don&apos;t let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides. It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</story>

As a pilot for the Thunder Force group, it&apos;s up to you to destroy an evil alien race bent on destroying the Earth and all of its inhabitants. As in its predecessors, the gameplay is fast and furious, with more powerful weapons. All weapons now have an extra powerful blast mode, triggered by holding down the fire button. Sprites have been forfeited in favour of 2D polygons made possible by the new platform. The musical score contains a lot of techno rearrangements of old Thunder Force themes. In spite of all the changes, Thunder Force V aims to please fans of old-schoolers by not abandoning concepts and details introduced in earlier games in the series.</story>

The game comes with 3 18-hole courses- Pebble Beach Golf Links, TPC at Summerlin and TPC at Sawgrass, but also for owners of previous PGA Tour games, the game has the option both to export this courses to and import the courses from PGA Tour 96 for Windows, PGA Tour Pro, PGA Tour Gold, PGA Tour Laptop and some of the course disks into Tiger&apos;s game complete with new renderings on the brand new engine that uses a combination of 2d pre-rendered backdrops, 3d foregrounds and digitally captured golfers. The golfers include Tiger himself as well as 7 other PGA champs and an option to create a custom player. Game modes available include practice, stroke, tournament, skins, shoot-out, match play, foursomes, fourball and driving range. Multiplayer gameplay is also supported with voice and text chat and up to 4 player gameplay.</story>

His dog Snowy falls asleep and dreams about their past wild adventures. The story is based on 5 books- The Black Island, Red Rackham’s Treasure, Land of Black Gold, Explorers on the Moon, and Flight 714. TinTin and Snowy are the major characters in the game through over 20 levels with a boss at the end of each one as well as bonus games. You&apos;ll travel to varied locations such as the desert, an exotic island and even the moon. Levels feature races on a boat, plane, jeep, and underwater shark submarine as well as some standard platform gameplay. Tintin is capable of a rather broad variety of movements like- to walk, run, jump, balance himself, grip and climb. It is also possible for him- to scare away certain animals and to capture enemies using the flash of his camera, to use his fists, and to throw chloroform bottles to neutralize certain characters. Another part of the play is to collect parts of a statue of Snowy which will give access to bonus levels if these are all collected.</story>

The player moves Furball through numerous rooms looking for power cell actuators needed to activate the elevators on five floors while chased by different types of evil flying Bombats which explode if they touch him. When the Bombat Disabler Gun is found, the view changes to a stationary sniper mode and enemies can be shot with green goo. Furball can also open doors, activate levers, and take items such as codes to a treasure vault in the basement. There are different mini-games and puzzles to solve, in order to progress. Plucky and Hamton will sometimes be too frightened and run away, and must be located.</story>

    <story>Titan Wars is a 3D shooter that takes place on and near the many moons of Saturn. You are a hot-shot pilot with a troubled past. You&apos;ve been re-assigned to a new squadron aboard a Tomlinson-class carrier. There&apos;s trouble on a mining colony on the moon Janus. Your squadron is sent in to investigate, and uncover a lot more than they went looking for. Solar Eclipse plays kind of like a sequel to Total Eclipse for the 3DO. Gameplay is pure arcade-style shooter. You can view the game from a behind-the-ship perspective, or an in-cockpit perspective, but the scrolling is on rails. You can only travel in one direction. In each of the 9 missions you will find wave after wave of enemy ships, and a powerful boss ship at the end. The story in this game is told through a series of full-motion video clips. In addition to between-level scenes, FMV messages from your squad mates appear from time to time while you play the game.</story>

    <story>As another addition to the off-road racing genre, TNN Motorsports HardCore TR features over 30 unique courses and 24 souped-up hotrods and all-terrain trucks customizable to your own preferences. Tracks span various locations throughout the United States ranging from the deserts and dirt trails of Arizona and the muddy swamps of Florida to the familiar wine valley landmarks of Northern California and the deep canyons of New Mexico. Held together by a map outlining race locations, the gameplay options include an Arcade, Championship, Player, Time Trial and Test Track modes. After making various modifications to your truck, you&apos;ll want to select the Test Track in order to see whether or not those changes positively or negatively affected your vehicle. Once your truck&apos;s handling and feel is to your liking, its time for some competition! The Championship mode spans four hardcore divisions beginning in the 4x4 Amateur Class; as you improve your driving skills, you&apos;ll move onto the Hotrod Amateur, 4x4 Pro and Hotrod Pro classes. Whereas the amateur classes (only readily available seasons upon startup) are five races long, the professional brackets span 10 different tracks. Your objective is to finish each division with the most points. Points are awarded by finishing in a top position- first place awards 10 points; second gives you six; and third hands out four. If you&apos;re successful in the amateur seasons, you&apos;ll be placed into the professional season where the competition is much tougher. If you&apos;d rather not deal with points and qualifying, the Arcade mode allows you to immediately jump into the action. You&apos;ll start in a designated location and unlock different locations by finishing in first place. By doing well in all the Arcade races, you&apos;ll not only unlock the various tracks but also bonus trucks available for your choosing. The Time Trial has you in a heated competition against the clock for the ultimate lap times. TNN Motorsports Hardcore TR also features a multi-player Player mode that pits you and another human opponent in a split-screen battle. The game supports analog control for unprecedented handling, the vibration function and a memory card for saving game data and modifications. There are also weather effects such as rain, snow and foggy conditions. </story>

Cars from 8 constructors tough it out over 8 circuits of first-person high-contact racing. You can race the full championship or take on single races or time trial challenges. At this time the series required all cars to make at least one pit stop during the race. This seriously affects your driving and pitting strategy. Besides the TOCA races, each of the venues also features special racing events where all drivers race identical cars. These range from the Ford Fiesta to exotics like the AC Blower and the Lister Storm, and higher, in a format similar to American IROC races. 8 bonus track layouts are also included.</story>

    <story>Lara Croft is a Tomb Raider, an archaeologist who explores ancient sites in search of valuable artifacts. In the game, Lara Croft is hired to retrieve an artifact from a tomb in Peru, which turns out to be one of three parts of the Atlantean Scion. Soon betrayed by her employer, Lara Croft travels to Greece, Rome and Egypt to recover the other parts before this powerful device falls into the wrong hands. Tomb Raider is a 3D action/adventure game in which players control Lara Croft from a third person perspective. The camera follows Lara as she climbs, jumps, and swims through detailed environs overcoming environmental obstacles and deadly fauna. Moving through levels often involves finding spots where Lara can climb, looking for spots where Lara can use her acrobatic ability, and sliding blocks and pushing levers to solve puzzles and open passageways. Lara is armed with, now trademark, twin pistols with infinite ammunition, but she can pick up higher caliber weapons to take on deadlier human opponents. Lara also comes across restorative health packs and has a compass with which she can orient herself. Lara’s opponents include animals, gunmen, as well as primeval and supernatural beings. Careful explorers can also find secret areas and avoid traps.</story>

    <story>Tony Hawk returns with an all new line-up of skaters, an all new line-up of parks to crash through, and a whole new level of graphics. The line-up of street and vert riders include Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Steve Caballero, Rune Glifberg, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Eric Koston, Chad Muska, Bucky Lasek and Bam Margera from MTV&apos;s Jackass (and Tony Hawk, of course). The create a skater mode returns, allowing for even further levels of options for your character, like adding glasses and tatoos to changing the colour of the knee and elbow pads or even the hair. And the levels themselves that you must skate through are now more interactive, with cars and humans blocking paths and making noise as you race around to make as many points as possible. Use items around the streets or the park to jump from or over to increase your score, and pull of as many wild and wacky tricks as you can.</story>

    <story>THPS4 is the fourth game in Activision&apos;s ever popular franchise. The main feature of this game is it&apos;s redesigned career mode. When beginning a level, you have all the time in the world to skate around, perform tricks, get a feel for the level, without the hassel of any goals or time limits. When you&apos;re ready to attempt a goal, simply find a pro skater, talk to him, then receive the goal, similar to Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX. Goals are similar to the previous games, such as collect SKATE, get a certain amount of points, transfer over this and grind that. There are new goals, however, such as collecting the word COMBO while doing one big combo. Miss a trick, and goal fails. Once all regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt the Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, and is extremely hard. All the major skaters are here, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie Thomas. The levels are been expanded and are huge. Some of the levels include a college campus, a shipyard, and the infamous prison complex Alcatraz. For multiplayer, all the favorite modes are back, from Graffiti and Trick Attack to Horse and King Of The Hill. New modes include Capture The Flag and Combo Mambo. THPS4 also supports System Link play, but not XBox Live. The PlayStation 2 version offers everything from the XBox version, but also has online play, utilizing either your own network adaptor or the official one. The PS2 version also features a one level demo of Shaun Murray&apos;s Pro Wakeboarder, which is not featured on any other version of the game.</story>

    <story>In Transport Tycoon, you are in charge of a transport company starting in 1930 in the midst of The Great Depression, and your aim is to build up an empire of trains, ships, lorries, planes and helicopters, with technological evolution to be taken into account. You can play alone, or with a number of computer-controlled rivals. At the beginning of the game, you (and your rivals) have a large terrain at your disposal. The terrain includes hills, rivers, lakes, bridges, industrial facilities and a lot of small towns. It is up to you to decide how to start building your empire. The game is shown in isometric projection. An icon bar at the top of the screen allows you to bring up the map, see the stats, or construct stuff. Maybe you can begin by connecting two towns with a road, building a vehicle depot somewhere next to the road, and setting up bus stops in both towns. Now just buy a bus (initially, there are just a few models available, but more buses appear with time), set its schedule, and watch as it goes between both bus stops, taking passengers and unloading them, earning you money. You can also transport passengers by building train tracks, sea ports, or airports and then buying appropriate vehicles - trains, ferries, planes. If you set up a station next to an industrial facility (such as a factory, a power plant or a farm), you can also transport various cargo, such as coal, livestock or wood, which allows you to earn much more money than transporting passengers. Of course, you&apos;ll have to buy special lorries and train cars if you&apos;ll want to deal with these. Most businesses offer certain types of cargo and are ready to pay for transporting other cargo to them; for example, a steel mill has a lot of steel to fill your cars, and will gladly accept iron ore if you have any. Clicking on any of your vehicles brings up a small window where you can observe a live feed of what the vehicle is doing and look up its status. If anything important happens during the game (such as a particular station accepting its first vehicle), it is shown as a newspaper headline at the bottom of the screen.</story>

Each combatant has at his or her disposal a range of explosives, pits, throwing panels, and gas bombs. An enemy is significantly damaged by a single trap, but one may create a sequence of traps for a devastating amount of damage. With one of six different special agents, each a specialist in assassination and demolitions, a player may progress through a story mode consisting of several missions, a sub-boss, and a final boss.

Whenever two or more objects of the same color come into contact with each other, they disappear, and the object is to eliminate all of the colored balls and target blocks. The trick to the game is that none of the pieces can be moved directly; the player&apos;s only options are to rotate the entire playing field either left or right ninety degrees and let gravity do the rest. As a bonus, the game includes an editor which allows the player to create up to fifty additional levels to challenge friends with.</story>

Help Lammy get to her latest gig on time, and face obstacles such as flaming buildings, out-of-control airplanes, and even getting trapped in Hell. In this sequel to PaRappa The Rapper you play as Lammy, a guitarist for MilkCan - the coolest, hippest band ever! While PaRappa focused on lyrics, with each button controlling a different word; Lammy is a guitar player, so naturally, each button controls a different note on the guitar. Lammy will encounter seven different teachers on her travels to the big gig, so either follow their lessons accurately, or do even better - improvise and blow them all away with your axe. The teacher will then step away for you to go it solo for an even better performance. Lammy improves over PaRappa in a multitude of ways. Rather than just being a single player experience, you can now play the game with a friend. Any stages that you unlock can be played either co-operatively or competitively. If you don&apos;t have a friend to play co-operatively with, you can also get the computer to take on the role of your partner. After finishing the initial game, PaRappa also makes a return, allowing you to play through the game again with raps instead of Lammy&apos;s guitar.</story>

The Teknos crash land on Xsarra and decide to conquer the planet in this unholy war of flesh vs. metal. The Teknos are cybernetic conquerors who want the resources of Xsarra for themselves. The Arcanes have coexisted peacefully for thousands of years but now band together to destroy the machine invaders. Each side is compromised of seven different types of warriors for a total of 14 playable warriors. Each warrior has three separate types of moves or attacks that can be performed against their opponent. Each warrior also has a strategy skill that can be used when playing that mode of gameplay. There are two types of gameplay, Mayhem mode and Strategy Mode. Mayhem mode consists of choosing seven warriors and facing off against seven opposing warriors controlled by the computer or another player. Action is fast, furious, and different each time depending on one of the several terrains that can be chosen to fight the battles within. Random power-ups also appear to help which ever warrior can get to them first. All the warriors and environments are rendered in full 3D with the camera centering on the middle point above the two warriors. The warriors dance around each other, hurling their attacks and avoiding traps. Strategy Mode consists of a three-dimensional map where the player moves his warriors across it with the ultimate goal to destroy the opposing warriors or destroy their fortresses. When two warriors meet on the map, gameplay switches to Mayhem mode and the two warriors fight to the death with the winning one returning to the map to fight another day. To create new warriors, a special type of energy called Aur must be mined. Warriors in strategy mode can perform two types of actions. These include moving, attacking, or using their special power. There is a underlying story that is never fully developed but, is revealed as the player progresses through each of the 12 regions of the Strategy mode for both the Arcanes and Teknos. A great deal of strategy is required to win in Mayhem mode and Strategy mode. Primarily, it involves figuring out which warrior to use to destroy another. Each warrior has at least one fatal weakness when matched with the appropriate opposing warrior.</story>

    <story>Uprising X is a PlayStation-exclusive entry in Cyclone Studios&apos; series of tank simulators, combining the gameplay of real time strategy games with first-person combat. The player controls a tank named Wraith with both analog sticks, using the left one to aim and the right stick for movement. The minimal plot is developed through mission briefings and cutscenes, telling the struggle between a rebel faction against imperial forces for the dominance of planets. As one of the rebels, the player has to maneuver the tank on a battlefield, searching for suitable places to construct reinforcements buildings. After entering a piece of terrain marked with four glowing orbs, a large structure topped by a turret called The Citadel appears on a nearby spot. The player can enter it by pressing both L1 and R1 buttons, assuming the role of the turret operator. Besides handling the weapons, the player can access the build menu, from where unit factories can be erected on the surrounding terrain. Extra turrets can also be placed around the perimeter to protect the base. The structures can be recycled to be replaced with new ones. The tank is equipped with several weapons, from laser beams to guided missiles, that can be used against enemy troops. From the inside, friendly units can be summoned when available to fight alongside in battle. Infantry, tanks and aircraft can be called into action from the interface menu. A tactical map showing an overhead view of the terrain can be activated with the select button. There are three split-screen modes for two players- challenge, deathmatch and siege. The first two have the players fighting directly against each other, while the last one is more strategic, where the objective is to defend the base from incoming enemy assaults.</story>

Players can race in cities such as Los Angeles, New York or Washington DC or can take part in a race through the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone. Next to Time Trial and Single Race, the Tournament is the main event. It has been split up in three sections- Park Trial, City Trial and US Race. After completing a section, the next one is opened up. The tracks contain obstacles and jumps. Enemies will try to push other cars off the road, and the police also make an appearance. Scattered around the tracks are power-ups that repair the car, provide boost or cash. The money can be used to upgrade the car, repair it or buy boost prior to the race. After completing an entire tournament with a certain car, an alternate vehicle becomes available for that character. In the Windows version two-player duels are available over LAN or TCP/IP.

There are commands for both heavy shots and for light ones, making you choose the strength to hit and throw the ball. There are no power bars and once hit, the ball flies to the opposing side automatically. The special moves can be triggered whenever you push certain button combinations (triangle and circle, circle and cross, etc) at the right moment. If it is a defense move, for instance, you must do it in response to others attacks. There is a Tournament mode, which is the main solo entertainment (although you can also play single matches vs the AI), but this game is clearly designed around player-vs-player mode, for arcade matches against human opponents.</story>

    <story>Based on the syndicated series starring Pamela Anderson, V.I.P. for the PlayStation offers a mixture of first-person shooting action and hand-to-hand combat. The female bodyguard team led by Vallery Irons is entangled in a mob vendetta while protecting their client Dr. Kindle. After Irons and Kindle are captured, the rest of the team must advance through a series of indoor and outdoor levels to rescue them. Featured characters include ex-spy Tasha Dexter, explosives expert Nikki Franco, former boxer Quick Williams, martial arts specialist Johnny Loh, and computer hacker Kay Simmons. Fighting sequences are controlled differently than in traditional fighting games, as players perform combination attacks by inputting a series of onscreen commands. If the sequence is entered within the time frame, the character will carry out the moves and damage the enemy. Play then continues until all the enemies in a level are defeated. The shooting stages are structured in a manner similar to Lethal Enforcers or Time Crisis, with players guiding a cross-hair target on the screen to shoot down enemies. Ten mini-games are also available in between missions, offering a variety of timed puzzles to complete before advancing to the next stage. </story>

Aliens are using a virus to corrupt and possess many creatures from different worlds by opening up links between the worlds they are trying to conquer. From many of these links emerged the hives. The usual mission objectives in the game are to destroy the mutated creatures and the hives, rescue local inhabitants, while beaming up weapon upgrades along the way. Players are then awarded trophies for each world saved or if it is saved quickly. These trophies allow the player to receive new ships.</story>

    <story>Valendra is a land that had undergone civil war. The end of which had birthed the parliament and several organizations to control the balance of power. Ashley Riot is a Riskbreaker agent, an elite one man investigator, for the Valendia Knights of Peace (VKP) who is investigating some strange occurrences. A cult of religious fanatics known as Müllenkamp, and their leader Sydney Losstarot, have seized the manor of Duke Bardorba of Valendia Kingdom. The events at the manor have sent Ashley on a quest to get to the bottom of what&apos;s going on, and travel into the catacombs that lead to the destroyed, yet magical city of Leá Monde. However Ashley is not the only person interested in the city, and other factions of the government, including parliament assigned Knights of the Crimson Blade and other VKP agents are pursuing their own agenda. Combat is central to the game. The game runs in real time but when entering combat and attacking an enemy, the game is paused. A wireframe sphere showing the range of the currently selected weapon and detailed statistics on different body parts of the enemies within range. The game features a range of weapons. Each weapon can be disassembled and reassembled in workshops scattered throughout the game, attaching gems for extra power. Weapons used constantly against the same type of enemy improve in power against them. Ashley can also make use of Magic, Chain Abilities and Break Arts. Magic is broken into four groups, namely defense, combat, healing and status. Spells use up mana points and are sometimes more costly than useful. Chain Abilities allow Ashley to chain together consecutive hits against enemies. Break Arts are special skills learnt after repetitive use of a weapon type. Sacrificing some of the player&apos;s health, Break Arts can perform a high damage attack on an enemy.</story>

    <story>In preparation for Ragnarok, the final battle between the gods, Odin has commanded Lenneth the Valkyrie to descend to the lower world and gather the souls of fallen heroes to serve as soldiers in the approaching conflict. You play as Lenneth, gathering soldiers and training them to be transferred to the battlefields of the gods. The gameplay mainly consists of exploring various locations (dungeons, mansions, swamps) from a 2D perspective. Lenneth can run, jump, shoot ice crystals (useful for anything from freezing enemies to building ledges), push and pull objects to solve simple puzzles, etc. All of the enemies are on-screen and can usually be avoided, in the style of games like Chrono Cross and SaGa Frontier 2. The battle system is a mix of real-time and turn-based elements. Each of the characters (up to three can fight alongside Lenneth at a time) is assigned to one of the four main keys. The player and the enemy take turns attacking, but with the right timing, the player can execute combos that leave enemies defenseless. Long combos can result in substantial experience bonuses, although it is possible to defeat most enemies without them. The rest of the game consists of Lenneth using spiritual concentration to discover the locations of dungeons and fallen heroes, ingame-engine cutscenes that give the history of these characters, and reports about the war&apos;s progress that come at the end of each chapter. The chapter system is one of the game&apos;s most original features. Each chapter (there are about 8) is made up of a preset number of periods. Each action, such as a successful use of spiritual concentration, or entering a town/dungeon, uses a number of periods that varies with the difficulty level. When all of the periods have passed, the chapter is over. Since the player must transfer heroes to Valhalla in the course of each chapter (permanently losing them), but has only a limited amount of time to improve their statistics, the game has a sense of urgency and danger often absent from more traditional console RPGs.</story>

    <story>Vampire Hunter D for the PlayStation is based on the anime titled Vampire Hunter D- Bloodlust. That anime is based on the novel title Vampire Hunter D- Demon Deathchase written by Hideyuki Kikuchi. You play as D, the half-human / half-vampire whose sole mission in life is to hunt down and kill vampires. The setting is not the distant medieval past, nor is it the mid-19th century, instead D&apos;s adventures are set in the far distant future, when humanity has nearly killed itself off by endless wars. Rising from the scorched earth and assuming power in this desolate era are the timeless vampires. They established a feudal system where they ruled over humans as nobles in Europe ruled over their peasants. But after thousands of years the Vampires&apos; power waned and humans revolted against their lords, and thus the class of Vampire Hunters were born. In this particular story, D is employed by a rich family to retrieve their daughter from the vampire who kidnapped her. He is not the only one trying to free her; a rival group of vampire hunters, the Marcus Brothers, are after the daughter and the bounty, regarding D as a rival. The Vampire Hunter D must enter Castle Chaith, battle the Vampire Lord, the minions that inhabit the castle, and a hidden evil, to save the girl and collect his bounty. The action in Vampire Hunter D plays like the early Resident Evil games for the PlayStation. There are pre-rendered backgrounds and all the characters are animated in 3D. Players utilize D&apos;s signature weapon, his massive long sword, as well as his special vampire powers, (which comprise healing, offensive, and defensive powers), to battle the hordes of evil creatures that live in the hallways and chambers of the daemonic Castle Chaith. You must solve puzzles, unlock doors, and retrieve key items to progress into the depths and heights of the castle, ultimately reaching and revealing the true evil power pulling the strings of this macabre story.</story>

You fly aboard your state-of-the-art Vanark fighter in a fixed path on several missions controlling your guns and missiles and trying to defeat all the waves of enemy ships and creatures that try to come at you. Every now and then you also get to play free-flight stages in deep space where you have full control of your ship, turning the game into a more traditional 3rd-person space sim. Additionally, between each stage you get to roam freely aboard your carrier ship using 3D characters over pre-rendered backgrounds. In these sequences you&apos;ll get to chat with fellow pilots and move the plot along, which includes triggering cut-scenes as well solving mini-games such as disarming a saboteur&apos;s bomb and other similar activities.</story>

The combat takes place in a series 3D grid based maps and each character in the party has a certain amount of movements they can perform each turn. As the game progresses, other characters join and leave the party and as they increase in level they can progress along different paths of development. Between each battle there is a cut scene that develops the plot using the same 3D engine as the combat (and often the same areas). In between battles you have the opportunity to talk to people in cities as well as purchase different equipment for the up coming battles.</story>

    <story>Vandal Hearts II is a turn based strategic RPG which is comparable to the more famous Fire Emblem series. Most of the gameplay consists of moving your party on 3D grid based maps in a way that will give you a strategic advantage over your enemies. The main difference between Vandal Hearts II and its predecessor is the change of the battle system. Unlike in Vandal Hearts you and your enemies issue the commands at the same time and then move simultaneously. That results in in completely new strategies and gives the game a unique touch. The story takes place in the already collapsed church state of Nirvadia, that was once formed by the religious leader St Nirvath, but eventually ceased to exist, because of several conflicts between unbelievers and local rulers. Caused by a chain of coincidences, the young boy Joshua, from a small and unimportant village in the east, eventually finds himself within a complex political scheme set in motion by power-hungry aristocrats and religious fanatics.</story>

What&apos;s more, there are loads of computer controlled cars that are there simply to slow you down. The standard racing game modes are here- Tournament, Time Trial, and Single Race. One unique feature, however, is the stunt competition. You can compete in a series of events that test various driving skills in timed events. Some example events are the long jump and the slalom. The selection of cars is quite diverse. You can race vehicles that range from low performance, like a VW Microbus, to high performance, like a Dodge Viper.</story>

    <story>Vegas Casino is a game for up to four players via multitap comprising Baccarat, Roulette, Let It Be, Black Jack, Video Poker, Keno and Slot Machines. It can be played in two modes, Ranking play or Free Play. In Ranking mode the player enters a target amount to be reached and then plays against their opponents to see who can reach that amount. If a single player plays in this mode the game provides three opponents but the game caters for up to ten players with the game providing the additional AI opponents. Roulette,Video Poker, and Slot Machines in this game mode are played within a split screen. In Free mode there are no computer opponents and the games are the same as the games played in Ranking mode though there are minor differences, such as selecting which slot machine to play, because in this mode the split screen mode is not used at all. There are three kinds of slot machine which can be played for different stakes. Keno is the odd game here because it does not appear on the game menu, instead during any game other than Video Poker a casino hostess pops up in her own little window inviting the player to a game of Keno. If the player accepts they are shown a Keno card on which they mark their numbers after which their current game of Baccarat, Roulette or whatever resumes. A short while later the hostess window opens up again and the hostess gives the good, or more usually bad, news on how good their selections were. </story>

If the player is good enough to actually win the World Championship, they then have to defend their belt against numerous challengers. Players can improve their skills by winning matches and training between matches by sparring with their trainer. Advancing through this mode also unlocks boxers for the exhibition mode. In the ring, each boxer can throw punches like jabs, upper-cuts, hooks, and crosses, and is also able to duck and weave and block high and low while on defense. </story>

Besides the Main Event, players can elect to take part in an Exhibition Fight or Tournament, where 32 fighters compete through five rounds.

One or two players (in hot-seat or cooperative mode) control a spaceship equipped with a laser cannon which can be charged (by holding the shooting button down) for a stronger blast. Besides the main weapon, three special weapons are available- a wall of fire which wipes the screen up in a wave, a nova-like blast and a circle of spherical-green homing missiles.</story>

    <story>Take the law into your own hands. This game takes place in the Western United States during a time of world-wide oil shortage in 1976. OMAR (Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime) was making money off the shortage, except in the U.S. OMAR hires the best terrorist that $100 million could buy- Sid Burn. His job, aided by 5 hired Coyotes, is to destroy all gas refineries in the southwest of the U.S. so OMAR can bring the U.S. to its knees. Then later, when gas prices went wild, 6 civilians by the name of Vigilantes, lead by the truck driver Convoy, fight against the Coyotes in different areas to keep OMAR from succeeding. Choose from 8 characters with different endings with cars ranging to classic 70&apos;s muscle cars to a school bus, each stacked high with all sorts of weapons. Lots of unlockables include 2 hidden levels (3 hidden levels in the N64 version) and 5 hidden characters and cars. Multiplayer, of course, is where it&apos;s at. The PSX version allows 2 players, while the N64 title allows 4 to go head-to-head.</story>

Virtual Pool has revolutionary features that allow players to actually &apos;walk&apos; around the table to check out their next shot, take a closer look, back away, look left or right and then line-up the shot like they would in a real game with a real table. This title also allows players to take an overhead view from above, something unavailable in a real pool game! Taking game tips from World Champion pool player Machine Gun Lou Butera is guaranteed to improve the player&apos;s game.

Despite the fact that the game&apos;s opening and closing cinematics are set on a boat and space station like the film and comic series, the game itself is totally disconnected from both the source material and the game&apos;s own prologue and epilogue, instead being set in a high-tech hotel. In this survival horror game, the player controls the female police officer Joan, who, along with her partner Sutter, investigates numerous murders of the hotel&apos;s inhabitants, only to discover that an alien electronic virus uses mechanical items to create robots, who in turn are built into the human corpses, creating zombie-type cyborgs. The game features light puzzle elements along with weapon-based combat, utilizing weapons such as pistols, Uzis and tazers; while the ballistic weapons are replenished by ammunition pickups, the tazer utilizes a depletion-recharge system.</story>

Game modes include One or Two-Player Versus, One or Two-Player Rumble (one gang takes on the others one after another), Survival (fight everyone in your gang), Challenge, and Exhibition (computer fights itself). Fights are won by depleting as much of the opponent&apos;s life meter as possible within sixty seconds.

    <story>Inspired by the 1980s movie about a computer trying to take over the world, this action/strategy game allows you to field either the tanks of human NORAD or the walkers of AI-controlled WOPR, in warzones across the world. You control one vehicle and can cycle through all the units in your current army at any time, and there are limited commands you can issue to the rest of your army. For example, you can tell all the units in your army to follow your vehicle. However this can be unreliable due to poor pathfinding. There is a huge range of vehicles available for each army, from reconnaissance jeeps and bikes through heavy tanks and walkers all the way to the really special toys, laser and stealth tanks. There are air and sea assault troops available as well. You receive your mission objectives in e-mails sent from mission control (or WOPR itself) which update as you fulfill briefs. These can be as simple as &apos;go there, kill that&apos; but sometimes require more complex tasks such as picking up a spy from behind enemy lines, crippling a base&apos;s SAM sites to allow an attack from the air, and so on. One major draw of the game is an enjoyable two-player co-operative mode. Using a unique split-screen view (split diagonally instead of vertical/horizontal) both players control a vehicle each, and can cycle through the rest. This can be interesting as one player lends air support while the other storms the AA sites with a tank, for example. In addition to co-operative mode, there is a head-to-head multiplayer mode available and about 30 levels in the single player mode.</story>

    <story>Warhawk is an action/simulation game built around a futuristic VTOL craft. The player maneuvers with 360 degrees of flight control through 6 unique levels. 3D weapons include fire off lock-ons, rockets, multi-fire swarmers, and plasma cannons. The player will need all of these when deadly air and ground forces surround him in desert and volcanic wastelands, castle hallways and chambers, and gothic tower airships. There are no saving or loading features. Instead, a password is presented each time a level is completed. In 2007 Incognito Entertainment remade the title as a multiplayer-only PlayStation 3 game.</story>

    <story>A Formula 1 game without the official license, with a simulation mode and a very arcade mode. This is the sequel of F1 World Grand Prix. 22 cars racing on 17 tracks, against computer or even online. It also has a ghost mode to challenge you against your best time on each track. A replay also allows you to review your best laps. The game features some original camera (like the helmet view), and offers the possibility to fine-tune your car in simulation mode, so the immersion is total. However, it is focusing more on fun than on realism, and thus it is not the most accurate F1 simulation available. The game features a fast-paced arcade mode, dedicated to speed and fun.</story>

    <story>Earth&apos;s defense satellites accidentally launch nuclear warheads due to computer malfunction. Our planet is destroyed, except for a few factions that rebuild their strength and attempt to dominate the brave new world. As you make your way across the wasteland, hunting down artifacts and destroying hostile forces, you find out that the satellite&apos;s unexpected nuclear launch may not have been entirely accidental after all... You are in charge of searching the land for technological artifacts held by the other fellows. These artifacts are then researched to create new weapons, chasses, and propulsion types, all of which are interchangable, meaning there are over 2000 units for you to blow stuff up with. You can build tanks, hovercraft, Vertical Take Off/Landing (VTOL) vehicles, as well as cyborg units. There are machine guns, missile launchers, flame throwers, mortars, etc. Since all your technology comes from artifacts you swipe from your enemies, you are almost always fighting with weapons a step below what the other guy has, meaning you have to rely on your strategic prowess instead of sheer military superiority. The battlefield is fully 3D, the camera is rotatable and zoomable, and all units are 3D as well, except for humans, which are sprites, but they aren&apos;t too plentiful, so it&apos;s a minor point.</story>

    <story>Whizz is one of the few 3D platformers to use an isometric viewpoint. The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren’t always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you’d logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy –this reduces the significance of the points system.</story>

The player takes the role of a candidate and has to answer 15 questions by choosing the correct answer out of four given possibilities. For every right answer he receives money but he also loses money when choosing poorly (there are two guarantee points where he falls back to so he doesn&apos;t lose all). There are also three jokers- eliminating two false answers, asking the viewers in the studio per poll and phoning a friend. In the game the latter is a prerecorded conversion. The multiplayer mode is restricted to Fastest Finger competition where the next candidate is chosen. Here the players have to bring the four given answers into the right order and the fastest one wins. More questions are downloadable through the internet.</story>

    <story>Finally what all junior Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? fans have been waiting for! Relive the excitement and tension of the hit TV quiz show, in this junior edition of the best selling Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? computer game. With Chris Tarrant as the host and specially written questions for a younger audience, it&apos;s sure to be a huge hit with the whole family. Taking the simple yet effective formula of the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire hit TV show and turning it into a computer game has already yielded Eidos a major success. And with the PlayStation version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire--Junior Edition, a game that does precisely what it says on the box, that success is set to continue. The game closely follows the formula of the TV series as you battle through 15 questions on the way to the jackpot. Throw in three lifelines, Chris Tarrant voiceovers and the familiar graphics and music and the only major difference is the lack of cash at the end of it all. Up to four players can play, either joining forces or going against each other, although the junior target audience of this release does mean that the questions are easier than before (although by no means a walkover). And by not dressing the game up in fancy gimmicks purely because of the younger target market, the game offers wholesome family entertainment that involves the youngsters without alienating the older generation. </story>

    <story>Kayaking is the use of a kayak for moving across water. Kayaking and canoeing are also known as paddling. Kayaking is distinguished from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle. A kayak is defined by the International Canoe Federation (the world sanctioning body) as a boat where the paddler faces forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle. Most kayaks have closed decks, although sit-on-top kayaks are growing in popularity, as are inflatable kayaks which come without decks but which have air chambers surrounding the boat. Wild Rapids is the first ever PlayStation game to deliver the adrenaline hit that is white water kayaking. An out and out arcade game rather than a kayaking sim, Wild Rapids nonetheless delivers a realistic physics model giving just the right balance between player control and being buffeted by the water. </story>

    <story>Windsurfers Paradise is a 3d sports game based on the Windsurfing sport. Windsurfing is a surface water sport that combines elements of surfing and sailing. It consists of a board usually two to four meters long, powered by the orthogonal effect of the wind on a sail. The rig is connected to the board by a free-rotating universal joint and comprises a mast, wishbone boom and sail. The sail area ranges from less than 3.0 m2 to more than 12 m2 depending on the conditions, the skill of the sailor and the type of windsurfing being undertaken. Windsurfing, as a sport and recreational activity, did not emerge until the later half of the 20th century. But before this, there have been sailing boats of various designs that have used wind as the driving force for millennia, and Polynesians have been riding waves for many of them, undertaking day trips over oceans standing upright on a solid board with a vertical sail. </story>

Changes done to the 3D engine feature include on the fly in-game management with better player positioning AI (including the goalkeeper), and faster gameplay. An editor to change all player information is included, which affects simulated data- the team with higher ratings has a better chance of progressing through the next stage regardless if it is Brazil or China. It&apos;s possible to play with the groups as determined by the real draw, randomize or customize them to the players&apos; likings, mixing both qualified and additional teams. Once the player wins a trophy, the first of the Classics matches is unlocked. These are eight final matches in the competition&apos;s history which are unlocked as the player beats them one by one. Friendlies, training matches and practice penalty shootouts close the modes available. In the sound department, John Motson and Chris Waddle provide the commentary, Gary Lineker announces the next matches and BBC legend Kenneth Wolstenholme provides the commentary for classic matches. Chumbawamba, The Wizard of Oh, Boymerang and Fluke provide the licensed tracks in the game.</story>

    <story>Torneko- The Last Hope is the sequel to Torneko no Daibouken - Fushigi no Dungeon and like that game, stars Torneko (aka Taloon), the merchant from Dragon Warrior IV. Having become rich and properous in the previous game by collecting treasures, Torneko eventually recovered the Joy Chest from the very bottom of the dungeon and had it enshrined at his shop. Peace had returned to the town for some time. After awhile, a mysterious stranger arrived and seemed concerned about the Joy Chest being outside the dungeon. At the same time, monsters started reappearing and different parts of the kingdom began turning into mysterious dungeons. It will be up to middle-aged Torneko, to fight through these strange places and help the king discover what has broken the peace. Like other Fushigi no Dungeon games, Torneko- The Last Hope is a dungeon crawler viewed from the overhead. The dungeons are randomly generated. When venturing into dungeons, Torneko will find many items and fight monsters. He can freely move through the dungeons, but each movement or action of his is countered by those of the monsters (if they are present on screen). All actions are made in turns, so despite the illusion of walking and fighting in real time, the game is turn-based. There are all kinds of items in the dungeons including herbs which can be eaten or thrown, magic scrolls which can be read, swords and shields that can be equipped and staffs which can be waved until their charges are depleted. Players must also keep an eye on Torneko&apos;s hunger meter and eat regularly, otherwise Torneko will go into starvation and start losing hitpoints at a great rate. There are several ways to leave a dungeon including death, an Outside Scroll, donating to a Priest or reaching the very bottom floor. When leaving the dungeon areas, Torneko&apos;s experience points and stats are lost. To make money, he must sell items he has collected from the dungeon, but may keep a couple of his items in the Storage Room for later use. Torneko&apos;s village initially starts small, but as progress in made in the game more and more services and shops will be attracted to it. Some examples of services include a Bread Baker, a Witch, a Blacksmith, a Builder and a Meldersmith.</story>

    <story>Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around. Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack- the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends. There&apos;s a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders. There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.</story>

    <story>The final sequel (at least using the present engine) to the strategy game Worms, Worms Armageddon expands on Worms 2 by improving quite a few facets of gameplay and including play over the Internet through Team 17&apos;s WORMNET. For those who&apos;ve never played Worms, it&apos;s at heart similar to the old game Artillery, which you control an artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit your enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a team of Worms, but not only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep. Everything is presented in a humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves and their cries of triumph or despair, depending on how you do. Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and while an improvement over Worms 2, it&apos;s not a huge change.</story>

Also, each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, each round simply ends when you force the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter.

The user interface, weapons, and aliens are all the same. The only difference is the adaptation of the aliens and weapons to the ocean environment. The game features both undersea and on-land missions, and is significantly harder than its predecessor.</story>

    <story>The UFOs are invading our skies! Reports of human and bovine abductions are increasing daily! Cities are terrorized! Something must be done! XCOM, or eXtraterrestrial COMbat unit, was founded as an international force to combat the alien menace. Start with one base, two fighters, one transport, and a few soldiers, you must stop the alien threat... once and for all. X-COM- UFO Defense is a strategy game featuring separate but interlinked elements. On the strategic side, called GeoScape, you get a rotating view of the globe, where you see all visible UFOs (those that are within your detection range) as well as major cities and your base(s). You order movements from here, such as sending out fighters to intercept UFOs, transports with soldiers to assault/recover UFOs, and perhaps assaults on alien bases (if you find any). You also control your research, as you must invent better weapons (the Terran weapons are just no match against the alien weapons) quickly, not to mention all the other cool tech you can recover from the aliens. You also need to control your budget, as you can&apos;t afford to overextend your reach. Researchers need to be paid, engineers (who build the new toys) need to be paid, base(s) need to be be built/expanded, planes need to be bought/maintained, supplies need to be replenished... You can earn money by selling unneeded stuff, and you receive funding from the nations of the world; however, a nation can decrease its funding if it decides you aren&apos;t operating efficiently enough within its region. It&apos;s even possible that a nation gets so fed up with you that it signs a pact with the aliens and ceases funding altogether. Once you join a ground battle, the game switches to Battlescape, which is an isometric view of the battlefield with realistic line-of-sight calculations and turn-based combat. Your mission is usually extermination of all aliens on the battlefield, though if you can capture a few it would surely help your research efforts. If you win, you also recover any alien artifacts left on the field, which can then be researched. In combat, each of your soldiers has a specific number of Time Units. Doing anything (moving, shooting, turning around, rearranging objects in the inventory etc.) costs a number of TUs. Once a soldier is out of TUs, he cannot act any more this turn (he gets all his TUs back on the next turn, though). The game aims to mix strategic considerations, resource management, and tactical combat considerations, along with plenty of authentic UFO lore.</story>

Similar to the Super Combo gauge in Super Street Fighter II Turbo there is an X-Power gauge of different levels, filled up when the player performs moves. When it is maxed out an X-Ability or Hyper X special move can be performed. Other general features are the abilities to super jump, roll away and aiming projectiles.</story>

There are plenty of bonus things to find on the CD, ranging from movie clips of your fighter after you complete the game with him/her, new costumes (each fighter starts with costumes from the comics. The new ones, when unlocked, are much like the ones in the movie) and a movie story if you complete the game with all of the fighters.

To do so, the player has a choice between three types of space ship, each of them differs in terms of firepower and speed. The game has two different difficulty modes and a password system to resume the fight for the first five levels. During gameplay, the player has the possibility to pick up a wide variety of power-ups for their ship. Next to the main gun, side weapons and anti-gravity orbs with their own firepower can be obtained as well as mega-bombs, among other things. The game is over once all lives or continues are used up.

    <story>Xenocracy is a cross between a space combat action sim and a political strategy game with a unique premise. In the far future, four planetary superpowers (the Earth Dominion, the Mercury League, the Venus Alliance and the Mars Combine) are vying for control of the solar system and on the brink of all-out thermostellar war. As commander of the United Planet Nations peacekeeping fighter squadron, your role is to maintain the balance and prevent cold war and localized conflicts from escalating into open interplanetary hostilities. Further complicating the matter, you must deal with pirates and a looming alien threat. As each planetary superpower launches low-intensity strikes (as opposed to open warfare) against the colonies and outposts of the other three, you are presented with the choice, via a strategic solar system map showing flaring geopolitical hotspots, of which to aid. If you aid one superpower too much at the expense of the others, as one is first tempted to do, you upset the balance and cause the war you sought to prevent. Whichever you choose, afterward you are realistically presented with complaints and political propaganda from the other three superpowers, and receive news broadcasts concerning the interplanetary geopolitical wrangling. In addition to keeping the peace, you also manage research and development of newer and more powerful technologies, which will eventually prove crucial. Several fighter and weapon types are available, and the scenery varies from asteroid belts and dust clouds to planetary surfaces. You may choose from several wingmen, each with a personal description and personality type, whom you must do your best to keep alive. Missions include such tasks as defending mine complexes from attack (or attacking them) and protecting convoys (or destroying them). Xenocracy also allows Arcade Mode, in which you simply fly missions without regard to the strategic aspects of the game, and multiplayer games of up to 8 players over TCP/IP or serial connections.</story>

    <story>Yeh Yeh Tennis is an all-new tennis simulation from Sunsoft. The way the game is structured allows players to create their own players from scratch choosing not only the physical attributes of the players and their characteristic styles of play but also their temperament. So for example you could choose a left-handed smash and volley player with a fierce backhand and a fiery temperament who excels on clay. Or a defensive back-line player with a mean forehand drive and an attitude that is as cool as a cucumber and who perhaps favours the more traditional grass surface. Once the individual qualities of your original player have been chosen then the job of steering this player through the modest local tournaments, the more illustrious national tournaments and then the prestigious Grand slam events begins. The player must hone his or her skills using practice modes or match practice to gradually increase their world ranking until he or she is an established seeded player ready to take on the very best. The player has seven seasons in which to become the Grand Slam Champion and thereby the world number one. The tournament pattern itself is taken from the real life structure of competition so players can really immerse themselves in the competitive world of the Pro-Tennis and make this a thoroughly entertaining and absorbing experience. </story>

In comparison to the browser game this version adds additional obstacles which stop the penguin, wales which give a speed boost when the penguin lands on it and wind. There is also an additional playing mode where the player has to strike other ice bears which are standing on the runway. •Orca Slap- Based on Yetisports Part 2- Orca Slap. Here the player stands in front of a big dart board. Then penguins fly into the screen (on at a time) and the player has to throw a snowball at them. The the penguin gets deflected and flies to the dart board and the player scores. The goal is to get a high score. In comparison to the browser game this version adds a slot machine between rounds where the player can get additional penguins or snowballs. There is also an additional playing mode where the player has to hit specific fields on the dart board. Both games feature improved graphics and a multiplayer mode.</story>

    <story>Yetisports World Tour is the second game in the Yetisports games series for the Playstation One console. The first one was Yetisports Deluxe. Yetisports (also known as Pingu Throw) is a web-based Flash game that originally appeared on the Internet in January 2004. The goal of the original game is to have a yeti smack a penguin with a club and try to get it fly as far as possible. The original Yetisports game features no name other than the words 1978 Reinhold + Yeti, a reference to Reinhold Messner&apos;s claim to have found Yetis. The game is humorous and addictive at the same time and therefore very popular on the Internet. Very soon after release, there was a quick succession of many variants created by multiple people on the internet. None of these are officially sponsored by Chris Hilgert, even though many copy the original almost exactly save certain small changes. One of the more violent variants was made by someone known as &apos;Pawel&apos;, featuring decapitation, spikes, a big spiky club and mines. Since the original was released at the Yetisports homepage, the website has released nine further adventures of the Yeti as well as a re-release of the original that allows movement of the penguin in flight. A further set of PlayStation exclusive games followed, released as YetiSports World Tour which is one of the very last titles to be released on the console As most retail outlets no longer supporting the PS1 from 2005 it struggled to find shops willing to stock it. The game features 10 new mini games (that wasn&apos;t released before) and they can be played by one player or up to 4 players in multiplayer mode. After Antarctic and Australia (Pingu Throw, Orca Slap, Seal Bounce and Albatross Overload episodes), Africa will be the next continent where the famous Yeti and his peguins will arrive today. Underneath giraffes, over elephants and acacias, catapulted high up to the sky by snakes and carried by vultures, the penguin demonstrates clean flying tricks on advanced level. With the help of Nile-flamingos, Yeti undertakes the probably most amusing safari in the African savanna in the fifth part of the cult-series. Some of the game games are- Pingu Throw, Orca Slap, Seal Bounce, Albatross Overload &amp; Flamingo Drive. </story>

The player can choose from one of the eight combatants that are available at the start, with a few more characters being available once their unlocked. Each character has a different nationality, specialty, and lineage. Each character represents either a good or an evil alignment and depending on the character chosen, it affects which final boss the player will have to fight against. Defending, punching and kicking are on three separate buttons. There are variations of each of these moves depending on how quick the button is pressed. Consistently damaging or taking damage from an opponent will add to a sol or lunar (depending on the character the player is playing as) power gauge. When this gauge is filled, the player is temporarily invincible and allows the player to use strong power assault moves. </story>

    <story>Z is a real-time strategy game in which you fight for control of the sectors, some of which contains manufactories that can gain you additional units. Touch the flag in the sector and it&apos;s yours. Capture the sector before the new unit comes out of the manufactory and the new unit is yours. With six different robots (different armaments, armor, and speed), multiple vehicles (from jeeps to tanks) the robots can utilize, your ultimate objective is to destroy the opponent&apos;s base, and prevent him from doing the same to you. The game differs from many other RTSs by emphasizing territorial control (and the manufactories) instead of getting kills and gathering a big army. You have to finely balance defense and offense. If you wait too long, the enemy will grab all the manufactories first. If you go too fast, you&apos;ll get hammered for stretching yourself too thin. You can hijack enemy vehicles by shooting the driver off. If you send a group of soldiers toward an objective and they find a vehicle, one of them will split off to grab the vehicle; you don&apos;t really need to micromanage each soldier. </story>

However, the leader of the hackers reveals that the group have also unleashed a second artificial intelligence into the data library, known as EVE. The player must take control of one of EVE&apos;s attack programs and use them to destroy the other guard programs and then EVE herself. The first sequel to the early Play Station fighter Zero Divide features all new higher resolution graphics and higher poly models than the original game. It adds two new robots, the nurse like Pixel and the crab like Cancer along with a few new bosses and hidden characters. It adds a variety of different shaped and new arena types (the original game only had standard square arenas) from completely walled in ones to ones with low barriers that the opponent can be juggled over to lead to a ring out. Rounds are now considerably shorter and the robot&apos;s armour easier to knock off. But on the whole, it really does play pretty much the same as the original game.</story>
