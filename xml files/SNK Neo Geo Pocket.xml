    <story>Using the Japanese SD (Super-Deformed) artwork style, the KOF Series makes your debut in SNK&apos;s monochrome handheld bringing the same gameplay characteristics found in its arcade/console counter-part The King of Fighters &apos;97, like the possibility of choose between two game modes (Advanced or Extra), an identical adaptation of the battle stages, the chance to battle against Leona and Iori in their Orochi-versions and the same storyline involving the New Faces Team (Yashiro Nanakase, Shermie and Chris), that are using the tournament to accumulate enough energy to wake up his supreme master- Orochi.</story>

    <story>Neo Geo Cup &apos;98 is a football/soccer game for the Neo Geo Pocket. This version is different from Neo Geo Cup &apos;98- The Road to the Victory — here playing field is vertical-scrolling, not side-scrolling. The game has less national teams than the bigger version — the player can choose one from 16 teams. Neo Geo Cup &apos;98 is an unofficial adaptation of the World Cup - SNK has made a fictional Neo Geo Cup. Gameplay is quite simple; the player controls a football team and must win matches against rival teams. The game uses simple 2-buttons and stick controls (limits of the Neo Geo Pocket).</story>

    <story>Puzzle Link is a game where blocks of matching color have to be dissolved. New blocks constantly scroll into the screen from the top. The game is over when the first blocks reach the bottom of the screen. You can dissolve blocks by shooting at them. The shots form a line where they impact. If that line connects otherwise unconnected blocks of the same color they will dissolve. There are three different modes- In Normal you have to link two special blocks that appear after some time. If you manage to finish the level within the time limit you will unlock one of 50 collectible cards. In Clear Mode you have to clear a given constellation of blocks. Battle Mode is a two player link-cable mode.</story>

    <story>Syougi (usually transliterated as shōgi) is Japanese chess - a turn-based board game (the board has 9x9 squares) very similar to normal chess, but all pieces are different. There we have- -1 king -1 rook -1 bishop -2 gold generals -2 silver generals -2 knights -2 lances -9 pawns. Each unit has own move and all units are weaker than chess counterparts (for example Knight/Horse can&apos;t go backward), but all figures can be promoted and gain new moves. The player must defeat the enemy&apos;s king. Master of Syougi is an electronic version of this classic board game, where players can choose fight characters to fight and change several rules.</story>
