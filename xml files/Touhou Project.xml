    <story>It is autumn in Gensokyo. A stranger comes to the Hakurei Shrine and says that the shrine should close for good. Reimu Hakurei won&apos;t let it happen so she or Marisa Kirisame goes to investigate the situation. The heroine goes to the Youkai Mountain where she meets three gods and eventually Nitori Kawashiro, who says the kappa are troubled by a new god on the mountain. As she advances further, the heroine meets Aya Shameimaru, who was told to investigate the intruder. Aya is beaten and the heroine moves to the Moriya Shrine. Sanae Kochiya says that the new god, later shown to be Kanako Yasaka, is trying to collect faith. After Sanae is defeated, Kanako appears and explains her motives. She eventually makes peace with the kappa and tengu, who, in return, accept Kanako as the new god of the mountain, supplying her with faith. In the Extra stage, the heroines meet the other god of the Moriya Shrine, Suwako Moriya, who is the shrine&apos;s true god. Suwako demands that they play with her in a danmaku battle, just like they&apos;ve played with Sanae and Kanako. </story>

    <story>Suddenly a geyser erupted out of nowhere, which Reimu Hakurei and Marisa Kirisame took advantage of, even though a higher amount of earth spirits showed up. But others got worried, and wanted them to go down into the Underworld, with a device Yukari Yakumo made so they could talk even underground. After passing the tsuchigumo Yamame Kurodani and the jealous bridge princess Parsee Mizuhashi, the heroine reaches the Former Capital, a place where now the oni live. Yuugi Hoshiguma challenges the heroine on a friendly battle, and then says the heroine should go to the Palace of the Earth Spirits. Here, the heroine met Satori Komeiji, the owner of both Rin Kaenbyou (Orin) and Utsuho Reiuji (Okuu). Rin wanted the heroine to come down and help her stop her friend as Utsuho became too powerful, and Utsuho eventually was stopped by the heroine. Afterwards, the heroine visits the Moriya Shrine to talk with Kanako Yasaka and Suwako Moriya. The goddesses were not there, but she does meet Satori&apos;s sister, Koishi Komeiji, who wanted to go to the Moriya Shrine to ask the gods to empower her pets. In the end, they have a duel because Koishi wanted to see if the person who defeated her sister was really that strong. </story>

    <story>The story of Undefined Fantastic Object is about a strange flying object that appears in the skies of Gensokyo during the early springtime. The player character will, for whatever reason their shot type description says, launch off into the sky to unravel its mysteries, plunder its treasure, and generally get rid of youkai. Upon reaching the Stage 4 boss, Minamitsu Murasa, the story begins to unravel. The objective of most of the enemies in the game is to free a human named Byakuren Hijiri from a sealed sleep of hundreds of years. Interestingly enough, every character besides Kogasa Tatara has an important role in the plot. Each with their own reasons, the enemies attempt to collect these UFOs - actually fragments of the floating vault, Tobikura - the player has been collecting, but the player eventually unseals and faces Byakuren herself out of curiosity. After the events of the main story, it is known that Byakuren and her followers erect a Buddhist temple in Gensokyo. However, in order to figure out what the UFO objects really were, the player later encounters Nue Houjuu, who reveals that she was the one aiding and obstructing both the player and enemy factions during the main story. The reason the fragments of Tobikura had been scattered was because she had placed Seeds of Unknown Form in them, and the reason they appeared to be UFOs was essentially because nothing else should be floating through the sky like that. </story>

    <story>Strange rumors are circulating in the Human Village. A dog with a human&apos;s face was rummaging in the compost pile. Somebody saw an old woman selling humans&apos; feet. These pointless rumors have exploded, and driven the children into fear. Unlike the youkai whose natural purpose is to attack humans, these rumors are both unsettling and impossible to discern the truth underneath. Since there were no real victims, the adults have come to think of them as merely children&apos;s silly talks. Of course, the girls are not afraid. They know these to be the outside world&apos;s urban legends (made-up stories). Urban legends have an interesting property. As the circulating rumors change, the anomalies will change correspondingly. Reimu and company have assumed the rumors that fit them, and treat the anomalies as their playthings. As long as one can control the rumors without being afraid, the manifested anomalies can be rendered harmless. More than that, they can be turned into powers of one&apos;s own. The girls thought of controlling the urban legends by themselves as a necessary measure for keeping people from harm. This had indeed been true. Until one night... </story>

    <story>Once, there was a being named Junko, a divine spirit with a grudge against the lunarians, especially Chang&apos;e. This grudge came from the fact that Chang&apos;e&apos;s husband shot down nine out of ten suns, according to legend, one of them landing on her son and killing him. Since then, she purified her grudge to the point where she&apos;s nothing more than pure resentment. Junko calmed her rage by repeatedly attacking the Lunar Capital, but none of her attacks have been successful. Then she met with Hecatia Lapislazuli, a goddess of Hell who sympathized with her because she also had a grudge against Chang&apos;e. Hecatia allowed Junko to use fairies such as Clownpiece in her plan to invade the Lunar Capital and leave Chang&apos;e vulnerable. Junko purified the Hell fairies into pure life force so they can wreak havoc on the Lunar Capital while also being immune to the lunarians&apos; purifying weaponry. Because of this, the goddess Sagume Kishin and the moon sages froze the Lunar Capital and asked Doremy Sweet to make a replica Lunar Capital in the Dream World. Since the Lunarians couldn&apos;t stay in the Dream World forever, Sagume developed the Lunar Capital Transfer Plan, which involved purifiying Gensokyo so it could be inhabited by the lunarians. But youkai were also living in Gensokyo, so Sagume created an Occult Orb that could spread a particular urban legend called the Apollo Project Coverup Theory, so the Lunar Capital could materialize in Gensokyo, prompting the events of Urban Legend in Limbo, which would later turn into the events of Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom. </story>

    <story>Something has wrecked the Hakurei Shrine, and the resident Shrine Maiden isn&apos;t going to take it lying down. She charges through the gateway into another worlds, intent on locating and punishing the one responsible for the act. Although she isn&apos;t capable of harming her enemies directly, she wields an incredible weapon- the Yin-Yang Orb. With it Reimu will be able to cut a bloody swath through all who stand before her... assuming that she can manage to control it! The story itself is non-existent throughout the game itself. After Stage 5, the player can choose either to follow the gate into Hell or the gate into Makai, each with their own enemies. It is implied that Reimu defeats whoever originally destroyed her shrine. The endings for the game are equally difficult to understand, as depending on which route the player takes, the Yin-Yang Orb will transform into a tiny wish-granting fairy or a joyful, but strange creature that starts smashing parts of the shrine. The bad ending for the game involves Reimu leaving and then a giant explosion is seen, something also difficult to understand. Almost all of the characters never appear again, save for Mima, who appears to reside in the hokora near the Hakurei Shrine.

Reimu Hakurei and the others are currently having a feast every three days at the Hakurei shrine. During these feasts, a strange mist appears. The playable character decides to get the cause of the never-ending feast schedule and the mist. This incident was later called the Night Parade of One Hundred Oni Every Four Days by Aya Shameimaru in Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red. The perpetrator of the incident is an oni, said to have disappeared from Gensokyo, named Suika Ibuki. She thought that it was a shame that the flower-viewing season had been cut short due to the very long winter. She spread herself out in the form of a mist all throughout Gensokyo, and gathered the hearts of both humans and youkai to cause them to have a feast every few days. Because the art of oni extermination has been lost to Gensokyo, the girls could not eliminate her, but the mist disappeared afterwards and feasts started to happen less frequently. </story>

    <story>In Shoot the Bullet, you play as Aya Shameimaru as she photographs the bosses from various Touhou games. However, no one ever reveals why she is taking these photos. In fact, at one point it is pointed out that No one knows the purpose of the photos, except Aya, and the only reason she does not shoot the opponents is not to be nice, but because she doesn&apos;t want her bullets in the picture. </story>

    <story>Kioh Gyoku is a vertical danmaku shooting game with massive emphasis on grazing streaming bullets, where two characters engage in danmaku gameplay within individual and separate play areas (aka. split-screen). Upon meeting certain conditions, players are able to unleash a variety of character-specific attacks upon their opponents in an attempt to whittle down their remaining health points. In Story Mode, the player will face five opponents, each more capable than the previous. Kioh Gyoku also features a Match Play Mode where the player may face off against AI opponents or compete against other players, as well as watch AI vs. AI matches. </story>

    <story>In 2785, full-scale war breaks out on Earth over the various nations&apos; rights to extraplanetary resources. This war ravages the Earth&apos;s environment, forcing humanity to flee underground. It also sees the creation of the M.R.S. (Machine manufacture Research and development System), an automated manufacturing and battle system designed to allow wars to take place without actual human participation. Unfortunately, within five years of humanity&apos;s flight underground, M.R.S. has completely taken control of the Earth&apos;s surface, and the first exploratory group from humanity&apos;s underground Shelters is annihilated. Not long after this first exploratory mission, the M.R.S. system discovers the Absolute Dimensional Barrier technology and eventually refines it into the Dimensional Absolute Barrier Shield; it uses its SMD series of warplanes to test and perfect the system. Unfortunately, the prototype unit, SMD-00x, disappears after activating the barrier for the first time, and though M.R.S. is eventually able to establish contact with the dimensional void into which SMD-00x disappeared, it&apos;s never actually able to find the ship again. Nevertheless, the system continues developing the SMD series, creating smaller, more capable craft such as the SMD-24-0x Samidare, which is piloted by a humanoid control unit, C-22, and the final unit, SMD-31-FX Gesshoku, whose control unit, C-23, possesses an advanced, self-aware AI. Meanwhile, humanity is busy urbanizing its Shelters, developing bipedal robots (armed lightweight walking vehicles, or ALWVs), and preparing to take the fight to M.R.S. Sixty years after the cataclysm that drove humanity underground, it finally emerges to retake the surface. By this time, M.R.S. has developed significant internal defects, and the battle is relatively short. Within two decades, almost all M.R.S.-created automata on the surface have been destroyed. Samidare&apos;s main story mode follows the major missions of SMD-24-0x- its testing against the biomechanical construct Sylphid, its encounter with Anareta, the defense system of long-ruined space outpost Tetra-Biblos, and its encounter with the SMD series prototype, SMD-00x. The extra mode follows a flight of the SMD-31-FX several decades later, after SMD-24-0x makes it back to Earth (if you get the good ending). </story>
