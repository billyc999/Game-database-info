    <story>This is an enhanced version of 1942- The Pacific Air War, with most of the graphics and sounds reworked. There are also changes in the weapons and the inclusion of anachronical items such as laser-firing WWII planes and ships that run on ground. The player controls a biplane Boeing Stearman E75 N68828 instead of the P-38. The PC Engine adaptation adds some original levels to those from the arcade version, as well as animated intermissions.</story>

Four players (any combination of human and computer) take it in turns to roll dice and move around the isometric board, landing on various event squares. The ultimate aim is to build as many hotels as you can and make more loot than your opponents. </story>

    <story>Wonder Boy III- The Dragon&apos;s Trap is a direct sequel to Wonder Boy in Monster Land. When Tom-Tom defeats the MEKA dragon, the wounded beast casts a spell on him, turning him into a Lizard-Man. To regain his original human form, he has to find the Salamander Cross, hidden by the Vampire Dragon in Monster Land. Unlike its predecessor, this side-scrolling platform game is not divided in sequences of levels. The protagonist is allowed to go anywhere, as long as he has the right shape or equipment. During his quest, Tom-Tom has to defeat various dragon bosses. Each win will give him a new shape with new abilities such as flying, swimming, walking on ceilings or clinging to walls. These abilities also allow the player access new parts of the world. The possible shapes are Lizard-Man, Mouse-Man, Piranha-Man, Lion-Man and Hawk-Man and the main abilities are defined by attacking power, defense points and charm points (needed for equipment by collecting charm stones). Also, certain blocks can only be destroyed by specific weapons or are only accessible to certain shapes. The basic actions consist of attacking and jumping, and in the status screen it is possible to equip swords, shields and armour. Special attacks include fire balls, tornadoes, arrows, boomerangs and thunder strikes. Along the way, the player collects keys (only one at all times) and gold left behind by defeated creatures, and places need to be re-visited sometimes to access new areas. Equipment and items can be bought in towns. A password is given at the beginning of each town to continue from there.</story>

At your disposal is a vulcan cannon (basically a machine gun) and a limited number of missiles. In some versions of the game the guns fire automatically all the time. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles. The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. You also can speed up and slow down to deal with enemies which appear behind you.</story>

    <story>Aoi Blink is a side-scrolling platformer based on the TV anime series of the same name. The five levels are similarly built as the ones in Super Mario Bros. 3- they are divided into various areas which are reached through a map screen with branching paths. Those areas need to be solved to be able to walk further on the map. The speciality of this game is that the player can switch between three characters with different abilities on the fly, e.g. one can jump high and another has a better gun. Those are important to be able to solve the challenges the levels bring, mostly consisting of traditional platforming and avoiding/shooting enemies. However, the boss area at the end of the level map has to be opened with a master key. There is one hidden in every area. The three characters are based on characters of the series and change depending on the level. The health pool is shared between all characters and losing all hearts results in losing a life. Hearts can be refilled by collecting money which is left behind by killed enemies.</story>

Before each level, a cutscene with scenes from the movie is displayed. Batman can attack his enemies with his Batarang.

When it hits one it will continue moving in the same direction, rebounding off walls if neccessary, and pushing you backwards slightly if it comes back to you - but it can be instantaneously brought back under control. Blocks can also be moved at a more casual speed, including round corners. Once a block is placed onto its spot, it can be used again as a weapon. The levels are in a maze style, and parts of this can be opened up. The game also includes a small bonus Kick-Ball game for 2 players, which doubles as practice with the control system.</story>

    <story>For many years, monsters have been terrorizing the peaceful lands, until finally, the Buddhist priests known as the Dharma Eyes found a safe heaven in a secluded temple, where they raised young martial artists who would eventually liberate the people from the monsters. One day, one of these disciples was kidnapped by monsters and taken into their tower. The current Dharma Eye instructs another disciple, named Oniwaka, to venture towards the tower to the south and find a way to rescue his friend... and perhaps finally put an end to the monster invasion. Benkei Gaiden is a traditional Japanese-style RPG, set in an environment reminiscent of Japan of the feudal epoch, with supernatural elements such as monsters etc. The player navigates Oniwaka on the top-down map, visiting towns, buying equipment (weapons and armor), and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Obviously, the game has been heavily influenced by the early Dragon Quest games; the interaction menu is nearly identical (the player has to bring up a menu and choose verb commands such as &amp;quot;Talk&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Search&amp;quot;, rather than perform different actions simply by pressing a button), and the general gameplay system does not deviate from the classic formula.</story>

The people were very proud of him and gave Tom-Tom the highest honor of all - the legendary name of Wonder Boy. With the evil King defeated, Wonder Land returned to its peaceful state, and for over one decade, the kingdom was a paradise, and everything and everyone lived happily together. Eventually, the peace was broken when a ferocious fire-breathing dragon appeared out of nowhere and took over Wonder Land with an army of evil, monsterous henchmen, causing Wonder Land was immediately thrown into utter chaos. Defenseless that they were, the people were quickly taken over and the tranquil and serene kingdom was transformed into a land of demons and devils. Wonder Land was now a Monster Land. Tom-Tom was summoned to set out on a journey, destroy this dragon, and restore peace once again. Tom-Tom is Wonder Land&apos;s last hope. There are twelve locations in which Tom-Tom must venture through, including (but not limited to)- the city of Wonder Land, Valley of Peace, The Coastal Town of Baraboro, The Mam Desert, and Pororo Islands. During his journey, he must defeat monsters with the sword that he got at the beginning of his adventure. These monsters will leave either gold coins or bags of cash, which he can use to buy better weapons, shields, armors, and boots. At the end of each location, there is usually a boss that Tom-Tom must defeat in order to obtain a gold key that will unlock the exit gate, as well as plenty of gold coins or bags of cash. If he touches any enemies, or is shot at, he will lose health. During his travels, Tom-Tom must take note of the hourglass; if the hourglass display sands at the bottom, he must get another one that appears out of nowhere, or he&apos;ll also lose health. There are two ways in which he can restore it. He can either go into bars to have a drink that will restore it and get a hint about what lies ahead as well, or go into hospitals and heal himself to restore the lost health. </story>

    <story>Blodia is a puzzle game with similarities to sliding block puzzles. Each level is composed of a number of tiles and every one has a part of a pipe (straight or angular) on it - except one which is just a black hole. In one tile a red ball starts rolling and all tiles it rolls through become blank. The goal of each level is to let the ball roll through all pipe parts without meeting the hole or a blank tile. To ensure this, the player can move the parts while using the hole as buffer. So, as example, if the player clicks on a tile which is a few tiles away from the hole, all tiles between the clicked tile and the hole are moved by one towards the hole. Then the hole is at the place where the player clicked on. At the start of a puzzle, rolling out of the level boundaries is also deadly, but after a certain amount of tiles are cleared the ball comes out at the opposite side of the playfield.</story>

    <story>The story of this game is rather simple- the world is in peril, as the evil witch Topaz sends her seductive minions to terrorize the wilderness, plotting to overthrow the rightful king and conquer the world. A young prince is born, who is destined to be the one who slays Topaz. His first quest is to retrieve a magical armor which is essential for the victory. But the evil sexy female demons will do everything in their powers to stop the hero... Bodyconquest II is in many ways a homage to the first Dragon Quest game. The gameplay is nearly identical- the lone hero fights randomly appearing enemies in one-on-one battles, gains experience and money, gradually levels up, waits until he can afford better weapons and armor and venture into an area with stronger monsters, etc. Even the menu with commands such as Talk and Search is copied almost verbatim from the father of Japanese RPGs. The one distinguishing feature of this game is the sex appeal of the enemies. They are young, female, and tend to wear less than what we would usually associate with the medieval codex of modesty. Scantily clad girls, suggestive poses, and sexual innuendo abound; but no explicit scenes which would warrant an adult rating.</story>

    <story>Users Battle is a Bomberman game for the PC Engine, released only in Japan. It bears a 1990 copyright, just like the original release of Bomberman for the platform. Additionally, it plays the same title screen music upon boot, but it has a different title screen, only allowing for multiplayer play for two to five players. It lacks the skull mode option of the full Bomberman release, but otherwise shows similar menus and styles to Bomberman&apos;s multiplayer mode. It is believed that Users Battle was created in extremely limited quantities for use at tournaments, demo kiosks, or both. Some online sources estimate the number of cards produced at around 1,000. </story>

    <story>Black Bomberman has cut power to the galaxy&apos;s own power station, which resulted in disputes between seven planets, and it is up to White Bomberman to restore power to the station and bring peace to the planets again. The objective is the same as in Dyna Blaster- use bombs to destroy all enemies in a level. Once you have destroyed them all, find the exit hidden in a block so you can be transported to the next level. A block will also flash yellow to let you know that a power-up can be obtained there. Power-ups include more bombs, manual detonation, extra lives, and extended flames. Occasionally, you also get the ability to walk through bombs or walls, or to kick bombs. If you manage to reveal the exit before all enemies are destroyed, it remains in an inactive state, meaning that you cannot be transported to the next level until you blow up all the enemies and therefore making it active. If you accidentally blow up the exit, whether it is active or not, or if time runs out, you will unleash a few enemies that you also need to destroy. After every eighth level, there is a boss that you need to destroy to proceed to the next planet. Besides this Normal mode, there are two other modes- Battle and Versus. In Battle, you can play against four human- or computer-controlled players in one of seven stages, each with different features like warp holes, conveyor belts, revolving doors, and much more. In Versus, you play head-to-head against a friend using the TurboExpress for non-stop action. Regardless of these two modes, you can still obtain power-ups to give out some punishment against your fellow players, and the maximum number of wins can be set before play.</story>

    <story>Mega Bomberman is a top-down action game. Control your Bomberman through various levels defeating multiple enemies and plenty of bosses. Each level consist of blocks for exploding and some blocks that don&apos;t explode. At times you will need the non-exploding blocks as shelter. The blocks that do explode reveal power-ups and eggs. The eggs are the unique twist to this version of Bomberman. When you get a egg, it hatches into a kangaroo. There are multiple kangaroo types, each with their own unique ability. You hop on the back of the kangaroo and utilize it&apos;s ability. If you happen to walk into an explosion the kangaroo takes the damage and dies and you continue to live. Another unique feature in multiplayer is you can choose your character. Pick one of 9 such as Miner, Tiny, Fat, Cop, Punk (On cover), Lady, Old man, Robot and the original Bomberman. After selecting your character get ready for battle as you are placed in 1 of the 4 corners of the arena. Now just blow your way through the blocks and attack some opponents. Watch out for their bombs and remember to dodge your own. There are also many arena&apos;s to choose from. Each arena has it&apos;s own twist such as trap doors, an igloo to hide in, conveyor belts and more.</story>

    <story>The black spaceman kidnapped your beloved and brought her to his chambers in the castle, far beyond your reach, over the rivers, forest and mountains. Your job is to save her, battling the sea of the enemies, with only bombs at your disposal. The range of explosion can be upgraded with time, but if you die, the range resets to minimum and you loose your previous skills, though. Some updates can make you walk through the walls, increase your speed, and give you some other assets to aid you in your quest to save the woman you love. This top-down action-arcade game consists of nine levels per stage, each tougher than the other, and each final consisting of the boss you&apos;ll have to deal with. You can move horizontally and vertically and lay down bombs behind you thus evaporating the enemies, but beware, &apos;cos you can block yourself with your own bomb, and become a victim of your own tricks if you&apos;ll play in a huff.</story>

    <story>Bullfight- Ring no Hasha is a boxing game in which the player takes part in a competition with eight boxers. The tournament consists of four fights and a finale and each boxer can be controlled by a human player. The boxers have different statistics (strength, agility and endurance) which can be improved between fights with a training fight. Each boxer has four moves (left swing, right swing, uppercut and dodge) and a hit both depletes the opponent&apos;s energy bar and gives points. Similar to real boxing, those points are used to determine the winner if no boxer is knocked out during the regular rounds. A knockout happens when the energy runs out, but when the player mashes a button fast enough when the boxer is given a count, he stands up again with a partly replenished energy bar. Additionally there is also a side-scrolling fighting game included. Here the player walks from left to right and fights enemies in martial arts melee combat.</story>

    <story>City Hunter is based on the eponymous manga by Tsukasa Hojo. The story focuses on Ryo Saeba, a young man with a mysterious past, who founds the City Hunter team in Shinjuku, Tokyo. The City Hunter is an underground private detective agency, which takes care of particularly dangerous cases. In the game, the player is able to play through three of such cases, which are unrelated to each other and can be played in any order. The gameplay is essentially that of a side-scrolling shooter. The player navigates Ryo through the stages, dispatching of the frequently appearing enemies with his gun. The gameplay system is rather simple, without power-ups or different weapons, and with one items possible to carry at a time. The levels are usually designed as vast indoor areas, with many rooms Ryo can enter. The structure of the game also reveals mild adventure elements- often it is necessary to speak to a character, receive an item (such as a key), back-track to a previous area in order to reach a previously inaccessible room, etc.</story>

    <story>Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up &apos;combos&apos; - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines. As well as the normal game mode, there is also a &apos;flash&apos; mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.</story>

The basic idea is traditional- shooting everything before they can shoot/touch the player- after three hits the chitin armor breaks and a life is lost. Besides flying enemies which are disposed of with the standard gun, the player also has to deal with enemies on the ground which need to be hit with one of the unlimited bomb. The player has the choice between four insect forms which are changed by collecting the associated extra symbols. Collecting more of the same symbol upgrades the insect, but this also rises the difficulty level. Other extras include smart bombs, extra lives, armor refreshments or a protection shield. The game features the possibility to turn on rapid fire or to slow down the speed as well as big boss enemies at the end and within the levels.</story>

Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat- The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant Module mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed Berserkers. The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home. Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind NeoParts, which can be brought back to the Swordfish&apos;s lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills. Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of options that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints- one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.</story>

    <story>Twin Hawk is a typical vertical scrolling shooter with a top-down view. Your goal is easy, shoot all the enemies along the way. You only get a standard gun on your plane, and no bombs. Instead of bombs you can call helper planes. These planes make a formation around you and help to shoot all enemies. Along the way you get the chance to collect power-ups by shooting transport trucks. When these are destroyed they release a power-up. There are three types. First is the weapon upgrade, with this you get a wider and more powerful shot. Second, you get more calls for helper planes. And third are extra lives. </story>

    <story>One of the rarest games for the PC Engine, Darius Alpha was only offered to those who bought both the CD and HuCard versions of Darius Plus (Which doesn&apos;t make much sense, considering how similar the two versions are). People who just couldn&apos;t get enough of Darius could now play another variation on the same theme. Darius Alpha is built on the same codebase as Darius Plus, but has been remodeled into a so-called boss-fight game, e.g. a game where you only fight the bosses of a game or game series. You start out with an unequipped ship and must take down the boss of the first level, King Fossil. Upon defeating King Fossil, you are granted some slight upgrades and proceed directly to the boss of the next level. And so on.</story>

    <story>Darius was Taito&apos;s effort to compete in the arcades against the likes of R-Type and Gradius. Technically impressive, it featured three screens depicting the largest playfield seen in a game so far (the same system was employed for Ninja Warriors), with the player sitting atop a big set of loudspeakers. Visually and audibly, it was a league above Irem&apos;s and Konami&apos;s offerings. When Taito (and others) ported the game to home machines, they were forced to shrink the playfield to fit in one single screen, and re-dubbed it Darius Plus. The plot of Darius involves the two heroes Proco Jr. and Tiat Young fighting the menaces posed by galactic fish and other sea animals again their homeworld. What sets Darius apart from other shoot&apos;em-ups of the time is its way of letting the player choose his path with a certain amount of freedom. At the end of each area (level), you are able to choose between one of two worlds which the area branches into. This renders a higher replay value, since there are many paths to reach the end of the game by. Apart from this, the gameplay is on the simplistic side, both due to unimaginative attack waves and little interaction with the surroundings, but mainly due to the very basic powerup system, which is nowhere near the complexity of the aforementioned R-Type&apos;s and Gradius&apos;.</story>

Using a time machine, they were going to visit the past to find a great place, but their plans were ruined by the evil Gigazombie, who has captured all of Doraemon&apos;s friends and trapped them in different time periods. Now, Doraemon must travel through time to rescue Nobita, Shizuka, Gian, and Suneo from Gigazombie&apos;s henchmen! Meikyu Daisakusen is an action puzzle game viewed from an overhead perspective. Each stage consists of a maze filled with various enemies and items. You must collect all of the keys on the stage to open the exit door while avoiding or eliminating enemies. Your primary method of dealing with enemies is to dig holes; if an enemy walks into a hole, they are momentarily trapped and you can then fill the hole to kill the enemy. You can also obtain temporary weapon powerups such as rayguns and yo-yos, as well as extend your digging reach to dig multiple holes at once. There are also several bosses encountered throughout the game. The game is a conversion of the 1987 Nichibutsu coin-op Kid no Hore Hore Daisakusen, which also saw a modified Famicom version called Booby Kids. An unmodified conversion was released in North America as Cratermaze.</story>

How did this happen? Naturally, because of Nobita, Doraemon&apos;s best friend and geek extraordinaire. Something went wrong when Nobita was showing his friends a time machine, so they ended up stranded in hostile worlds, and now it&apos;s Doraemon&apos;s job to save them! The game is a traditional platformer; Doraemon&apos;s main activities are jumping his way through the levels and eliminating enemies who try to stop him. Doraemon starts with an ordinary gun, but later is able to find other weapons, including a homing bowling ball launcher and a stun gun. He can also collect various power-ups, such as limited invincibility, high speed, an item that freezes all the enemies on the level for a short time, etc. It is possible to switch weapons and power-ups at any time. Doraemon can enter different rooms and caves scattered through the levels. Some of them lead to mini-games (finding a correct way through a maze, memory games, etc.), which, in their turn, lead to significant power-ups, such as an extra life. The game has a symmetrical structure- each &amp;quot;world&amp;quot; is divided into four levels, the last one leading to the boss battle, after which Doraemon travels to another world.</story>

    <story>Double Dungeons is a solo dungeon crawler in the strictest sense. One or two players can explore pseudo-3D, maze-like dungeons (without auto-map feature, but with directions displayed on the screen) and fight the monsters populating them. The player(s) can choose to venture into any of the available 20 dungeons. The dungeons have the same textures, but their layout varies; the higher is the number of the chosen dungeon, the more dangerous are its enemies. Two-player mode features a split screen; the two players start exploring the dungeon from different points. The basic gameplay is very simple. Enemies appear at specific points (they can also re-spawn), and must be defeated in order to proceed. The combat is turn-based at its core, though the turns follow very quickly, and the enemies will attack even if the player does nothing. Attacking is done simply by pressing a button; there are no other combat options. The player can find equipment and healing items (which can also be dropped by enemies). These can be used to restore the player character&apos;s HP outside of battles. Leveling up is completely automatic. There is no narrative in the game; the only story-related information comes in form of very short text intros to the different dungeons, along the lines of the king wants to retrieve a treasure and sends a warrior into the dungeon or comparable mission objectives.</story>

    <story>Nearing the end of the 21th century, human society entered a development stage that was dubbed neo capitalism. Powerful mega-corporations built gigantic computer systems which were able to create entire virtual worlds, where humans sought refuge from the grim reality and the certainty of death. But crime flourished in the cyber world as well; a unit of special agents called cyber divers was created in order to fight criminal organizations. Syd is one of such cyber divers. His companion Ohala was once trapped in the cyber world and never returned. And now, another friend of his, the lovely Deva, tells him that she has been arrested while trying to investigate Ohala&apos;s disappearing. It&apos;s time for Syd to ride his flying bike and get to the bottom of the business - in real world as well as in the dangerous virtual reality. Down Load is a side-scrolling shooter. The player controls Syd on his flying bike, which acts, for all purposes, like other aircrafts in comparable games. Before each mission, the player selects one of the two available main weapons- vulcan cannon (spreading fire, up to five directions if powered-up), and laser beam (powerful, focused fire; beams are added with power-ups). The secondary weapons include homing missiles, a bomb-like gadget, and a shield - all with limited ammunition/energy. The stages include real-world locations as well as abstract computer-like virtual reality worlds, with geometrical figures and computer-related objects as enemies. Boss enemies usually guard the exit to each level, and utilize a variety of shooting patterns to stop the hero. Anime-style cut scenes advance the story between the missions.</story>

Battles are real-time and of the shooter variety, ie, rather than swing a sword, you fire knives (or spells depending on your class).

    <story>The story of this game is rather simple- Tokyo has been destroyed by monsters! Terrifying creatures have invaded the city and ruined it. A scientist who possesses the secret knowledge of psychic powers known as ESP, imbues a young boy with them, and sends him to the streets and underground caverns of Tokyo, to rescue the few remaining survivors, and find out the source of the monstrous invasion! Energy is a side-scrolling shooter. The player manipulates the young hero, who can shoot energy balls and jump. The energy attacks deplete his ESP bar, which refills itself gradually afterwards. The hero&apos;s life bar can only be refilled with healing potions which are sometimes dropped by the enemies. The boy can also collect items which change the properties or his ESP attack, and/or upgrade these attacks to the next level.</story>

    <story>You take the role of a newcomer race driver. Beginning in the Formula 3000, you will have to prove yourself worthy of being promoted to Formula 1 and challenge the best drivers of the late eighties. F-1 Dream is not one of Capcom&apos;s best known games. From a top-down perspective and decorated with cute deformed graphics, it may offer a serious challenge. There are essentially two race instances- first you have to beat the clock in a single lap to qualify for a good position in the race, and second you have to beat your opponents. You also have to keep an eye on your car&apos;s condition, as the tyres and body wear out, so part of your strategy must consider pit stops. Despite its looks, F-1 Dream is not a parody game. Released in 1988, it&apos;s in fact very respectful towards the sport, featuring little details which add realism to it. This includes several real brands advertised in the game, and others which have one or two letters changed in the logo, but are very easy to recognize. So it is with your opponents, featuring the great Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost or Nigel Mansell. The car behavior also features skids when speeding at corners, gears, and damage.</story>

    <story>F1 Circus &apos;91 is a Formula 1 simulation racing game. The series did not yet feature an official license, and so just like the first game it only features generic team and driver names. The game itself plays much the same, with the overhead race view and focus on car tuning and damage. The World Championship mode has of course returned, though the managerial Constructors mode is no longer present. There is also a Free Attack mode, where any course can be freely practiced; a Training mode, where special training courses can be raced on to learn the ins and outs of the game; and a Watch mode, where the player can choose a course and watch a demonstration race.</story>

The game features two power ups which are represented with different colours- weapon upgrades and drones which accompany the player. Those can be upgraded twice each and are compatible to each other. If the player dies, the extras are evacuated into a green capsule. It can be then picked up when using the next life. </story>

The game display is always in split screen mode, even if only one player is playing. The other display shows your nearest rival if you are racing against the computer. There are two basic modes- Grand Prix and Quest. Grand Prix consists of a multi-race points championship. There are two car types for this mode- F-3000 and F1. Grand Prix mode can be played with one or two players. Quest mode has more depth and forms the core of Final Lap Twin. This is essentially a racing RPG. You take the role of a boy who desires to become the World Champion. To do so, you must travel from town to town finding challenges and winning them to gain money and special items to improve your car. As you move around the game world, which is presented in an overhead view, you will encounter random challenges, much like random battles in a traditional RPG.</story>

    <story>Galaga &apos;88 takes the basic gameplay of Galaga and adds higher-quality graphics, triple ship abilities, parsec progression, power-ups, asteroids, bosses and other enhancements. Periodically the player encounters Challenging Stages, which are set to music and feature dancing enemies. The objective is to shoot all 40 enemies before they disappear, for a bonus of at least 10,000 points. There are a total of 29 stages. The player can begin with one ship with two in reserve or start right out with a dual ship (but only one in reserve). Some enemies now have the ability to combine into a much larger single enemy that takes multiple shots to destroy. Others explode in a brilliant shower of fireworks when destroyed, and occasionally these enemies drop a small formation of much smaller enemies that wiggle their way down the screen. Some enemies arrive in spherical eggs and emit a loud, high-pitched noise when hit. These creatures take multiple hits to destroy in flight (just one hit in formation), and their main attack pattern is to move about halfway down the screen, stop, fire multiple shots at once, and then fly straight down off the bottom of the screen. Another type of enemy takes at least five hits to destroy, and it grows larger with each consecutive hit, making it both a larger target and allowing it to act as a shield to other enemies. Later in the game some enemies are equipped with armor that renders them invincible while in formation. When one of these enemies starts its dive, it will flip over and expose its vulnerable side, then flip over again and become invincible while it moves back up the screen, then flip one more time and finish its dive. While vulnerable, this enemy can be destroyed in one hit, scoring bonus points. In addition, many different kinds of obstacles appear throughout the game, including blue crystals, boulders and green blobs.</story>

    <story>In the year 1192, the darkness of the Minamoto clan has come and is spreading across Japan. The country is being ravaged, and only one man of the lost Heike clan can return from the depths of hell to put a stop to it. His name is Taira no Kagekiyo. The story of Genpei Tōma Den ostensibly revolves around the historical Genpei War from Japanese history, and involves Taira no Kagekiyo fighting the evil Minamoto no Yoritomo and the Minamoto clan across Japan. The game features three modes of play- side mode, a small-scale action platforming section; big mode, a large-scale fighting section comparable to the Taito coin-op Gladiator; and flat mode, an overhead-view section. In all three sections the goal is to destroy enemies, collect items, and reach the end before the life bar (represented by burning candles) runs out.</story>

Your ghostly nature also grants you energy-based attacks and several supernatural abilities which are mostly used to take you to surreal stages in which you can levitate and walk on water.</story>

    <story>Based on the legend of the Monkey King, this takes the shoot &apos;em up genre and puts it into a fantastical ancient Chinese setting. Riding on your cloud, you have to fend off oriental spirits and monsters that seem to have taken a dislike for you. Take care though, as one hit and you are dead - sending you back to the last restart point in the level. Helping you on your travels are, of course, the obligatory power-up pods and also an occasional shop where you can purchase such useful powers as a ring of fire and 3-way reverse shots. Also handy is the fact that you can spin around at any time to shoot whatever is creeping up from behind. At varying stages throughout each level you face a boss which must be dispatched to move on. </story>

    <story>Gomola Speed is an action game featuring a robot snake. You must find the pieces of your body strewn about each maze-like stage, which increase your size, and use your length to surround items, food, and enemies in order to eliminate them. You can also use bombs to stun more dangerous enemies. Different stages may have different goals -- for example, you may have to find a key, or use your surround ability on floor tiles to reveal items or enemies. Only your snake&apos;s head is vulnerable; if an enemy hits your body it will scatter all the pieces and you&apos;ll have to collect them again. After completing set conditions on each stage, a door will open that leads to the next stage, at which point you&apos;ll be just a head again, and will have to hunt for your body once more. The game has the same unique UPL style that will be familiar to fans of games such as Atomic Robo-Kid and Mutant Night.</story>

    <story>One day, Hani (sometimes known as Honey), who is a phallic objet d&apos;art from stoneage Japan, is summoned by the god Izanaki. Izanaki is worried because his wife Izanami&apos;s heart has been invaded by a demon. His once peaceful wife now kills thousands of humans each day and threatens to destroy the world that she once created together with her husband. Hani must fly into Izanami&apos;s heart and destroy the demon. Once Hani has entered Izanami&apos;s heart, and you are put in control, it turns into a vertically-scrolling shoot&apos;em up. One button fire the gun, but the other one rotates the gun clockwise, so that you may shoot at enemies coming from any direction. Hani is thus reminiscent of a flying tank. Hani starts out with only one life to spare and a weak weapon, usually giving few minutes of play before game over. However, each enemy shot gives spiritual power to Hani. Pressing the run button puts you in contact with Izanaki, who will let you trade in those power points in exchange for the usual assortment of power-ups, such as multiple shots. Izanaki will also grant you teleportation abilities, so that you may travel back and forth between levels.</story>

    <story>Following on from Hany in the Sky (released the year before), Hany on the Road is a scrolling action game and bears a strong resemblance to Shockway Rider, a game released a few years before on the Spectrum, C64 and Amstrad CPC. You control Hany (or Lemon if you are playing a two player game) who must run the length of the &apos;road&apos; to reach the goal. The road is divided up into four walkways, which you can instantly switch to by pushing up and down on the pad. Depending on the stage, the walkways have various behaviours- some auto scroll, with the faster at the bottom of the screen, others are push-scroll and some even scroll in multiple directions just to shake things up. They are also littered with enemies and obstacles, such as the fiery rocks that rain down from a volcano in the background. Unfortunately for Hany and friend, he&apos;s not blessed with a weapon of any kind, so to protect yourself you have to rely on dodging and jumping to stay alive. There are also plenty of items to collect that give anything from points to lives and some that clear the screen of enemies if you can get to them in time. Once the level is complete, you are on to the next one and are sometimes given a choice of which route to take.</story>

The setting is a hat factory, where hats are dropped down from a conveyor belt two at a time and must be stacked on one of six mannequin heads. Once five hats of the same kind have been stacked on top of each other, they fall down onto another conveyor belt below and are shipped out of the factory, rewarding the player with a cash bonus (the game keeps track of score as money, not simply points). Once you ship out enough hats out of the shop, you go up a level to the next shop. The higher shop number you get to, the more types of hats start appearing to make it more difficult for you to accomplish your task.

The Serds all have single-letter code-names and different specializations- for example, the G-Serd wields a laser sword for devastating melee attacks and can move quickly, while the B-Serd is capable of long-range mortar attacks but has limited movement.

Having more in common with Midway&apos;s Arch Rivals than any sane hockey simulation, this arena is no place for penalties, and no place for wimps. While the idea is still to somehow put the puck into the opposing team&apos;s goal, each team only has three players, there is a heavy focus on checking, and it is possible to do a super shot which is strong enough to send the goalie into the net along with the puck. Available are exhibition and tournament modes for one or two players. Two players can even team up to take on the computer. The TurboGrafx-16 release also adds a four-player mode, while the Gameboy version adds a shot race mode where the player must get a certain number of goals as quickly as possible.</story>

Dodge Danpei is a team dodgeball game, one of several based on the anime and manga created by Tetsuhiro Koshita, which plays strikingly similar to the well-known Super Dodge Ball. Each team has four main players and three support players, and attempts to knock out the opposing team&apos;s main members by throwing the ball at them in various ways. Apart from normal throws, the player can also pass to teammates, and execute special power throws which are harder to dodge or catch. The game includes several different game modes, including the main story mode which follows the story of the anime, as well as one- and two-player exhibition matches. There is also a league mode which allows for a tournament of up to six teams, as well as a training mode where the game teaches the basics of how to play the game.</story>

Your quest takes you over many areas from swamps to caves, and each is populated with the denizens of evil who are all out to get you. To aid you in your fight, there are white two-headed wolves. If you destroy one of these, it releases a power orb which, when collected, boosts your muscle power. These power-ups have two initial stages, with your sprite getting beefier with each one, but once three are collected you transform into a wild and powerful beast. These beasts vary from level to level, but range from a fireball-hurling wolf to a dragon with a powerful electric shock attack.</story>

    <story>Kato &amp; Ken Detective Agency are assigned the task of locating a missing rich man, and you can choose either Kato or Ken to go on the mission. Your partner doesn&apos;t like this one bit, so he decides to make a nuisance of himself along the way. Similar to Adventure Island, you must make your way through several levels, destroying wildlife along the way, but instead of using a hammer, you have three different ways to kill them- jump on or kick them, or when they are walking on the ground, blow gas out of them. While scrolling through the level, your vitality will decrease, but it can be restored by collecting fruit and junk food. During your travels, you will also encounter your partner doing things that shouldn&apos;t be done in public, but sometimes, he will throw stuff at you to make you lose some of your vitality. The only way that you can deal with him is by kicking him where it hurts. Along the way, you can enter doors. Doing this will give you a hint about the level and your vitality will be increased as well. You can kick certain objects such as lamp posts, trashcans, or thin air to obtain coins, or to make hidden platforms appear. Coins can be used in slot machines that will give you extra vitality, more lives, extra coins, and more. Slot machines only appear when you enter certain doors. </story>

    <story>Kattobi! Takuhai-kun (Fury! Delivery Boy) is a top-down action/driving game from Advance Communications Company and Tonkin House. The player is a delivery boy who must make a series of increasingly surreal deliveries across town, occasionally leaving the country and getting into trouble with drug trafficking. As the player complete jobs, they can use their earnings to buy better two-wheeled delivery vehicles, upgrading from a pedal bike to a moped to a state-of-the-art motorcycle. Destroying their vehicle (by losing a life) drops them back down to the regular pedal bike. The game was released exclusively in Japan on the PC Engine. It is perhaps best known to western audiences for its appearance on an episode of the Japanese video game TV show GameCenter CX. </story>

You can move around in eight directions, trying to defend yourself against the attacks of creatures coming from the underworld. You can defend yourself by means of scrolls with obscure magician runes, throwing cards and other weapons to be picked up en route. The magic cards and magic spells have a limited range or last only for a short period of time but can be powered up by collecting the runes found after destroying a formation of red flames-shaped enemies or waving an black and white flag. Several items (mostly pearls) will be found along the way and can be picked up and used to defeat the enemy creatures.

    <story>Knight Rider Special is an action game based on the TV series Knight Rider. It is similar to the NES version, but is played in a third-person perspective. The player takes control over KITT, the speaking car. The main goal of the game is to finish each course within a time limit. However, the presence of other cars and trucks (which may shoot at KITT or are simply in the way) make this difficult. Those can be overcome by either shooting them with one of the build-in weapon systems, jumping over them with the turbo boost or simply passing by. It is also important to keep on the road because ramming against lamp posts is unhealthy. KITT&apos;s abilities can be upgraded during the course of the game.</story>

    <story>In this game, the player takes control of a young nameless traveler. One day, the hero meets a man who tells him a sad story- monsters have kidnapped his granddaughter, and locked her away in a tower. Apparently, the monsters also took away nine other young girls, and have some evil plans in mind. The hero agrees to venture into the tower&apos;s labyrinth and succeed where no other adventurer could... Lady Sword is a first-person solo dungeon crawler. The player navigates the hero through the complex, maze-like corridors of the tower (with an auto-map feature), trying to find the right way to the stairs to the next floor. Fake walls, teleporters, one-way doors, items that must be collected to unlock hidden passages, boss enemies, etc., are there to make this task harder than it looks. Regular enemies pop out randomly, and must be defeated in a very simple turn-based combat. There is no damage feedback for the hero (though the player can see exactly how badly the hero himself is hurt), no weapons, armor, or items for combat usage. The player can heal the hero&apos;s wounds by selecting sleep from the menu. Sleeping restores the hero to full HP; but if he rests too much, a tough demon will appear and attack. Character growth is handled via direct stat increasing; there are no levels, and the hero&apos;s HP, attack and defense power, as well as agility, increase gradually the more he fights. On each floor, a digitized photo of a young woman will greet the hero and encourage the player to explore further - at the stairs to the next floor, should the hero overcome all the obstacles, the player will be able to see the girl naked.</story>

Another difference is that the levels scroll. This is a platformer in which the protagonist needs to collect all gold which is spread out over the levels. Unfortunately there are a lot of enemies roaming around which should be avoided. The protagonist can&apos;t jump and so he needs to resort to ladders and horizontal ropes for dodging. The only way to temporarily get rid of a guard is to make a hole in the ground where they can&apos;t get out when falling in. After a certain amount of time a hole is filled up and a trapped guard respawns.</story>

    <story>Märchen Maze is a platform/shooter game and conversion of Namco&apos;s 1988 arcade game of the same name. The gameplay remains largely the same - the player takes control of Alice who must shoot bubbles at enemies to knock them off platforms. Unlike the arcade original which was in isometric perspective, Märchen Maze on the PC Engine is an overhead game. This version features different stages than the arcade game, and because of the lack of a time limit, many of the stages are much more expansive. The chequered platforms at the end of a level are static rather than moving, hopping on to them automatically takes you to the boss. Also, instead of starting from a checkpoint when you die, your lives are represented by balloons. Should Alice fall, you&apos;ll be respawned on the spot.</story>

    <story>The story of this game is loosely based on the 19th century Japanese epic novel Nanso Satomi Hakkenden (Tale of Eight Dogs) by Kyokutei Bakin. In the game, the player controls a young warrior named Shin. The elder of his home village tells him that a magical artifact known as the Statue of the Four Gods has been stolen. This artifact was sealing away the spirit of the evil Tamazusa. To prevent Tamazusa&apos;s resurrection, Shin must find seven other warriors. Only when they are united can the evil be defeated once and for all... Despite the premise of eight warriors, Makai Hakkenden Shada is an action RPG in which the player controls only Shin. The game is similar to the better-known Ys games in many ways. As in Ys, the hero fights enemies simply by bumping into them. Defeated enemies produce money, which can be spent in villages to purchase weapons and various types of armor, and experience points. Once a set amount of those is accumulated, the hero gains a level. Later in the game Shin receives spells and special techniques, which must be executed actively, by pressing a button. There is also a search command in the game, which is required to use to solve certain situations.</story>

    <story>Makai Prince Dorabocchan is a platformer in which the player takes control over the son of a mighty vampire. Unfortunately he opens a seal which causes monsters to come into the world. Now he needs to cross six levels (each with a boss) while avoiding to lose all life energy. The levels are side-scrolling with horizontal movement involved. Besides dodging by jumping, the player character has two standard ways to deal with enemies- using the unlimited vampire breath (works like a gun) or using tomatoes as bombs which have to be found first. The enemies leave behind various power-ups when killed, e.g. energy, extra lives or armor.</story>

    <story>Märchen Maze is a platform/shooter game and conversion of Namco&apos;s 1988 arcade game of the same name. The gameplay remains largely the same - the player takes control of Alice who must shoot bubbles at enemies to knock them off platforms. Unlike the arcade original which was in isometric perspective, Märchen Maze on the PC Engine is an overhead game. This version features different stages than the arcade game, and because of the lack of a time limit, many of the stages are much more expansive. The chequered platforms at the end of a level are static rather than moving, hopping on to them automatically takes you to the boss. Also, instead of starting from a checkpoint when you die, your lives are represented by balloons. Should Alice fall, you&apos;ll be respawned on the spot.</story>

    <story>The game is based on famous Japanese folk tales. Momotarou is a boy who was found in a huge peach (hence his name, peach guy). When he grows up, he goes to the island of demons, fights them, takes their treasure, and restores peace in its village. In this game, you don&apos;t play directly the story of Momotarou, but control three other popular characters from Japanese folklore, playing three separate stories- as Yashahime, the daughter of the Hell King Emma; Binbougami, or poverty god, who is hated by people because he takes money from them; and Urashima, the legendary fisherman who once saved a turtle and became friends with the dragon clan. Although the original stories have nothing or little to do with each other or the story of Momotarou, the game ties the stories together by featuring Momotarou as a character in every one of them. Despite being primarily a game for kids (the story is told in a fairy-tale fashion), this is a full-fledged console-style RPG with levels, party management, world map traveling, dungeons, towns, weapons and armors, and turn-based combat against randomly appearing enemies, viewed from first person perspective.</story>

    <story>The sequel to Momotaro Densetsu continues its story, which is based on an old Japanese folk tale. Momotarou is a boy who was found by an old couple inside a giant peach. When he grew up, he found three faithful companions - a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant, and with their help defeated the evil demons of the Demon Island. Three years have passed since. Momotarou and his friends do not suspect that deep beneath the Demon Island there lies a palace, in which resides Emma, the King of Hell. Unable to accept the victory of the humans over the demons, Emma sends his three most terrifying demonic servants to challenge the humans once again. It looks that Momotarou&apos;s adventure wasn&apos;t over, after all... Like the first game, this is an oldschool Japanese RPG with simple gameplay mechanics. Moving Momotarou over the world map, you visit towns, talk to people, buy weapons, and fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat viewed from first person perspective.</story>

Later, the boy decided to rid the land of the evil demon tribe. Help Momotarou to reach the Demon Island and to defeat the demons! Gameplay-wise and graphically, this is a typical Momotarou RPG- navigating the little hero through the rop-down world map, you visit towns, descend into dungeons, equip Momotarou with weapons and armor, buy items, and fight random enemies and monsters in turn-based combat viewed from first person perspective.</story>

    <story>Moto Roader II is a racing game shown in a top-down perspective. Five vehicles compete on a course with the goal to finish first. However, the screen always follows the leading vehicle and if a vehicle is left behind, it gets replaced on the current screen. Every vehicle has a fuel counter which gets a penalty if the vehicle is hit or needs to be replaced. Reaching zero ends the race. Players can choose between three vehicles which drive differently (car, tank or hovercraft) and, if they have gathered enough prize money, can upgrade it between races (including weapons). In contrast to the predecessor, the game has a futuristic look.</story>

    <story>Long time ago, the Gods fought the Demons in a cosmic battle. To ensure victory, the Gods had to sacrifice part of their divine nature, and forge a weapon that had both good and bad in it - the Evil Holy Sword Necromancer. The demons were forced to dwell in the lower world, while the Gods remained in the heaven. Between these two worlds lies the world of humans. But the demons did not accept this plan for co-existence. They have murdered the king of the human continent Ishumeria, and it&apos;s time for the nameless hero of this story to seek out the legendary sword Necromancer, and restore balance in the world. Jaseiken Necromancer plays like a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game- top-down navigation, linear story progression, turn-based battles against randomly appearing enemies, automatic leveling up, etc. A somewhat unusual (for the time) feature is the player&apos;s ability to choose two companions for the hero among six possible ones. These warriors are introduced to the hero after he accepts his quest, and the player can build a party of three, trying to balance between physical and magical skills they possess. The game is also notable for its rather dark themes, uncommon for the representatives of its genre at that time. Enemies mostly include demonic creatures, and their death animation contains graphical gore.</story>

    <story>Necros no Yōsai is based on the characters from the eponymous Japanese toy line from the 1980s. The story tells of a world known as Tankirie, which was conquered by the evil warlock Necros; however, eight heroes (Knight, Mage, Amazon, Samurai, Elf, Dwarf, Berserker, and Mercenary) defeated him and restored peace. The game is divided into chapters; in the first one, the player takes control of the Mercenary, who is separated from his companions and is looking for a job. A search for a girl&apos;s missing father leads him to more dangerous discoveries, and eventually he has to reunite with his friends in order to face the evil once again. The player controls the Mercenary in the first chapter, but plays as other heroes as well (up to an active party of three) later in the game. The game is structured like a traditional top-down Japanese-style RPG, with random enemies and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Stand-out feature of the game are animated attacks- every attack in battle is presented as a short animated sequence, separate from the battle screen. Unlike most other RPGs of the time, Necros no Yōsai does not feature a freely explorable world map. Instead, player-controlled characters move in a strictly linear fashion to icons that represent towns and hostile areas. </story>

    <story>Military Madness is a futuristic turn-based strategy war game. The year is 2089 and the setting is Earth’s moon, which yields many important resources. While the governments of Earth bicker over their staked claims on the moon, the evil Axis Empire launches a lunar military campaign and takes over the moon, using its factories to produce advanced weaponry, the most devastating of which is the SAM (Supreme Atomic Missile). As commander of the Allied forces, it is the player’s responsibility to lead what’s left of the Allied armies in a desperate offensive against the Axis Empire on the lunar surface before they can use the SAM to destroy Earth. There are 32 maps (2 different campaigns with 16 maps each) to play through. In each map, the player must strategically defeat the outnumbering Axis forces either by destroying all enemy units or capturing the enemy base camp. There are many different units that both sides utilize - infantry, tanks, aircraft, artillery, and a few others that have specialized functions. Gameplay consists of moving units into positions that will gain the best advantage to attack the enemy, capitalizing on many factors, which include battle experience, terrain, support tactics, and - sometimes - pure luck.</story>

Or you can challenge a friend in Versus mode and go head to head with whatever teams you choose. Or, if you just feel like cutting loose, you can play Bean Ball mode which is just a free-for-all every-man-for-himself romp in the school yard. Be the last man standing. You can play this alone or with a friend, but the computer will control the remaining 4-5 players.</story>

    <story>This soccer game was made at the time when Nintendo introduced their four player adapter, and was probably made for the four playing purpose. This is shown clearly when you choose to play 2 or more players. Then you can choose between many different ground layers, like ice, grass and stone, which adds to the replayability. When you play a one player game you play the world cup as one of the top soccer countries of that time, and you meet countries in a fixed order. Cameroon in the first match and the final is against West Germany. In an old-school fashion you lose when you play a draw, there&apos;s no extra time whatsoever. In the game you always steer only one character, which you choose before the match starts. You can then give simple orders to you team-mates, like pass, tackle and shoot. Your moves are also limited to these moves. The game is totally lawless, so feel free to make elbow tackles without a wink from the referee. Probably it was made this way to be funnier to play against friends.</story>

You must explore the land, descend to the dangerous labyrinths, retrieve the eight medallions, rescue the princess, and defeat Dirth. Very similar to the famous Zelda games, Neutopia is Turbo Grafx&apos; answer to Nintendo&apos;s king of action adventures. You roam freely the vast land, fighting many different monsters in wilderness areas as well as in dungeons. Dungeons also require some puzzle-solving (pushing stones, blowing walls with bombs, etc.). The game has a slight RPG flavor, allowing you to power-up by collecting various items, and equip different weapons and armor.</story>

    <story>Some years have passed since the brave hero Jazeta destroyed Dirth, the Emperor of Darkness. Peace has returned to the land of Neutopia. But there are still monsters roaming the countryside, and some of them were spotted near Yurius Shrine. Jazeta went there to find out what exactly had happened. But he didn&apos;t return... You are Jazeta&apos;s son, and you must first of all find your missing father! Can it be that the shadow of Emperor of Darkness threatens the peaceful land again?.. The sequel to Neutopia is similar to the predecessor in every way. Navigating your hero from a top-down view, you explore the vast countryside, fighting monsters in real time combat. The game is not a true RPG, but an action adventure- you don&apos;t gain any experience points from combat, only collect money to buy supplies. In dungeons, you must use bombs on walls to reveal secret passages, push stones, and fight many regular enemies and bosses.</story>

    <story>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. If Tiki doesn&apos;t rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</story>

Like the book, the game portrays the struggle between the Northern Court, ruled by the decadent Hōjō clan (later betrayed by their vassal Ashikaga Takauji), and the Southern Court of the emperor Go-Daigo. The gameplay has strong grand strategy elements and is similar to Koei&apos;s historical simulation series. The player can choose to control either the Northern or the Southern forces, choosing the actions for the leader and all his vassals. The player can choose to engage in diplomacy with rulers of other provinces, sign agreements, and manage and navigate armies. Combat takes place on a separate top-down grid, on which he player navigates the soldiers in turn-based fashion. Individual battles proceed automatically, their outcome based on the participant&apos;s attributes.</story>

    <story>Obviously designed as a game for younger children, you choose between three animal characters to play and must guide them across each level, collecting fruit to feed to the dragon at the end. Gameplay is simple, mostly involving jumping or ducking to avoid enemies - there is no attack. During the level the timer slowly decreases, however levels are quite short so this is to encourage children to keep moving, rather than provide any sort of challenge. Along the way you will encounter doors - some of these contain sliding block puzzles to solve, others have animated pictures of characters that talk to you. Enemies are mostly slow moving, some can be used to reach higher fruit, others are static and require timing to dodge (such as the elephants who lift their trunks for you to pass). </story>

    <story>Ninja Gaiden begins with a cinematic animation in which two ninjas duel to the death; one goes down. It is revealed that the doomed ninja is the father of Ryu Hayabusa. When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu&apos;s father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world. In comparison to the better known console version this game is a traditional fighting game similar to Double Dragon in which the player walks from left to right while battling numerous enemies. Only if all foes are dispatched of, the player can advance in the level. It&apos;s also possible to perform special attacks and use weapons. The latter are either collectable power-ups or environmental objects like phone boots. Ryu can attack his enemies using his his bare hands and feet or using a sword (for a limited time). He can also perform moves such as a flying neck throw, a back flip and hang kicks, performed while hanging in scenario objects. Throwing enemies against objects such as phone cabins, oil drums or dumpsters will destroy them, revealing power ups such as health items and swords. At some points, Ryu will have to perform acrobatic moves to carry on. He has a life bar starting with five units. The game takes place in United States&apos; locations such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in those stages are mostly of the same five kinds, including Jason Vorhees&apos; look-alikes and other masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of each stage. A two-player co-operative game is also featured. Whenever the player dies, a continue screen will appear showing Ryu chained to a table while a circular saw descends upon him.</story>

There are also power ups to collect, e.g. weapon upgrades or summoning an ally which supports him through the rest of the stage.

Through a series of missions, you&apos;ll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day? Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped rail-shooter, where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to pick them up. Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. You&apos;ll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it&apos;s not beneficial. Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</story>

    <story>A very important discovery was recently made on the planet Laffra - ancient ruins at an excavation site, containing relics of another civilization, with technique that would surely benefit the great intergalactic Empire. But a mysterious organization that calls itself Mars began to stir unrest on the planet. The head of Imperial Scouts sends the hero, piloting a combat robot known as FW, into the depths of the ruins, to face the enemies and retrieve the precious knowledge... Out Live is a solo dungeon crawler; unlike most representatives of this genre, it is set in a sci-fi environment, and the player controls a giant robot rather than a medieval warrior. Most of the enemies are also machines and robots of different kinds. Before venturing into the dungeon, the player has access to various shops, where it is possible to repair the robot, buy weapons, protective shields, and items that restore the robot&apos;s energy. Most of the gameplay takes place in pseudo-3D, maze like underground complexes (without an auto-map, but with a compass feature). There, the game plays similarly to other dungeon crawlers- random enemies must be fought in turn-based fashion; they drop money and award the player character with experience points. A somewhat unusual feature is double leveling- the robot has two independent levels, for attack and for defense. The experience points the robot receives after battles also come in two different flavors. Depending on the enemy type and outcome of the battle, the robot receives different amounts of experience. The leveling-up itself is automatic, increasing maximum energy, attack and defense parameters.</story>

    <story>Bonk&apos;s Adventure is a prehistoric platform game where you are in control of a large bald headed caveman, guiding him through the levels taking out all manner of strange prehistoric creatures that get in your way including King Drools henchmen - all in effort to free the captured/controlled residents of Moonland (bosses) - including the Princess Za from King Drool attempted take over. The game is not unlike other platform games of the era. Though it&apos;s unique in that you can climb walls and swing on rope with your teeth and your only method of attack is head butting enemies - straight forward or dive bomb style. The game starts off with simplistic point A to point B style, but focuses more on exploration in the later stages, which include finding hidden bonus areas. The game is also known for its trademark gameplay mechanism of &apos;spin attack&apos;, where Bonk floats through the air if you have the turbo button on. This can be used to float around the level and reach areas for extra/hidden items, but also as a method of attack as well. The game starts you off with 3 hearts, but allows you to increase this number when you find special heart container items, allowing Bonk to take a number of hits before dying. A variety of bonus stages can be found throughout the game, which provide bonus points upon completion and thus resulting in accumulating extra lives. Enemies themselves can be &apos;milked&apos; for points in that you can keep &apos;bonking&apos; their dead bodies and not letting them hit the ground. Spin attack is another method for doing this.</story>

    <story>Bonk has his revenge on King Drool III in his second game for the TurboGrafx. It&apos;s not exactly clear why Bonk is so vengeful, but it appears that King Drool is responsible. Bonk uses his over-sized cranium as a lethal weapon in this sequel. The gameplay in this adventure is very similar to the first game. Bonk has head-butting, head-stomping, and fire-breathing moves when he eats some spicy meat.</story>

    <story>Bonk&apos;s Big Adventure is the third instalment in the side-scrolling platformer series. As in previous games, the player assumes the role of a caveman named Bonk who headbutts his way through various enemies in order to defeat King Drool. Familiar moves include swinging on trees, bouncing off walls, breaking blocks and climbing walls with his teeth. Compared to the previous games, he walks and moves a little faster. Bonk has the new ability to pick up red and blue candy power-ups that make him grow or shrink and grab a flower copter. As always, there is plenty of platforming and enemies to discover. The game consists of seven rounds, set in the Dinosaur Kingdom, finished off with a boss. At the end of each stage, 16 smileys can be exchanged to play up to eight different bonus stages (2 smileys per stage needed). New level elements include ziplines and sewer pipes. The game also features a cooperative multiplayer mode.</story>

    <story>You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest. To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god. Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness. Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not. To get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on. The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same. When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero. He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy. When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy&apos;s people. He will burn; he will kill. And he won&apos;t stop until they&apos;re all dead... or he is. But you don&apos;t have to let your people have all the fun; the god&apos;s have other tools as well. You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers. Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland. Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn&apos;t build on high-ground. And when you win, you&apos;ll have 500 more worlds to conquer. A god&apos;s play is just never done.</story>

You’ll need to place third or higher to continue to the next stage. Be careful not to bump into other buggies or objects next to the road. While you’re buggy can take a pounding, crashing will slow you down. Finish all 5 stages in a level and you’ll be presented with a bonus level.</story>

    <story>Power Eleven is a top-down soccer game with three playing modes- multiplayer, penalty kicks (shown from the back of the transparent goalkeeper) and a tournament mode. The latter is the main mode for solo players and features twelve national soccer teams. Then the player needs to defeat the other teams with rising difficulty to win the Hudson Cup. Regarding rules, the game features no fouls or off-sides. Each athlete has a rating in the five statistics (run, dribble, kick, technique and power) which influences his performance on the field. The player can also choose between different formations and after successful matches athletes can be substituted. The most unusual aspect of the game is the power rating which is lowered when using the power mode which allows faster movement and forceful shots. However, the power does only get completely refilled after a match so it needs to be used with care. Because the activation of this mode takes up a button, there is no dedicated passing button to be found. The distance of a shot is chosen by pressing the fire button quickly or holding it. </story>

The Edit mode allows the player to change the starting lineup and starting rotation for the team. The teams are bracketed in two groups- South Division (consisting of teams from Bangkok, Beijing, Moscow, Paris, Rome, Sidney); North Division (counting teams based in Chicago, Los Angeles, London, New York, Tokyo, Toronto).

    <story>Pro Tennis World Court game with a twist. The action itself features no big surprises- the players control their characters over the scrolling tennis field and try to counter balls from their opponents. It is possible to perform typical tennis actions like cross, smash or lob and the hit performance depends on the timing. However, the unique feature of this game is a story mode which takes various elements from Japanese role-playing games. The story involves an evil king who banned all tennis matches outside of membership courts. The player goes out to overthrow the king so tennis can be brought back to everyone. So the player explores a top-down world map reminiscent of Dragon Warrior, explores the surrounding and fights enemies. Those fights are either random encounters or scripted boss battles and play out as regular tennis matches. The overall goal is to find all membership courts and defeat the inhabitants. Because of this, the game does not end when defeated; the player gets dragged to the king and has to pay a penalty fee. Money is the only resource and is earned by defeating enemies. It is used to buy updated equipment- shoes improve speed, rackets improve power and shirts help to evade random encounters. The game is no RPG, however, because there is no actual character development.</story>

    <story>Puzzle Boy is a port of the Game Boy title Kwirk, but features more and different levels along with changed graphics. In contrast to the original version, the perspective is straight top-down and there is no undo-function. However, regarding gameplay this is still a Soko-Ban variant. The player finds himself in a maze and needs to find the way to the exit. The obstacles on the way are boxes which can be pushed but not pulled, holes and revolving doors. The game features three playing modes, most notably the level mode with 100 levels. They are divided over four sets of 20 each. Those sets have a difficulty level associated with them and each rewards the same ending when solved. The other two modes are the challenge mode (solving ten levels in a limited amount of time) and a split-screen multiplayer mode.</story>

    <story>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy. There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example) The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.</story>

    <story>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot &apos;em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay. You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire. The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called The Force, which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements). The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger&apos;s artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot&apos;em&apos;ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type&apos;s contemporary rival, Gradius.</story>

    <story>The royal family of Bunnyland was kidnapped by monsters and the player has to save them by beating all six levels of this side-scrolling shooter. The reason why the protagonist, a rabbit, can fly is the rocket launcher on his back. Just like in most shooters, the main objective is to survive the way to the end boss of each level without getting hit by enemies (three hits result in a life loss). The rabbit has three ways to defend itself- a regular gun, a strong melee punch and limited homing missiles. The power ups are shield energy refreshments, extra points, invincibility, more missiles and missile upgrades.</story>

    <story>Racing Damashii is a motorcycle racing game with six courses. It is basically action-oriented, but the player needs to watch the damage of the motorcycle (decreases with crashes) and the tire condition (decreases when leaving the road). If one of the two bars runs out, the race is over, but repairs are conducted during pit stops. The two playing modes for single-player are training races and a championship in which points are awarded for good end positions. Those can be reinvested into motorcycle upgrades. The perspective is 3D with the camera fixed behind the player&apos;s vehicle.</story>

A pilot must take control of the experimental fighter to destroy the alien warships that just happen to look like odd variations of typical military tanks and planes with gadgets attached to them. Raiden (called Raiden Trad on the Genesis and SNES) is an over-head vertical-scrolling shooter, based on an arcade game of the same title. It features two forms of weapon upgrades and two types of missiles (normal or homing). You start the game with several bombs which you can use to destroy most enemies on the screen to get yourself out of a jam. Each level ends with a large boss or bosses.</story>

A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.

    <story>Due to mysterious circumstances, a flourishing city called Chany&apos;s Hill was cut off the rest of the world. Investigators found out that most of the buildings were destroyed, horrifying creatures are roaming the wilderness, and the few survivors have no means of escaping. The SSWAT (Supernatural Special Weapon Attack Team) sends an agent named Laila to the city. The young woman has powerful psychic abilities, which can enhance her firearms, helping her deal with the monsters. She must rescue the survivors and escort them to safety, at any cost... Shiryo Sensen - War of the Dead is an action role-playing game. The player navigates Laila over the top-down world map (the ruined city has basically turned into large wilderness areas with a few buildings that are equivalent to dungeons in other RPGs), fighting randomly appearing enemies. The battles take place on separate side-scrolling screens, and are fully action-based. Laila can jump, duck, and attack with melee or ranged weapons. Typically there are several enemies on the screen; Laila escapes the battle if she reaches the end of the short side-scrolling area. Enemies leave orbs of various colors and chests upon defeat; these serve to heal Laila, grant her experience points, mind points, or ammunition for the firearms. Laila starts with a knife and a pistol, but later gains access to more powerful firearms. These weapons can be enhanced with Laila&apos;s psychic techniques, which, in their turn, require mind points.</story>

Those boxes have to pushed into certain places of the level which are marked. However, the player character can only push a box; pulling is out of the question. This means it is possible to create a dead end by pushing a box in the wrong way. If that happens, the undo function can be used to take back the last steps. </story>

    <story>Three girls have been reported missing including the mayor&apos;s daughter, and Chase Special Investigations has asked you to track down five vehicles, mentioned in the mission briefing, who are believed to be involved in the kidnapping. Using a heavy-designed machine with a V6 DOHC 3000CC Twin Turbo Engine, five sets of nitro-fuel boosts, and a gun attached to the steering wheel (which you can use to damage the target vehicle), your mission is to patrol the streets and find these vehicles. The gameplay is similar to Chase H.Q., but there are a few differences. For example, cars travel in both directions instead of one, and some of them will catch up to your car and shoot at you. At least once in every stage a helicopter does a fly by and drops you some grenades you can use to further damage the target vehicle. A guy on a motorcycle will catch up to you and throw grenades at your car. And, most importantly, as mentioned earlier, you can shoot at the target vehicle rather than just bumping into it. Have fun driving around, but remember, there is a strict time limit, so I wouldn&apos;t waste time or keep crashing into things if I were you.</story>

Several weapons are at Rick&apos;s disposal throughout the house, such as a meat cleaver, a two by four, and a shotgun.

    <story>The board game Stratego is a more elaborate version of Capture the Flag. Each player starts with 40 pieces; made up by the flag, 5 bombs, and an assortment of 9 types of military units. After these have been placed, each player takes it in turn to move their pieces. Other than scouts (which are the least powerful) the units can only move one space at a time.The flag and bombs can&apos;t be moved during the game, so watch out for any squares the computer does not move when it otherwise logically should, and these could be your goal. When you choose a square occupied by an opposition piece, combat arises, and the higher-numbered piece is lost from the game. You have no way of knowing what strength the opposition pieces are until you have hit them. This computerized interpretation has 3 different board layouts, a selection of automatic setups with different strategic benefits, and a demo mode.</story>

    <story>The game is based on the eponymous manga (sometimes transliterated as Susa no Oh) by Go Nagai. The protagonist is a seemingly ordinary teenager named Susa, who discovers that he contains within himself another persona, the destructive Japanese god Susanoo. The game&apos;s story begins right where the manga ended (with a cliffhanger)- Susa faces his rival Uryu, who causes him to unleash the power of Susanoo, devastating the world and releasing evil spirits that take it in their possession. Having returned to his normal self, Susa has to find his sweetheart Yukishiro and other friends, and figure out a way to undo the damage he has inflicted on the world. Susanoo Densetsu is notable for implementing a setting and gameplay themes unusual for Japanese RPGs of its time. Among those is a day/night cycle, which influences the appearance of monsters on the world map as well as schedules of characters in the towns (for example, shops are closed at night). It is also one of the first Japanese RPGs in which enemies wander around visibly on the world map, sometimes surrounding the player, Ultima-style, and can be avoided. The battle system is also reminiscent of Ultima, featuring free movement on the top-down battle screen. The fights are held in fast-paced turn-based style; to pause the fight, the player has to bring up the menu and select a command. Similarly to Emerald Dragon, action points are spent when moving and/or selecting commands. Later in the game Susa teams up with two other characters; he can also recruit mercenaries to help him in battles. Characters learn the so-called ESP powers when leveling up, which are equivalent to magic spells.</story>

New Adventure Island is a one-player action game that consists of seven areas, with four rounds each. In order to get through the areas, you must use your hatchet to destroy wildlife such as frogs, spiders, birds, snails, insects, and other pests, and watch out for hazards such as rocks, fire, water, and pits. As you progress further, your vitality will get low, so fruit must be collected in order to restore it. Along the way, you can smash open eggs that will award you with better weapons that include boomerangs, arrows, and magical fire. Some of the eggs will also reveal a fairy, which will protect you from getting hit. If you are unlucky enough to find an eggplant hidden in one of these eggs, your vitality will drain away very fast, and you need to get fruit every five seconds in order to survive.

Originating in the arcades, Truxton is a vertically scrolling shooter. The player controls a fighter craft that has to eliminate the enemies with primary weapons or bombs. The basic weapon comes in three varieties- Power Shot (small spreading projectiles), Sun Laser (a powerful, fast-moving straight laser beam, and Truxton Beam (an electric beam that spreads in all directions if the player is holding down the fire button). Each one of these weapons can be upgraded to a more powerful variant by collecting power-ups (up to four power levels). Beside increased attack power, the weapons also may gain additional properties when powering up (e.g. the Power Shot creates a shield around the player-controlled aircraft). Other power-up effects include increasing the ship&apos;s maneuvering speed up to four times, increasing the number of bombs, and gaining additional lives.</story>

But while Ghouls &apos;n&apos; Ghosts is visually interesting and has great music, this isn&apos;t and doesn&apos;t. Graphics are plain, though not as simplistic as a lot of games of this type and therefore moderately attractive, sound is average with nothing that sticks in your head, but there&apos;s something about the difficulty that just puts you off. Most games have a learning curve that starts off very easy then ramps up, but this is pretty tricky from the beginning. After the first few levels, you&apos;ll soon be cursing the screen and reaching for the power switch. It almost has a furious addictiveness to it, but not quite - the drive to get further is somehow missing. If you like very hard and annoying platformers, then you could do worse, but most people won&apos;t be willing to put the effort in as the rewards are just not there.</story>

    <story>Titan is a 2D arcade game / puzzle game hybrid. For some reason, mad professors of the future tend to invent strange entertainment games in which every participant dies. Professor Hybrys’ variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in a direction of your choice. The labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game speed can be slowed down by holding the space key – a very useful option in tricky situations. Titan mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels). The challenge is to control the sphere accurately, yet indirectly.</story>

    <story>Tiger Road is a beat &apos;em up in which you (as Lee Wong) must rescue the village children from the evil Ryo Ken Oh. Many levels are horizontally scrolling, although with high ledges to jump onto and follow for a slightly different path. Magic urns containing improved weapons appear frequently. Most enemies are easy to attack and only need one hit to kill, although they come at you in large hordes. Once you get to the indoor sections you will find big enemies with the ability to kill you with one hit, in sections set on multiple levels complete with stairways.</story>

    <story>This is a remake of the original game. The story still&apos;s the same- Ishtar sends Gilgamesh up the 60 maze levels of the Druaga&apos;s tower to rescue Ki and retrieve the Blue Crystal Rod. He must find each level&apos;s key to proceed to the next one. Besides the updated graphics, this remake features a 3/4 view instead of the original top-down one. It also bears some RPG elements, as Gilgamesh gathers experience points for killing enemies, which are spent at the end of each level, to improve his stats (such as speed, health, etc.). He&apos;ll also find equipment such as swords, helmets, armors, shields, gauntlets and boots, which can be changed to better his stats, and will also find special items in hidden chests. The way to find theses chests is different for each floor. There are new treasures and new enemies. The game also features four different difficulty levels (easy, normal, hard and pro), as well as a password feature.</story>

Exhibition and league matches are on offer, with the opportunity to recreate a full league season with 1 player assigned to each of the 28 clubs. The game uses varying camera positions, with top-down views when the ball is close to either hoop, and a side-view when the ball is mid-court - controls remain unchanged for these, so the switch doens&apos;t cause a sudden change in player movement. As well as playing the matches you have full coaching control. This can involve making substitutions but also assigning marking and game strategies.</story>

Cutscenes follow dramatic moments in the match, and each match is preceded by a TV-style introduction. The game is primarily action-based, although you also choose your plays before executing them. You then bring the passes and runs to life on the pitch itself. You can play single matches or full leagues, with any of the NFL teams of the time.</story>

    <story>Cinemaware&apos;s TV Sports series got an exclusive entry on the TurboGrafx-16 with this hockey game. The game offers exhibition matches and a tournament mode, eight international teams (each with unique player statistics), and support for up two five players via the TurboTap. After a dramatic close-up of the face-off, actual game play is seen from a top-down perspective with a vertically scrolling field. Every player (including the goalie) can be controlled. On offense, quick shots, slap shots and even faked slap shots are possible. On defense, body checking an opposing player can lead to a special fight sequence. Exhibition games can be played with either full or easy rules - easy mode has less penalties and infractions like offside. In tournaments, every scheduled game can either be played or the results simulated. Tournament progress is saved via a password. When two or more players play, they can be put on any team. Thus teams featuring five human players are just as possible as mixed competitive matches.</story>

    <story>Takin&apos; it to the Hoop is a basketball game with comic graphics. The player either participates in a league, play-offs or a single match and chooses one of eight American teams with twelve athletes. The team&apos;s performance during a match does not only depend on the player&apos;s ability but also on the athlethe&apos;s statistics (e.g. agility or dribbling) and their energy. Energy decreases during the course of a match and describes how much power an athlete has left. There are also three different defense tactics (one-on-one defense, zone defense or a mix between the two) which can be set before the match or during interceptions. During the matches, the player controls the ball carrier when in offense and manually switches between athletes when in defense. Passes can be performed in a high or low variation. While most of the match is shown in a slightly heightened side-scrolling perspective, the game switches to a close-up view during a penalty throw or a dunking try. Here the player needs to press a button at the correct timing for a successful throw. When a defense athlete is nearby during a during maneuver, he has the opportunity to block the ball when the correct timing is met.</story>

    <story>In the year 2324, Earth is in no good shape- alien forces attacked the planet since three years. But now the military unleashed their secret weapon, the fighting robots Veigues, to set an end to this threat! The player controls one of those robots through ten stages in which a lot of aliens and a big boss want to be defeated. This is a traditional run and gun game in which the player dodges enemy attacks and uses a variety of weapons which are built in the robot&apos;s body parts. It is also possible to float for a short amount of time, but this costs energy which is displayed in one of the two automatically regenerating status bars at the bottom of the screen. The other one shows the condition of the protective shields which are decreased by enemy hits. If it runs out, the robot loses a limb and associated systems, e.g. if the head is gone, the radar which shows the direction of incoming attacks goes with it. If all limbs are lost, the game is over. Defeating enemies rewards points which can be used to upgrade the robot&apos;s abilities between levels.</story>

    <story>Volfied is a home conversion of an arcade coin-op developed by Taito in the late &apos;80s. The game is very similar to Qix -- the player takes control of an object whose purpose is to roam the screen, forming shapes and removing them from the play field. By way of reward, a picture is gradually revealed in the removed areas of the screen. The borders of the area which the player has not cleared become the border of the area the player&apos;s pointer can move along. The player&apos;s object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers limit which parts of the border boxes can be formed through. The goal is to clear 80% or more of the screen, and each additional percent adds bonus points. As an arcade conversion this game allows for one or two player games in three difficulty levels, but offers no passwords or saved games across its numerous levels.</story>

The second athlete can also be played by a second human player. The controls offer no surprises- players move an athlete over the field and use two buttons for jumping and hitting. Single players also have to switch between the two athletes. However, each athlete has a n energy value which decreases over the course of a match. By using a water bottle the energy gets filled up again, but there is only a limited amount available. When using the training mode instead of the tournament, players can choose between one of three fields and an easy mode which is basically a slow motion mode.</story>

    <story>Xevious- Fardraut Saga is a vertically scrolling shooter and another installment in the Xevious series which started in 1982 when Xevious was introduced in arcade halls. The story of Xevious- FS is that a large number of UFOs have been reported above the South American continent. The player&apos;s duty is to reconnoiter the identity of the unidentified objects and the underground building located at 72.26. The Recon squadron has been mashed up to the last Solvalou. Moreover, we succeeded in developing a transformed type named Gampmission. That is basically a combination of three fighters which are Solvalou, Solgrado and Zeodalley. By introducing this new machine we obtained the sinews of war which is needed in order to counteract increased enemy power. Now the battlefield of the Xevious army has been extended. Thus, we are in a critical condition. We will start operation of mash the Xevious army. Good Luck.</story>

    <story>Tarosuke has died and now must cross the purgatory as depicted in Buddhist lore, fighting enemies and advancing in his path towards ultimate redemption. Depending on just how well he behaves in this afterlife you can see up to 5 different endings, which involve everything from re-incarnation to eternal damnation in hell. The game plays as a side-scrolling action platform, in which you control Tarosuke as he jumps around the game-world avoiding pitfalls and other traps. Enemies can be defeated by the use of a ki-based projectile attack and, once defeated, monsters leave behind money which can be exchanged in-game for health and other unique power-ups. Bosses are based on several Buddhist tales; being much too powerful for Tarosuke, he must invoke his guardian spirit to defeat such demons, which involves finding a shrine and praying until it is summoned.</story>

Events can either be positive or negative, mostly influencing your account balance. In the course of the game, players will take on a profession, marry and might get children. The game ends when every player reaches the retirement phase. The player who is wealthiest by then wins the game.</story>

    <story>Zero4 Champ is a racing simulation game inspired by Japanese urban street racing, its name derived from the traditional racing distance (0 to 400 meters). A versus mode allows players to compete against each other or computer AI in first-person-view races; however, the game&apos;s main mode is the Story Mode, which has strong simulation elements. The player takes the role of a young racer, competing in tournaments and gradually advancing in rank. It is possible to buy car parts or whole vehicles, as well as customize cars. Money is obtained from prizes or by doing part-time jobs. These jobs are sometimes designed as mini-games; for example, working as a security guard involves inspecting rooms in a first-person environment. It is also possible to play simple arcade games such as UFO catcher or Turbo Racing.</story>
