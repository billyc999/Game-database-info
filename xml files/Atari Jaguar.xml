    <story>AirCars takes place in the future after a nuclear holocaust. The large organization E.B.N.E.R.S. is plotting to take over the world and has developed advanced forcefield and teleportation systems, and nuclear powered AirCars. To stop the plot, your group steals plans, builds its own AirCar, and sets out to destroy all of the bases, 28 known and countless unknown ones, stationed around the globe. You can choose to play a single player game, the 2-player game using a JagLink, or up to 8 players using ICD&apos;s CatBoxes. On screen and on radar, each player&apos;s AirCar is displayed in a different color to help identify the good guys from the bad guys. There are 3 difficulty settings. You will be using the cockpit&apos;s instrument panel to fly the AirCar, select weapons and view radar, as well as combating the enemy in the air and shooting ground targets. Features include true 3D sound, a computer voice (which can be turned off if desired), and music during the introduction and level intermissions.</story>

    <story>The Jaguar version of Alien vs. Predator is completely different from the Arcade and SNES games of the same name. The Jaguar version takes place entirely on a Colonial Marine Training base. A ship infested with Aliens is found floating near the outer-space training facility. Of course, once the Aliens get inside the base, they kill off nearly everyone. Meanwhile, the Predators dock their ship on the training base as well. They see this as an opportunity to catch an Alien Queen, and bring honor to their clan. So there are three scenarios in which to play- First, you can play as a Marine. Your job is to find a way to self-destruct the base, and make your way to an escape pod before it blows. The second scenario allows you to play as an Alien. Here, your job is to find and protect the Queen from the Marines and the Predators. Finally, you can play as the Predator. The Predator must simply find and kill the Alien Queen. The game plays like a first person shooter. The play field consists of the 5 levels of the training base, plus areas for the Predator and Alien ships. All the areas of the ship are inter-connected, giving the game a huge virtual environment. Depending on the scenario you choose, you will have to choose different strategies based on the capabilities of your character. For example, the Marine will have to make use of his weapons and his ability to use the ship&apos;s computer terminals. The Aliens, on the other hand, will have to make use of their great numbers and ability to cocoon their enemies. And finally the Predator must fight with honor, and not over-use his invisibility capability.</story>

There are four difficulty levels, each with 3 cups to race for. After completing all the cups for a difficulty level, you get to challenge a boss kart in a single race match. If you beat the boss, he becomes a playable character. The various cup races can be played in either single player or two player split screen modes.</story>

    <story>Similar to Speedball 2 in many ways, this is an ultra-violent sports game. Matches last 7 minutes, and the aim is to get the ball into a goal at each end, guarded by a net-minder. The ball can be thrown or kicked, and is an oval, resulting in frequent up-and-under type kicks. The gameplay is fast and flowing, and has one rule - if you can&apos;t get the ball, get the man, and decapitate him if possible. Bonus and non-bonus items appear on the pitch, such as bombs to throw at opponents, rabbits to speed up the current player, or tortoises to slow him down. Teams consist of humans and aliens, many of which have their own unique skills. There&apos;s a lot of blood and flailing limbs, giving things a gruesomely humorous edge. There are four leagues to progress through, plus a knockout cup and single matches.</story>

What&apos;s worse, the resistance forces have had their secret weapons stolen from them and put into pods spread out on many different planets. You must pilot the T-Griffon morphing attack craft to each planet and recover the pods to stop the Pernitians. So, in each planet, or level, you must collect a certain number of pods and make it to the exit before the enemies shoot you down. Fortunately, there are power-ups that can strategically enhance the T-Griffon&apos;s offensive capabilities. After clearing 8 planets, you take on a boss creature/ship before moving on to the next sector. There are 4 levels like this to clear, each with progressively increasing difficulty.</story>

    <story>Defender 2000 is an update of the classic arcade game by Eugene Jarvis. This Jaguar game features a port of the original game, and two updated versions- Defender Plus and Defender 2000. Defender combines a side scrolling shooter with a search and rescue game. You control a ship that travels left and right above the planets surface. Alien lander craft warp into the play area, and begin to descend to the surface. Along the surface, there are humanoids ripe for the picking. The alien landers grab the humanoids and begin to carry them up the screen. You have to shoot the landers before they reach the top of the screen, and catch the humanoids before they fall to the surface. The Defender Plus update features gameplay that is very similar to the original, and graphics that have a crazy, psychedelic look. The Defender 2000 update adds playfields that scroll in both directions, weapon power-ups, bonus rounds, improved graphics, and extremely high speed gameplay.</story>

    <story>The Union Aerospace Corporation has been experimenting with teleportation technology on Mars&apos; moons Phobos and Deimos. After early successes, something goes wrong. It seems the scientists have opened a gateway straight to Hell. Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and the whole of Deimos simply vanishes. A squad of marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are quickly slaughtered. It falls to the surviving marine to grab some guns and strike back at the demons. id Software&apos;s follow-up to their genre-defining Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM is another first person shooter- full-on action seen from the space marine&apos;s perspective. Like Wolfenstein, the game consists of distinct episodes, playable in any order. The first episode, Knee-Deep in the Dead, takes place in the Phobos base and is freely available as shareware. The full game continues on Deimos in The Shores of Hell and culminates in Inferno, the final episode which takes place in Hell itself. Each episode consists of nine levels, one of which is a hidden level. The basic objective in each level is simply to reach the exit. Since dozens of enemies stand in the way, the only way to get there is through killing them. Switches and buttons must be pressed to advance at certain points and often color-coded locked doors will block the way - matching keycards or skull keys must be found to pass. DOOM&apos;s engine technology is more advanced than Wolfenstein&apos;s, and thus the levels are more varied and complex. The engine simulates different heights (stairs and lifts appear frequently) and different lighting conditions (some rooms are pitch black, others only barely illuminated). There are outdoor areas, pools of radioactive waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come down and crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein&apos;s orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in DOOM can be in any angle to each other. An automap helps in navigating the levels. Stylistically, the levels begin with a futuristic theme in the military base on Phobos and gradually change to a hellish environment, complete with satanic symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses and portraits of horned demons), hung-up mutilated corpses and the distorted faces of the damned. DOOM features a large weapon arsenal, with most weapons having both advantages and drawbacks. The starting weapons are the fists and a simple pistol. Also available are a shotgun (high damage, slow reload, not good at distances), a chaingun (high firing rate, but slightly inaccurate in longer bursts) and a plasma rifle (combining a high firing rate and large damage). The rocket launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the explosion causes blast damage and must be used with care in confined areas or it might prove deadly to the player as well as the enemies. Two further (in)famous weapons in DOOM are the chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the BFG9000 energy gun, that, while taking some practice to fire correctly, can destroy most enemies in a single burst. The different weapons use four different ammunition types (bullets, shells, rockets and energy cells), so collecting the right type for a certain gun is important. DOOM drops some of Wolfenstein&apos;s arcade-inspired aspects, so there are no extra lives or treasures to be collected for points, but many other powerups are still available. Medpacks heal damage while armor protects from receiving it in the first place. Backpacks allow more ammunition to be carried, a computer map reveals the whole layout of the level on the automap (including any secret areas), light amplification visors illuminate dark areas and radiation suits allow travel over waste without taking damage. Also available are berserk packs (which radically increase the damage inflicted by the fists) as well as short-time invisibility and invulnerability powerups. The enemies to be destroyed include former humans corrupted during the invasion, plus demons in all shapes and sizes- fireball-throwing imps, floating skulls, pink-skinned demons with powerful bite attacks and large one-eyed flying monstrosities called Cacodemons. Each episode ends with a boss battle against one or two especially powerful creatures. DOOM popularized multiplayer in the genre with two different modes- Cooperative allows up to four players to move through the single-player game together, while Deathmatch is a competitive game type where players blast at each other to collect &apos;frag&apos; points for a kill and re-spawn in a random location after being killed.</story>

    <story>In this isometric football game, 50 national teams are represented to play in two game modes- Exhibition and Tournament (a series of seven games on four continents, with a final against the World All-Stars), with the ability to set time, difficulty level, see cutscenes after goals and if players are free to kick each other around without (many) fouls. While the game seems short-featured for 1995 standards, the tournament mode includes a twist- depending on how well the player defeats his opponents, he can trade his standard players, who won&apos;t do anything spectacular (but at least fill up the ranks) for star players, who not only look different, are able to cross and backheel the ball but also have a unique ability at the disposal of the player- 1. The Marker- can latch on an opposing player, stopping him from running away with the ball; 2. Goalkeeper 1- more capable of stopping shots than the regular goalkeeper; 3. Barger- this large, muscular player is able to shove everyone in his path; 4. Tricky- capable of jumping (or bunny-hopping, to be more precise) with the ball tucked between his feet, avoiding tackles; 5. The Cheat- while it&apos;s hard to talk about fair play in a game where kicking a defenders&apos; leg to gain a corner is (mostly) a legitimate play, this player takes the whole thing into the next level, being able to dig fouls out of nowhere, at the expense of the ball (if he&apos;s carrying it or the referee waves play on) or just some stains in his shirt (if he&apos;s trying to pull an offensive foul), with the odds of 50/50 (25% for penalties); 6. Passer- capable of feeding forwards with laser-precision passes; 7. Striker 1- capable of unleashing impossibly-sliced shots, scoring from virtually any position in the offensive area; 8. Striker 2- best used from positions directly in front of goal, this striker features a shot that is so powerful the ball ignites as it approaches the goal; 9. Goalkeeper 2- features a better chance of stopping special shots from both Strikers; In Exhibition games teams start with their own setup of start players, from none to a full team. The playing surface also affects gameplay - playing in wet grass removes all ball bounce, the opposite occurring with sand, and the most dramatic change, a rocky field where the ball can change direction after hitting the ground, turning throw-ins into corners, poor attempts on goals and vice-versa.</story>

There is plenty of fighting to do - shooting soldiers, security drones and robots. You&apos;ll also be avoiding traps, finding switches to open doors and shooting down breakable walls to find hidden areas with goodies and bonus points. In between levels, spend the money you&apos;ve found to upgrade your weapon by visiting a shopkeeper. Exploration is a major part of the game, so the levels can be larger than they first appear.</story>

    <story>The giant supercomputer that controls the world&apos;s information has been infected with viruses. You must enter the virtual world known as the I-Way, and clear them out with your anti-virus tank. I-War is a 3D virtual reality tank game. In each of the 21 levels, you must find all the data pods and make your way to the exit. Enemy tanks, turrets, and bombers stand in your way, as well as occasional traps or locked doors controlled by hidden switches. Levels are divided into simple, enclosed rooms, linearly connected by one-way teleporters. You can select a fast, medium, or heavy tank at the beginning of the game, with its abilities reflected in the strength of its guns or the amount of punishment it can absorb. Throughout the game, you will also find weapon power-ups and tank upgrades (such as shields, radar, and auto-targeting) to help you stay effective against the increasing numbers of enemy defenders. You can save your progress to the cart at the end of each level. Between levels are bonus rounds where you pilot your tank through a corridor and try to collect a set percentage of data pods. Meeting that percentage earns you an extra life.</story>

    <story>Missile Command 3D is an update to the classic Atari arcade game. The goal in Missile Command is to defend your cities against an onslaught of missiles coming from the sky. Your arsenal consists of three anti-missile flak cannons. You have to position the anti-missile clouds in the path of the incoming missiles to stop them from impacting. This Jaguar game has 3 modes. First, there is a port of the original arcade game. There are neat extras for this mode like graphic backdrops and the ability to resize or scale the screen. The second mode is Missile Command 3D. This mode retains the gameplay of the original, but adds 3D graphics to the mix. The final mode, Virtual Missile Command, changes things up quite a lot. Instead of anti-missile flak, your cannons shoot lasers. This means you don&apos;t need to lead your targets anymore. You play the game from a first-person perspective, and must switch between the three cannons via buttons on the keypad. There are nine levels in this mode, each with a boss at the end.</story>

    <story>This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the NBA teams. Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers. Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate. The Tournament Edition ups each team&apos;s roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player&apos;s stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu- 1. &amp;quot;Hot Spots&amp;quot; are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them. Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant &amp;quot;on-fire,&amp;quot; enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground. &amp;quot;Juice Mode&amp;quot; increases the speed of the game up to 4x. &amp;quot;Tournament Mode&amp;quot; disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.</story>

The most significant change is the addition of red and yellow cards for discipline (2 yellow card offenses or one ‘professional foul’ (denying your opponent a clear goal-scoring opportunity) results in that player being sent off).

The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park&apos;s allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides. Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay. You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don&apos;t let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides. It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</story>

    <story>Towers II, Plight of the Stargazer, a single-player, single-character, first-person RPG, is the sequel to Towers which was released for the Falcon system. This game begins where the first one left off - you and your party are shipwrecked on the island of Lamini. The crew has spent several months making repairs to their ship, but before they are able to leave the Sheriff of Lamini pleads for help. It seems that one of the island&apos;s highest ranking council members, the wizard Lord Daggan, has completely lost his senses. All sorts of strange and unusual things have been happening. He has been ranting and raving, blowing things up, and digging up the corpses of dead mystics. Daggan has remained locked up inside his castle and no one sent to confront him has been heard from since. So naturally you accept the quest. Begin by selecting a character from the four available- Merton, the wizard; Tasler, the boy; Andros, the circus performer; or Gerand, the fighter. Then roll until you get the statistics you like for Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity and Constitution. Each of the characters has his own specialty. The entire game takes place within Daggan&apos;s tower. There are 11 floors, which you can move between freely via stairs, teleporters, and the occasional levitation through a hole in the floor. There are no shops for buying and selling, so you must use what you find in the castle. As you progress through the levels, various mini-quests present themselves (charging an artifact, forging a sword, for instance). Most puzzles have been designed so they can be solved two different ways. Music plays throughout the game and the sounds of doors opening and closing, your footsteps, monster footsteps, etc. can be heard.</story>

Competition mode provides a series of timed events in which to compete leading up to a final timed event. The other two modes are self-explanatory. Game play is presented with scaled 2D sprites that present a 3D effect, similar to many early racing games.

    <story>This is the game of basketball the way many people learn to play it - in the city streets - with loose rules and in various suburban locales. Inspired by the 1992 film about high stakes street basketball gambling, in this game you can wager how much you want on each game. The action is seen from the half court line, with a screen view that pans and zooms to follow the action. Aside from a goal tending penalty and the need to clear the ball, anything goes. For instance, steals are effected by shoving an opponent and making a grab for the ball. Your goal is to get enough money to enter, and win, the tournament. If you make $5000, you instantly get entered into the tournament. You have the ability to save your game in this mode so that you can come back later if you run short on time and don&apos;t want to lose all your money. Opt for a single game or the Slam City tournament, while game options determine time limits, scoring system, and control schemes. There are fifteen teams to choose from, and up to four players can get in on the action (with the Jaguar Team Tap adapter included with the game).</story>

    <story>id software&apos;s adaptation of their classic first-person shooter Wolfenstein 3D to consoles is not a straight port, but a remix with substantial changes as well as new additions. While the basic gameplay of exploring levels, shooting enemies, collecting treasures, keys and power-ups remain the same, only half of the original game&apos;s 60 levels have been retained. Each of those 30 levels (grouped into six missions, with two levels being secret ones) is a simplified version of an original level. The end bosses for the missions are taken from both Wolf3D as well as its sequel, Spear of Destiny. Other changes from the original include new power-ups- an ammo box (taken from Spear of Destiny) and backpack that increases the maximum amount of ammo that can be carried. The original&apos;s weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun, chaingun) all return, but there are also two completely new tools of destruction- a flame thrower and a rocket launcher.</story>

    <story>Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around. Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack- the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends. There&apos;s a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders. There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.</story>

    <story>Zero 5 was one of the last Telegames releases for the Jaguar, right before Worms. It is a wild space-shooter, placing you in control of a small and manuverable fighter craft, or a powerful warship, depending upon which level you play. Taking on the role of a pilot, you must defend the earth from alien attack with dozens of missions needed to succeed. Your tour of duty includes travelling through deep space to meet enemy convoys head on and shooting across asteroid and planet surfaces taking out installations. There are 3 different play modes- 1. HIT-PAK Mode - Somewhat like a variation on the Missle Command 3D VR mode. You are in a turret with four guns to blast everything in sight, including asteroids in several levels. No powerups make it more difficult. 2. BAMBAM Mode - Consists of piloting around in the fighter, shooting every object that moves, in 360 degrees. Includes power-ups for weapons, shields, and score. 3. TRENCH Mode - Star Wars style shooting in your BAMBAM fighter, you run along a trench. Also includes power-ups.</story>

    <story>The sequel to Zool sees him take on the bad guys Mental Block and Krool across 15 levels. Zool 2 is a platform game where you control the titular Ninja of the Nth Dimension (or his girlfriend, Zooz, who can complete each level in a slightly different way) as he rampages through a variety of levels, collecting countless tasty treats, shooting any enemies that he encounters and finding bonuses (there&apos;s a variety of special power-ups Zool can find - for example, a bomb that follows him and can be blown up at any time to remove on-screen enemies, or a temporary invulnerability). New to the sequel is Zool&apos;s ability to scale walls and his new spinning attacks. On each level you have to collect a certain amount of the featured fruit within an allocated time limit, and then find the exit across the multi-directionally-scrolling levels. There are lots of hidden areas to see, including a bonus Breakout game starring Zool&apos;s pet 2-headed dog.</story>

In order to eliminate the other shapes, you must point your piece at it and &apos;fire&apos;. If the shape is the same color as your piece, the shape is eliminated, as well as all of the shapes of the same color behind it, until your piece hits a piece of a different color. If the shape is of a different color, or it is hit when collecting a line of similar shapes, your piece exchanges colors with the shape.</story>
