    <story>A 3D Tetris game with a supply of three modes- A. A three dimensional well appears, large enough to hold five layers of Tetris blocks. Every time you complete a layer with you falling blocks it will vanish and you will be rewarded by a hefty dose of points. If you ever stack over the five layers you will lose one of your layers, once all five are lost your game is over. B. In this mode you place blocks around the center of the well, any blocks placed in the center will vanish, unless the block completes a layer in which case it will vanish. C. In this mode a shape will be shown before the game begins. You will have to replicate this shape perfectly, even one block out of place and your game is over.

    <story>Once a year, on Halloween, the portal between the World of Fairies and the human world is open, allowing the fairies to come and visit the children for one day. However, they must return home before the end of the day; otherwise they&apos;ll never be able to return to the World of Fairies again. It&apos;s up to you to get Jack back home before Halloween is over. You start the game by choosing one of the three Jack Bros- Jack Frost, Lantern or Ripper. You then must make your way through six levels consisting of sixty floors of play. The core gameplay is very much like Namco&apos;s coin-op classic, The Tower of Druaga. Within the time limit, you must locate all the keys on a floor, which opens up the exit and allows you to venture to a lower floor. In your way are both obstacles and enemies, which you must avoid or take out if you are to reach the exit. On the lowest floor of each level is a boss enemy whom you must defeat if you are to get Jack home in time. </story>

As before, the goal is to clear a screen of enemies and move on to the next level. However, rather than doing this by flipping an enemy upside-down from underneath and kicking them away, you throw shells at them. Also, taking advantage of Virtual Boy&apos;s added depth, there is a front area and a back area which can be traveled to and from using pipes. Shells can also be thrown at enemies on the other depth area.</story>

Robots that are remotely controlled by human controllers now duke it out in the ring. Similar to the boxing game Punch Out!!, the player ducks to the left and right avoiding blows from the robotic competitor, getting jabs in when they’re off guard. Each of the 8 or so opponents has a different weakness for the player to exploit. A special variety of “Machine Gun” charge attacks can be utilized to help the player make it up to the top of the Teleroboxer circuit. </story>

Mode A is the familiar endless mode of play, where you&apos;ll keep going until you&apos;ve let the pile reach too high.

If an Atoller is captured, you can still rescue it by destroying the Smoker before it leaves the playing area. Once all the enemies are gone, you&apos;ll be given a bonus based on how many Atollers you have remaining, and then move on to the next level.
