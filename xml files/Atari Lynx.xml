    <story>You are police officer Bob, whose aim is to apprehend a certain quota of criminals (litterbugs, speeders and the like) each day. This is done by chasing them and sounding your siren at them - in some cases they will need ramming off the road. There are also hardened criminals to catch - if you can get one of these to confess, your day&apos;s work is considered done. The game&apos;s action is presented with an overhead view of your squad car. Car upgrades are available, to be brought from your reward money. You earn Demerits by crashing, wrongly arresting innocents, or failing to meet your quota. Too many demerits and it is game over.</story>

    <story>In a desperate attempt to stop inner-city gang wars, the city leaders organized a basketball league. The league is scheduled to play on three courts- a street, a junkyard, and a rooftop. The mayor figured that a friendly game of hoops would be a much more peaceful way to settle disputes. He was wrong. You can choose 1-on-1 or 2-on-2 game modes. There are six characters to choose from (ten in Atari Lynx version); each with their own health, speed, and power attributes. Each player without the ball can jump to block a shot or punch there opponent to get the ball. There&apos;s also an option to perform a power throw on an opposing player. Players with the ball can shoot or pass. Power ups appear on the court at random instances. These power up one attribute for the player. For example, the lightning power up increases the player&apos;s speed. The referee does not call fouls, but does hurl knives at the players.</story>

Batman must move through four levels on his quest to stop the Penguin and Catwoman. Enemies trying to stop him include circus clowns on the streets, policemen (whom Catwoman put on his trail) on the roofs of Gotham City, and penguin commandos in the sewers and the Penguin&apos;s lair. Batman can beat them up with his fists or destroy them using Batarangs and acid vials (which must be collected first). Several of the levels end in boss encounters with the two main villains, while in the last level, Batman must also save industrialist Max Shreck from the Penguin&apos;s wrath before finishing him off.</story>

The game is an update on the classic arcade game Battlezone and stays true to the original in terms of gameplay. The gameplay involves you driving round a landscape destroying enemy tanks and U.F.O.s whilst trying not to run out of fuel and also not getting destroyed yourself though luckily there are fuel pick-ups and power-ups to collect. You can also use the credits earned for completing missions to upgrade your tank. There are also a few different tanks to choose from including the Rhino which is heavily armoured but runs out of fuel faster than the other tanks.</story>

    <story>The Lynx title based on the Keanu Reeves/Alex Winter film franchise actually takes place after the second film, Bill and Ted&apos;s Bogus Journey. Out for revenge after being humiliated by the high-school duo, Death kidnaps their medieval babe girlfriends from the first film, and drags them throughout history. Luckily, the girls are able to leave behind pages of the band&apos;s latest song as a trail for Bill and Ted to follow. Playing as either Bill or Ted (with a friend able to take control of the other character over ComLynx), the player must search historical periods in an overhead perspective and collect enough musical notes to open travel to a new area. Along the way, they can encounter historical figures who will offer assistance in return for a favor. Bad guys do populate the levels, but can be pacified with a rippin&apos; guitar solo. If Bill or Ted are defeated, they simply reappear back at the last checkpoint. Other items can be found and collected in an inventory. The Lynx title makes use of the series&apos; interesting take on the time continuum, allowing the player to leave items for themselves in the past to collect and use in the future. Likewise, if the player happens upon a sudden fortuitous item that they left, they must remember to go and leave the item in the past themselves to avoid creating a time paradox. This quirky view of time forms the basis of many of the game&apos;s puzzles. A password system is constantly updated (viewable at the pause screen) to save the player&apos;s progress.</story>

While testing a piece of equipment, you are transported into a bubble world. Fortunately, a friendly denizen decides to help you. You must locate the correct type of radioactive particles to move from world to world and finally home, before the hostile denizens of these worlds burst your bubble. You move your bubble by pushing in the desired direction. Be advised that you do not stop easily and can bounce out of control if you are not careful. Pushing the A button fires a bubble shot that will ricochet around. You can use this action to bounce shots at enemies that are around a corner. Pressing B drops a bubble bomb straight down. Pressing Option 1 switches options on the screen, including the suicidal Burst!!!, that are then activated by pressing Option 2. The one you will use most is Use scanner. This will bring up the scanner that looks like a radar screen and will show you the approximate location of your needed particles. Once you locate and gather all the particles needed in the level, you move on to the next level. After you finish five levels, you win the game.</story>

In Crystal Mines II, you operate a robot going through the abandoned crystal mines, picking up crystals and avoiding the underground demons that inhabit the mine. Mine levels are completed when a crystal quota is reached, however the quota is usually not the entire level so bonus points can be obtained by finding additional crystals. Like Boulder Dash, gravity is a factor and affects any boulders, crystals, etc. so they can be used as weapons against demons. There are also deceptive elements, such as &amp;quot;Dormant&amp;quot; demons that look like boulders, that add to the challenge. Finally, the robot has weapons that can be used to eliminate certain obstacles.</story>

He loves to rock, but his guitar can strum more than notes. Musically weaponized, he&apos;s off to get his bandmates with the help of his guitar-gun (maybe it&apos;s a mortar - hard to say). Fat Bobby is a single player platformer that primarily side scrolls, but also has some vertical territory to explore. There&apos;s nothing particularly stellar about the graphics or game play... which is a shame because I like the story - brief as it is.A rocker sets out to rescue his band with his weaponized guitar! That&apos;s awesome and deserves a much better game to accompany that story. The graphics aren&apos;t bad, they just don&apos;t pop the way they should when a rockstar is shooting enemies with a guitar-gun. The real issue is jumping. That B button combined with directional movement can result in some unpredictable results. By unpredictable I mean you die.As Fat Bobby jumps, his impressive vertical rise causes a slight jerk to the screen as it scrolls to keep him in view. Thankfully, each leap can be made As you seek out your bandmates, you&apos;ll encounter Dr. Mephisto&apos;s henchmen and a variety of items to pick up from musical notes to egg timers and shields. Each level is timed, but you should have no problem cruising through it without watching the clock. Fat Bobby rocks out at the conclusion of each level.</story>

    <story>The evil spider Zendocon has trapped you in its web of universes. Your mission is to defeat Zendocon&apos;s droids and brave the 51 universes to fight Zendocon itself to the death! Gates of Zendocon is a side-scrolling shooter very similar to the original arcade shooter of this type, Scramble. Unlike Scramble, there are 51 game areas in total, but the player fights through a subset of them through branches, choosing the next area to visit. Some aliens will join you when shot (power-ups). Alien bases in each area allow you to repair your weapons and shield, but landing at the wrong time will cause your ship to explode and lose all power-ups.</story>

    <story>Hard Drivin&apos; is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... The course has two sections- speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is reset and you get up to speed again. The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.</story>

Additionally, when desired, the player can get an oracle reading by asking a question...the question is answered when the player makes a very elegant play (4 way match).

If not, you will need to be ready to return your opponent&apos;s return. Run back and forth as you try to keep hitting the ball over the net until your opponent misses, or you do. When you hit the ball, you will want to attempt changing the direction and speed of the ball to throw your opponent off balance. This is the real challenge of any tennis game.</story>

    <story>In Joust, players take control of a knight with a lance who rides their flying ostrich (or stork, for Player 2) to do battle against computer-controlled evil knights who ride atop vultures. Players must flap their steed&apos;s wings to hit the enemy from a higher jousting point to destroy the vulture and its rider. Once the enemy has been hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in the game. Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded unbeatable(?) pterodactyl. The game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.</story>

    <story>In 1982, a sequel to the incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man. This sequel continued on the eat the dots/avoid the ghosts gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh. Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics. One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man. Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost&apos;s eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again. Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of Junior.</story>

When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu&apos;s father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world. Ninja Gaiden is a side scrolling game where Ryu the ninja can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats. Ryu will battle through urban city settings, forests, jungles, snow covered castles, underground railroads, and ancient castles. A major feature in Ninja Gaiden are the cinematic scenes -- sometimes fullscreen -- through which the storyline unfolds.</story>

    <story>This is the third entry in the series of fast-paced ninja action games, and is the last game in the series to be released on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Some time has passed since the defeat of Ashtar and the resurrected Jaquio, and Irene Lew has received a new mission to complete. She is to observe a strange factory that has been constructed recently for an unknown purpose, and investigate it. She proceeds to reconnoiter it, but is intercepted and apparently assassinated by her friend Ryu Hayabusa...except it isn&apos;t Ryu. It is an imposter. The real Ryu, angered over her death, and the subsequent false accusation that he murdered her, continues her mission and proceeds to investigate the factory. As stated, this was the last game in the regular series produced for the NES. It had many features the previous games in the series did not, such as a power up to extend the length of your sword, a new vertical wave attack and vertically-scrolling levels. The US version of the game is reputed to be the hardest in the series, due to the extra damage incurred when hit, slightly shorter regular sword length, limited continues and more enemies. The Lynx port is the second Ninja Gaiden game on the platform, the first being a port from the Arcade Version. This port is identical to the NES game, but the in-game picture is compressed for the smaller screen of the Lynx.</story>

Of course, aliens being played out, the Ceegarians are actually referred to as transdimensional intruders, and the Ceegarian creatures the player faces off against are referred to as evil invading Sinlendo Techmods. The primary goal of the game is to work through stages and bosses essentially to build a bomb to destroy the Ceegarians. Pertaining to the bomb, there are six components. The entire game takes place within, as the box refers to it, our dimension&apos;s reactor. As such, the environments of the game are aimed to look like the inside of a machine. To further convolute the storyline, the instruction manual actually refers to the game itself as a Virtual Reality simulation the player is experiencing in the future, based on the exploits of Redd Ace, and you’re meandering through this simulator on the “famous Atarian Leisure Moon.” Stages are fairly small, but designed like a maze à la Metroid. However, unlike Metroid, completed areas cannot be revisited. Each stage ends with a boss battle showcasing enemy characters that are often two screens high. Redd Ace is armed with a multi-use weapon known as the Tmat MOW. Tmat MOW is intended to be short for “TRANSMAT Multi-Ordinance Weapon.” Four different weapons may be acquired and used for both the A and B buttons, with eight total weapons in the game, and one gun as a standard. Other weapons include lasers, a flame thrower, missiles, bombs, and the like. Weapons must be picked up through playing the stages and collecting various weapon icons. Once the ammunition is used, the weapon is gone and must be recollected. As such, weapon pick-ups must be used sparingly, especially since most contain very small numbers of ammunition, often as low as two shots. Choosing weapons is awkwardly assigned to the Directional-pad, which is also where character movement is assigned. Tapping the D-pad allows the player to select different weapons, while holding it down moves Redd. Controlling Redd Ace is somewhat different from a typical platformer of the era. There is no jump button, as both the A and B buttons have weapons assigned to them. Instead, our hero is also armed with a levitation pack on his back, which allows flight. Tapping up on the D-Pad allows Redd to jump, while holding up activates the levitator and allows Redd to fly. Aside from a health bar, there is also a fuel bar showing that flight isn&apos;t a luxury to be wasted. When crouching, Redd automatically aims upwards at a 45-degree angle, rather than straight ahead. Pressing the Option 2 button allows the player to see a menu with information about the bomb pieces the player is collecting, as well as details on the various weapons. If the player is standing in front of a computer monitor when Option 2 is pressed, the menu shows a map of the current area, and information on enemy characters. The player starts with three lives, and there are no continues. There are, however, three difficulty modes--Easy, Normal, and Hard—which may be selected prior to gameplay.</story>

    <story>In this game, you guide a marker which must draw rectangles and other weird objects in order to claim your territory, and you can either draw these rectangles fast or slow. Drawing the rectangles using the slow method awards you the most points. Once a rectangle has been made, it will be colored in to show that you have claimed your territory. While drawing the rectangles, you need to watch out for Qix (pronounced kicks), a series of colored lines that crawl the screen. In addition to Qix, you also need to avoid the Sparks who travel around the border, as well as any lines that you have made, as well as The Fuse, who travels along the line that you are drawing.

Raiden (called Raiden Trad on the Genesis and SNES) is an over-head vertical-scrolling shooter, based on an arcade game of the same title. It features two forms of weapon upgrades and two types of missiles (normal or homing). You start the game with several bombs which you can use to destroy most enemies on the screen to get yourself out of a jam. Each level ends with a large boss or bosses.</story>

Numerous enemies are out on the road to try and stop you, including armored cars, motorcycles, canons on the side of the road, landmines, and more. Your vehicle is equipped with a machine gun to help you out, and occasionally a weapons plane will fly in and drop additional power ups that can be collected. Some of these are the U.Z. canon, cruise missiles, and speed boost. Your car has a very limited amount of fuel, however more can be picked up along the way by crossing the halfway point of a level, or by collecting the red and green fuel spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies. On many levels collecting fuel is critical otherwise you won&apos;t be able to reach the finish line.</story>

After nearly four centuries of the World Party being in control, the International Party is inclined to take over. Rumors regarding the President&apos;s death not being accidental are unconfirmed, but the World Party is still going on the defensive. Conventional warfare has been relegated to the obsolete and uncivilized past so the two parties are to settle the dispute the new, modern way, Robo-Squash.Robo-Squash is a game in which the player must catch as many balls in rows or columns as possible to win. An alternative way to win is to be the first player to hit the mechanical spider. As a round continues longer and longer, the balls will increase in speed, making the round progressively harder. Points can be collected by hitting bricks, special items, and the spider. When one of the players loses three balls or hits the mechanical spider, the round is over.If the player wins, the World Party will remain in power. If the player loses the International Party will win and divide the world into separate countries surely resulting in the same petty fighting that almost destroyed civilization in the 21st Century.</story>

    <story>Based on the 1989 Atari Games (not to be confused with Atari Corporation, producers of the Lynx) coin-op by Ed Rotberg. It&apos;s 2492 and you must pilot your Sub-Terranean Underground Network (S.T.U.N.) craft at speeds over 900 miles per hour through a series of courses to retain your title as S.T.U.N. Runner, completing each course before time runs out. There are also enemies on each course, such as cycles, indestructible armored drones, and flying bird-like craft. Shoot or avoid them. If you hit them, you lose one of your shields (your craft has six total) and are slowed down temporarily. The more shields you have at the finish line, the more bonus points you get. Getting hit with no shields does not kill you, however. There are no lives in this game. The only way to lose is to fail to cross the finish line. Along the way you&apos;ll encounter Boost Pads that temporarily speed you up to incredible speeds and make you indestructible. By running over enough green stars on each course, you can also earn Shockwaves, which destroy all enemies in your path. Note that there is no accelerator in this game. Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit something. Then you will slow down, but quickly accelerate back to full speed. Other than that, you cannot slow down and the only way to speed up is to run over a Boost Pad. Your only controls are steering left and right and aiming the gun on top of your craft up and down.</story>

    <story>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man&apos;s body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father. As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard. Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the very challenging and the impossible. The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited- duck, jump and only two attacks- punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</story>

A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.

Gameplay is simple- D-Pad is used to move up/down left/right and any button is used to shoot. The speed is not controllable. The aerial phase looks like the classic Afterburner but in a first person view. The player can dive whenever he wants. Sometimes headquarters will order the player to dive and it means the player is near a gem pod were he can collect diamonds. Near gem pods there is always a supply depot where bonuses (powerful shots, tracking missiles...) can be bought with the collected diamonds. Underwater the player moves a bit slower, and there are obstacles to avoid (like sunken antic temple columns).In the two player mode, the winner of a level is the one who has the higher score in this level.</story>

    <story>A combat flight action/simulation with colorful graphics and pretty straight-forward gameplay. Step inside the cockpit of a World War I plane, when there were no sophisticated weaponry, and try to gun down the enemy. Simple as that. The graphics were faux-3D, as the planes were 2D sprites (natural, considering the release date), but the sky seemed very vast and you could fly around freely.</story>

    <story>Xenos. The very name strikes fear into every colonist&apos;s heart. A distress call is received from space stations orbiting your homeworld, then silence. A single ship escapes, piloted by a battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch into acid-spitting Xenos. A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld. Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it. You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs. Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987. Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.</story>

    <story>Xybots is either an unusually simple computer game or an unusually complex coin-op shoot &apos;em up, depending on your point of view. With either one or two players, you must move through a series of Gauntlet-style underground mazes, killing the bad guys and collecting health and other bonuses from flying saucers (underground? SLIGHT logic gap there, methinks).It&apos;s designed to be played co-operatively, although bullets from one player can harm the other. The Xybots are out to stop you, of course, and many have advanced attack patterns as well as bullets to fire at you. Being able to view round corners is useful, allowing you to plan a strategy - often it&apos;s good to send one player forward and let the other play the waiting game, as in Gauntlet.</story>

    <story>Zarlor Mercenary is a vertically scrolling shooter in which players takes the role of a mercenary group. The scenario is a long-time war between the Mendicant and Zarlor races and the mercenaries are hired by the Zarlors to clear out six levels hold by Mendicants. The basic gameplay consists of using a space ship to kill all enemy opposition on the way to the level end. Getting hit by their attacks lowers the health bar which leads to a life loss when completely gone. On the other hand, every killed enemy or destroyed building gives money which can be used between levels to buy upgrades like mega bombs (damages all enemies on the screen), a back cannon, extra lives or a powerful shield. While the direction is always vertically, the screen can be slightly scrolled left and right. Up to four players can participate in co-op gameplay; the difficulty is only effected by starting out with less lives. Then there are also two additional upgrades to buy- invisibility to hide from other players and back stabber which damages the other players instead of the enemies.</story>
