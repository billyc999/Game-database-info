    <story>In late 1998, a few months after the release of Battle on the Edge, Sega released an updated version, known as Daytona USA 2- Power Edition. Changes in this game include the environment of the beginner course; the dome and natural scenery that encircles the track in the regular release is removed, but the course layout remains the same. Also included is the Challenge course option, which combines all three courses together. Along with slightly revamped handling physics, the beginner car&apos;s design is slightly altered. Added to Power Edition is the Hornet Classic car, the player car from Daytona USA with an altered design. The opponent cars&apos; AI is also more aggressive in this version, with another change being to one corner in the advanced course to balance out the difficulty. Before this change, many experts considered this corner the most difficult in the game.</story>

    <story>Madō King Granzort is based on the anime of the same name. The story takes place in science-fiction scenario in which a few kids get special powers to save the world from the evil Jadou Clan. To be more exact, they can summon three powerful creatures- The Madou kings of earth, water and wind. The player takes the role of those kings to defeat the Jadou Clan. The player needs to find the way through the levels while solving basic platforming challenges and a lot of fighting, either with a sword or by shooting. The player can switch between the Madou kings which have different abilities. It is important to look after the energy bar and the time limit- both result in the loss of a life when running out.Daytona USA 2 is an arcade racing game released by Sega in 1998 as a follow-up to the extremely successful Daytona USA. The game featured vastly superior graphics, utilizing the Sega Model 3 hardware. The majority of Daytona USA 2 cabinets were released as deluxe models (with far fewer Twin Cabinets), which could be linked together for up to four players. A notable change from the original is the ability to select a car and corresponding driver, each with varying capabilities for varying levels of player experience. Just like before, the game has three courses – a Beginner course with 8 laps with a distance of 1 mile (1.6 km), an Advanced course with 4 laps with a distance of 2.5 miles (4 km), and a long Expert course with 2 laps with a distance of 5 miles (8 km). The &apos;time lap&apos; mode also returns, and is accessed in the same manner – by holding down start at the transmission select screen. Like the original game, mirrored versions of the tracks can also be played by holding down the Start button when selecting the course. It is recommended, however, that the player has had mastery of the course beforehand. By request, an arcade operator could put the game on Grand Prix or Endurance mode to increase the number of laps in a game. Finishing a race in the top 3 in any course allows the player to view an ending and see the game credits. An addition to the game was the slingshot, corresponding to advanced NASCAR drafting techniques</story>

    <story>In Harley-Davidson &amp; L.A. Riders, the player rides one of five Harley-Davidson models. The objective is to complete a series of checkpoints around Los Angeles under a time limit. The number of stages allotted depends on the machine&apos;s settings. It can be three, four, or five stages. The player also has to collect as many hidden items (such as tokens that resemble the Harley-Davidson logo) as possible, in order to earn bonus points. The token points range anywhere from 1,000 to 100,000 points. The tokens which are more lucrative (that range in larger point sizes from 10,000-100,000) are located in more obscure and irrelevant areas of Los Angeles. Tokens that are worth 3,000 points are located through street corners. Others that are worth 10,000-50,000 points are located in special areas such as the golf course in Beverly Hills, where a token worth 30,000 is located. Tokens worth 100,000 are more difficult to get and are located in obscure areas. Occasionally, the player will find red-yellow-colored tokens floating around more irrelevant areas that allow you to earn 5 or 10 seconds of bonus time</story>

    <story>The Lost World- Jurassic Park is a first-person LightGun rail shooter made as a tie-in to the 1997 movie of the same name and a follow up to the 1994 Jurassic Park arcade game by the same developer. It consists of five stages based on environments from the film, such as a laboratory or the workers&apos; village. Two male rangers travel through Jurassic Park in a jeep to find and save Ian Malcolm and Sarah Harding who have gone missing after landing on Isla Sorna. The game uses fixed, cinematic camera perspectives that move on when all dinosaurs in a scene have been killed. By moving to the edges of the screen it is possible to scroll slightly. The gun only has five bullets and reloading is done by pointing to the side along with a downward motion. A single credit provides three lives that deplete when a dinosaur manages to attack or someone innocent is shot. Many objects in the environment are destructible, including barrels that cause explosions. Bonus points are provided for snipe and quick shots. There are often boss fights against large dinosaurs with a health meter shown on the screen. Optionally power bars can be picked up that are converted into additional lives. The game offers some opportunities to save humans from attacking dinosaurs. If this is done before they are killed, a temporary weapons upgrade or additional health is provided. At the end of each stage a score is calculated based on the number of hits, technical shots, hit rate and a score for clearing the stage. At the start the player can choose from three difficulty levels- beginner, expert or shuffle. The game supports cooperative multiplayer with a second player shooting on the same screen using cross-hairs with a different colour. A second player can join at any time.</story>

    <story>The Seven Seas spread throughout the world. It is said that there is a monster for each of these seven seas. Ships are being attacked one after another. Sharks gather around monsters seeking human flesh. The ocean is not only a place of blessing but a place of terror. Defeat the violent gigantic monsters of the seven seas. An enormous bounty has been set for their heads. Brave youth go out to face the monsters. Set in an alternate steampunk world, a new civilization is flourishing in the seas. However, the sudden appearance of the Seven Great Monsters, accompanied by a number of lesser sea monsters and ordinary marine predators, have ravaged much of this newly-flourished civilization and, in addition, attacked the native marine life with increasing frequency. Frightened for their lives, humanity issues bounties on the monsters&apos; heads as well secondary bounties on the minor sea monsters. The game follows two young underwater adventurers, Torel (Player 1) and Chris (player 2), as they head out to defeat the Seven Great Monsters of the Seven Seas. Gameplay The Ocean Hunter is played by using two mounted turret-like Shock Guns on the arcade cabinet, which vibrate when shot to provide a feeling of realism. The game is capable of being played with either one or two people simultaneously. During the game, the players use the Shock Guns to aim at and shoot enemies while automatically traveling through the level on underwater scooters. The game is divided into seven stages. Each stage has its own enemies, sub boss(es) and a Great Monster boss to defeat at the end, all of which are usually based off of real-life marine animals. During the boss fights, there will be specific weak point(s) highlighted for the player to target. Firing upon these points three times defeats the boss and allows the player to advance to the next level. The player has a life meter consisting of 3 Life Points which decreases by either taking damage from enemies or by firing at friendly NPC divers, regardless of situation. Health can only be restored by obtaining health units from rescuing other divers. There are treasure chests throughout each stage that award bonus points if fired at. </story>

Exclusive to this course, players could press Start at the car select screen to race as a cat, a tank, an “AM2 crew” bus and a rocket car. There is also an attract mode, which is not in the game where a red sports car runs in an Italian village and destroys the Roman Coloseum. The background with the giant wheel is actually blue rather than yellow orange. There was no American release of Scud Race Plus. Apparently, Sega never marketed this version outside Japan, but it is possible to switch the country to USA and get Sega Super GT Plus which features everything from Scud Race Plus, but in the American format.

    <story>Sega Rally 2 is the sequel to Sega&apos;s hit arcade game, Sega Rally. This game, like it&apos;s predecessor, is based on Rally racing. Rally racing is unique in that races take place on both race tracks and off-road courses. The courses in this game reflect this nicely. Some take place in the desert or forest, others take place in cities. The cars in this game are all actual rally cars, with manufacturers from Europe and Japan both well represented. You do not get to see very many of them at one time, however, since rally races are typically time-based events. In this game, you are not competing directly against the other cars, you simply have to have the best time through the course. So, during any race you will usually see a handful of other cars on the track. Sega Rally 2 contains several modes of play. The first mode is the simple arcade mode of play. Here, you race in 4 courses, one right after another. The second mode is the 10 year championship. In this mode you race on 16 courses, and can make modifications to your car between races. Finally, there is a 2-person split screen mode for head-to-head competition.</story>

    <story>The game uses a control setup consisting of a single flight stick with two fire buttons and two Event buttons which flash when the player is able to trigger certain events in game such as summoning backup fighters. The player advances through 3 stages and can choose them in any order. Each stage is based on a single scene from the Star Wars trilogy. Players can score points by destroying enemies, completing levels, and performing combo hits on enemies in succession without missing a shot. Star Wars Episode IV- A New Hope- This stage depicts the Battle of Yavin, right up to the destruction of the Death Star. Star Wars Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back- The famous Battle of Hoth is depicted, and the player must assist in destroying AT-ATs as well as invading Echo Base. Star Wars Episode VI- Return of the Jedi- The player rides a speeder bike on Endor and shoots Imperial troopers, then moves towards the Empire&apos;s base and destroys an AT-ST. The game ends with the final space battle from Return of the Jedi with the destruction of the Death Star II. Two bonus stages are included where the player duels Boba Fett and Darth Vader using a lightsaber. The player must quickly execute joystick motions to block Fett&apos;s shots or Vader&apos;s lightsaber swings and take them down. Failing these stages will not cause the game to be lost but bonus points will not be gained. </story>

    <story>This iteration is the first in the series to have undulation in the stages, such as a staircase in the Great Wall stage, a stage set on top of a sloping roof and a raft constructed of individually moving elements on a bobbing water surface. A fourth button, the Dodge, was added (the series had previously used only three - Kick, Punch and Guard). Pressing the button with the joystick in neutral or held up makes the character move into the screen (i.e. away from the viewer), while pressing the button with the joystick held down makes the character move out of the screen (i.e. towards the viewer).

    <story>Virtua Fighter 3tb (Team Battle) is a port of the arcade game Virtua Fighter 3 to the Dreamcast. The tb adds a team battle mode which was not present in the coin-op. For those that do not know, the Virtua Fighter series is your classic beat-em-up, with a bunch of characters all trying to kick, punch, throw and body slam the bejesus out of each other. Each of the characters has over a hundred possible moves and the game plays very faithfully to the original. The game features interesting arena to fight in which are more like real locations in they are not flat and some parts can be broken away during the match.</story>
