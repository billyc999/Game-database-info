    <story>Bedlam is a multi-directional shooter. The player controls a cannon in the center of the screen that can rotate 360Â°. Around the player is a star-shaped geometric form that changes from stage to stage. The corners of the star emit enemy ships that must be destroyed. The ships have different attack patterns, from ones that just travel in a straight line towards to ones which are indestructible and can only be pushed away from the player. If one of the enemy ships makes contact with the player, they will lose a life.Besides the fire button, the player can use a quick turn to better defend against opponents coming in from the other side and a zap, which destroys all ships on screen. Later levels feature stars with corners slowly moving towards the player (and thus with enemies spawning much closer) and rotating star shapes.</story>

You control a vacuum cleaner trying to recollect all of the money! Wandering about the maze trying to catch you are the bank robbers. If they do manage to catch you, you will lose one of your lives. Each corner of the screen contains a room where your vacuum can become supercharged. While supercharged, you can destroy the bank robbers. You can only become supercharged four times, so use this sparingly. As you collect the money, your vacuum slowly becomes full. When your vacuum no longer has room to collect money, you will need to return to the vault in the center of the room to deposit the money before continuing on. When you have collected all of the money, you will move on to the next level. A second game variation is available where the maze walls are invisible making it more difficult to navigate.</story>

    <story>In Cosmic Chasm, the player&apos;s mission is to penetrate an alien planet underground maze and destroy the planet&apos;s power structure in the central cavern. It can be played by one or two players taking turns.The maze consists of several caverns connected by tunnels. The player is shown an overview map before entering each cavern. They have to choose the shortest route towards the centre. Each cavern contains several drones that should be destroyed. Exits to caverns deeper in the system are blocked and must be opened with a drill first. In the middle of each cavern is a trap that slowly expands, the player must avoid touching it at all costs. The further the player penetrates into the system, the faster the drones are moving. After placing the bomb in the centre cavern, the player has 15 seconds to escape the maze, preferably using the way they came in.The game uses three buttons- one for thrust, one for a shield to defend against the drones and one for firing. Points are awarded for destroying the central structure, successfully escaping and drilling through walls.</story>

    <story>Heads Up Action Soccer is a football game played in a slightly tilted side view perspective for one or two players. The game offers three difficulty grades. To win the game, the player has to get the ball into the opponents goal as often as possible within a certain time frame, while avoiding getting any balls into their own goal.Depending on whether the player&apos;s team has the ball, the control buttons change their functions. In offense, one button is used to pass/dribble while the other shoots the ball. When defending, one button can be used to cycle through currently available teammates. It is also possible to tackle the opponent currently having the ball in an attempt to separate them from it. The goalie is controlled by holding one button, and pushing the joystick up or down to slide the goalie along a vertical line in front of the goal.Due to the Vectrex only being able to display one colour, the two teams can only be discerned by their line brightness. When playing alone, the human player controls the brighter team. In a multiplayer match, player two controls the darker team.</story>

All the dots on a screen can potentially turn into Mines; once a Mine is shot, two dots on the screen will turn into medium-sized Mines, which will then turn into two small Mines when shot (note- for the most part; sometimes, perhaps due to a glitch, a medium-sized Mine will just hatch one small Mine). When all dots have been turned into Mines on a screen, the Minelayer will come out, laying Mines in its wake until the player destroys it.Making contact with anything will destroy the player&apos;s ship and the game will end once there are no more reserve ships left. The Escape function acts as Hyperspace, which moves the player&apos;s ship to a random area on the screen.</story>

On top of that if you destroy a entire circular layer of force field it will regenerate along with another layer! This makes it impossible for you to stay in the same spot, as the layers rotate in opposite directions you will inevitable destroy one before breaching and destroying the center. Being hit by anything will cause the loss of one of your four lives, however if you hit the Forcefields you&apos;ll only bounce off.</story>
