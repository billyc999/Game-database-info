A pile of colored tiles moves upwards on the screen as the player attempts to rearrange them to eliminate groups of three or more like types.

    <story>A compilation of the classic arcade games Gauntlet and Rampart brought onto the Game Boy Advance. Gauntlet is an action game where players choose characters and fight their way through hordes of enemies that assault them on the way to the end of the level. One or two players must make their way through 100 levels of mayhem and magic. The game features a choice of four characters to play with, each with different weapons. Thor the Warrior has a bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts. Ghosts, goblins and even the life-draining Death are among the enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest. Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route. Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces the character&apos;s energy level. Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to the player&apos;s score. Rampart is a game combining strategy and artillery action. Build your castle from Tetris-style pieces, place your cannons, bombard the enemy, try to repair, do it all over again. The original arcade release has a single-player and a two-player mode; later revisions incorporate three-player gameplay.</story>

    <story>A compilation of the classic arcade games Klax and Marble Madness brought to the Game Boy Advance. Klax is an action/puzzle game, the object is to catch assorted color falling tiles and create rows, columns, or diagonals of a single color. Each level requires a different pattern to be made, and the tiles fall faster, more at a time, and in an increasing number of colors as the game progresses. In Marble Madness the idea of this arcade game is deceptively simple- Guide a marble down a path without hitting any obstacles or straying off the course. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you&apos;re racing against the clock.</story>

    <story>A compilation of the classic arcade games Spy Hunter and Super Sprint brought to the Game Boy Advance. Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles). At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!). The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter. Super Sprint- Super Sprint is a racing game for one or two players, with the Arcade version allowing three players to race at the same time. Gameplay is from an overhead view of the racetrack. The racetracks start simple and gradually get more complicated, and may also feature obstacles ranging from traffic cones to tornadoes. Occasionally wrenches will appear in the roadway, and when collected they can be used after a race to power up your car with better tires, better acceleration or a higher top speed.</story>

    <story>Action Man- Robot Atak is based on the direct-to-DVD animated film of the same name, in turn based on the line of toys. To stop the evil Dr. X and his army of robots that have been attacking cities across the globe, Action Force seek out his secret hideout, Island X. Dropped on different parts of the island, Action Man, Redwolf and Flint must first find each other, and then put an end to the evil doctor&apos;s plans. Most of the game&apos;s 17 levels take the form of a side-scrolling platformer with a heavy action focus. To get to the level exit, the controlled character must jump pits and gaps, climb ledges and take out many enemies, different varieties of X&apos; robots and various animals native to the island- spiders, bats, even dinosaurs. Each character has slightly different abilities (until the finale, which hero is controlled depends on the level)- Native American Redwolf always carries his bow, while Action Man and Flint start most levels with only their fists. They can pick up weapons, though, including throwing discs (for Action Man only), several different guns (which can be further enhanced by timed power-ups) and a boomerang (for Australian Flint only). Only Flint can double jump. Picking up 50 Action Man icons gives an extra life. Regular extra lives and health power-ups are also available, and a reset checkpoint is available every few screens. Variety from the platform levels comes in two levels where Flint uses his dirt rider and Redwolf surfs the waves. These are seen from behind the heroes as they must avoid or blast away obstacles and collect Action Man icons. Action Man lives up to his name in a level where he rides a motorcycle up a volcano (shooting missiles at enemies and jumping across gaps) and another one where he straps helicopter blades to his back to fly towards the level end. Finally, there are several boss battles, including a fight against the spider queen, a fist fight(!) against a T. Rex and the final confrontation with Dr. X.</story>

In contrast to the open areas of the console versions this one features more linear levels and tight time limits. It also replaces the juice meter with the so-called grind meter which is filled up by performing stunts. Every grind decreases this meter and if it is empty no grinds can be performed at all. Of course grinds are an elemental move to beat the challenges. There is also a freestyle playing mode where the player can unlock new skaters. The soundtrack is licensed.</story>

Like other versions, the game is a side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Aladdin through locations from the movie like the city of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders, and Jafar&apos;s palace. Some locations not appearing in the film include a trippy, candy-colored world inside the Genie&apos;s lamp and an ancient pyramid. Enemies standing in Aladdin&apos;s way include the Sultan&apos;s guards, animals and various magical creatures. They can be dispatched by jumping on top of them or by throwing apples at them. Besides jumping and throwing, another one of Aladdin&apos;s abilities consists of him pulling out a blanket and using it to slow his fall. Besides the platform levels, the game also includes magic carpet rides as well as a bonus game played between levels- if Aladdin collects a golden scarab in a level, he can play a wheel of fortune for extra health, lives or continues.</story>

    <story>You&apos;re a little yellow alien. The FBI has shot down your ship while flying over planet Earth. And it, quite literally, lands right on their doorstep. After a series of FBI Agents swipe your ship, what option do you have other than to blow up everything in your path to get it back? Alien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them. The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin. Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible. Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill. To help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection. Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies. You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them. The GBA version of the game is identical in gameplay, however, with a few bosses removed (such as the robot bee and the FBI big-fisted tank robot). The PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 versions of the game include a special PDA Game with very simple-looking graphics. Your goal in this game is to kill all the agents by hopping on their heads, and then reach the exit. Included with this game is a level editor, allowing you to make your own levels and then send them to friends if you have the Xbox or Xbox 360 version.</story>

    <story>Altered Beast- Guardian of the Realms - Based on the arcade classic, it&apos;s a side-scrolling action game with all-new characters, enemies, and levels. You play as a dead guy who&apos;s been resurrected by Zeus for the purpose of rescuing the realms from an evil monster named Arcanon. There are 15 different realms to visit, and your job is to make your way past the dozens of monsters in each one in order to battle and defeat the boss creature waiting at the end of the level. Your attacks include a variety of kicks and punches, and you can jump or duck to avoid nearby enemies. One addition to this modern revamp is the inclusion of attack items that you can gather throughout each level that offer all sorts of useful abilities, such as regeneration, increased speed, and shields. Using a link cable, you can battle your friends with the creatures you collect in the story mode.</story>

    <story>Jake Long is an average Asian boy from New York, with a secret- he is the American Dragon, and can transform at will into a powerful dragon to protect the magical creatures of America. Leprechauns, Unicorns, Mermaids- all of these creatures (and more) are real, but living in hiding, away from public view. It&apos;s up to the American Dragon to protect them from the Huntsclan, a band of evildoers who have hunted dragonkind and magical creatures for generations. Rise of the Huntsclan! is a side-scrolling beat-em-up starring Jake Long, from the Disney cartoon series. As Jake, players can beat up evil doers such as trolls, imps harpies and other mischievous creatures out to give Jake a hard time. He can also use his skateboard by holding the R Button to travel more quickly. Jake can also build up his focus meter by collecting blue orbs - when full, he can briefly transform into the American Dragon, and destroy his foes with powerful fire attacks and flaming breath. Jake&apos;s friends, Fu Dog, Trixie and Spud, and Grampa can also be summoned in for their own special abilities. As well as this, Jake can select an ability to upgrade at the end of each level, such as how long his transformation lasts, how powerful his various attacks are, or his speed.</story>

When you are ready with your character, you can choose to practice in Rehearsal, or try out on Endurance, or to try the Competition. In Rehearsal, you can practice singing any unlocked songs. Endurance will take you through the entire song list, one after another, as the difficulty level continues to rise. How far can you go before your performance is too low to continue? In the Competition, you are competing against others as you work to win the competition. Once the list of competitors is narrowed down to the top 10, you will be able to see your opponents and watch replays of their performances. After each performance, the three judges will comment on your performance. To play, you must try to press the given key(s) at the right time. There are five levels you can get at each place you need to press the key(s). If you hit it right on, you get the highest ranking and have a chance to get a style bonus if you can do that 5 times in a row. If you hit it and are off by a little, you will get one of the other rankings, or the lowest ranking if you miss or press the wrong key. Sometimes you will also have to hold a press for a length of time and let up at the right moment. The game offers many songs, but only 2 voices for each song. If you are male, you get the male voice; if you are female, you get the female voice. The lyrics will appear as the song is sung, so if you want to learn the song as well as compete, you can.</story>

    <story>Warner Bros. Studios is in massive financial debt - one zillion dollars worth of debt, to be precise! And it&apos;s all because of Yakko, Wakko, and Dot! Their madcap destruction has caused this dire financial situation, and the CEO, Thaddeus Plotz, has issued an ultimatum- either deliver three feature films on time and as cheaply as possible...or be locked in the Water Tower forever! In Lights, Camera, Action!, the player controls all three Animaniacs, as well as Pinky and The Brain. Each Animaniac has their own abilities and drawbacks - for example, The Brain can activate complex switches, but cannot jump due to his large head, while Dot can glide through the air with her skirt, but refuses to push anything as it will damage her nails. It&apos;s up to the player to switch between each Animaniac as they make their way through each scene, performing the required tasks given by the director. The Animaniacs are also never in any real danger - they&apos;re only filming. However, they must always pick up film reels to keep the cameras rolling. If the player runs out of film, it&apos;s game over. Otherwise, if you fall into water or get hurt, you&apos;ll just have to restart the last scene that the director asked you to perform.</story>

There are eleven stages where the little bear explores the environment, searches for foods and collects paw prints that unlock pictures in a photo gallery and additional chapters. Later, two other animals can be controlled as well- a walrus that is also able to explore underwater environment, the fast Arctic fox able to hunt down rabbits and an orca whale. The levels consist of free-roaming environments, on land or underwater, where the animals need to gather food to avoid having the heart icon fade away. While playing 16 different mini-games can be accessed where the player can earn bronze, silver and golds awards to unlock additional chapters. These games include Ice Slide (obstacle course), Shuffle (slide to the center of a ring), Food Fight, Ice Flow Rodeo (control a broken piece of ice through rough currents), Survive the Cold (cross an icy area using shelters to hide from the cold), Catch-a-Seal, Ice Sheet, Clam Scavenge (find eight hidden clams), Herd Flow (guide an ice block without hitting anything), Walrus Hunt, Orca Race and more.</story>

    <story>Arthur and the Invisibles is an officially licensed game for the French film of the same name (Arthur et les Minimoys in French). Players assume the role of 10 year old Arthur. His grandmother is about to lose her house and Arthur wants to stop this. Instead of the conventional channels Arthur travels to the land of the Minimoys; minuscule creatures just a tenth of an inch tall. Here he searches for his grandfather&apos;s treasure together with princess Selenia. This treasure should save the house. But to find it they&apos;ll have to travel to the forbidden city ruled by the evil M. the Malicious. The Minimoy world consists of the house and its garden, but in an up-scaled size, since the characters are very small. Unlike the PC and console version, which is in 3D, the Game Boy Advance version uses a sidescrolling perspective. The player gets to play as both Arthur, Selenia and her little brother Betamesh. Each character has its own abilities. Arthur is more acrobatic, Selenia has a knife with which she can cut through foliage and Betamesh is smaller and can use this advantage to creep through smaller areas. The story in the game closely follows the script of the film.</story>

    <story>Astro Boy- Omega Factor is a side-scrolling action game based off a 2003 remake of Osamu Tezuka&apos;s classic Astro Boy anime and manga series from the 1960s. You play as the young, boylike robot Astro Boy, a true mechanical pacifist who&apos;s biggest dream is that one day humans and robots can coexist in peace. Armed with a strong punch, rocket powered feet and the ability to shoot laserbeams from your fingers, arms and behind, you set off on a quest against all sorts of evildoers from the Astro Boy series. The game has two distinctive types of levels- the more prevalent beat-em-up levels and the shooter-esque levels. During the beat-em-up levels you can walk around freely and your flying ability is limited to short bursts. The shooter levels differ from each other- sometimes you can float around the screen and shoot in both directions, other times you are flying in a set direction in a more on-the-rails fashion. The Omega Factor mentioned in the title is actually a simple upgrading system for your weapons. Every time Astro meets someone new (be they good or bad) he or she will be added to the Omega factor screen and Astro can upgrade one of his six weapons or abilities.</story>

    <story>It&apos;s tough being an intergalactic superhero when you&apos;ve got to finish your homework and make it in time to the basketball finals - but that&apos;s just what Atomic Betty, defender of the cosmos, has to do! Take care of the spoiled Penelope with the help of your friends while you&apos;re on earth, then blast off into space and combat the villainous genius, Maximus I.Q. (Evil Master Mind). Atomic Betty is a mix of the platform and puzzle genres, and plays very similarly to The Lost Vikings, in that you control three different characters simultaneously, each with varying abilities. However, because Atomic Betty is aimed at a younger audience, there are two notable differences- first, it is a lot more difficult to die, and second, the player only needs to get one character to the exit to successfully finish the level. When on Earth, the player controls one character that can finish the homework, one that can push or pull objects, and the last that can slide under narrow gaps. In Space, one character can repeatedly attack and use special gadgets, one can use a jetpack for a very high jump, and the last can grab items and enemies. In addition to the main levels, the game also features levels where the player must control the spaceship as it zooms through asteroid belts and high-speed space warps.</story>

Gameplay consists of brawling and puzzles. Each character has different moves, with each mission giving you different characters to control. While you directly control your main character, your secondary character can still assist in fights, and you can switch the primary and secondary characters at any time. The puzzles are based around your character&apos;s unique moves, and generally revolve around activating crystals.</story>

    <story>Based on the animated television program of the same name, Avatar- The Last Airbender follows the adventures of a group of kids living in an Asian-inspired fantasy world where the nations have been divided up according to the four classical elements- Air, Water, Earth, and Fire. Within each nation are people who can control that one element, known as benders. The Avatar is a person who can control all four elements, and is charged with keeping peace between the four nations. However, 100 years previous the Avatar had disappeared, making it possible for the Fire Nation to wage a war of conquest across the world. As the show begins, the new Avatar, Aang (originally an Airbender, hence the title of the series), has been found, and now he must travel the world, learning how to bend all four elements and fighting against the Fire Nation alongside his friends Katara (a Waterbender of the Water Tribe) and Sokka (her older brother). In the game, the player may choose one of four characters- Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Haru (an Earthbender). Each character&apos;s fighting style and abilities are unique, and new abilities can be gained as they earn experience by defeating enemies. Items are also available to assist the player, such as armor, chi, accessories, and healing potions. As an action/adventure game, the gameplay is viewed from top-down perspective, with the player battling enemies and searching for specific items required the complete the quests necessary to progress further into the game. The story unfolds over several chapters, and players cannot return to previous areas. Set between the first and second seasons of the show, the game follows Aang and friends as they investigate the disappearance of a young Waterbender, and find themselves in pursuit of an inventor named Lian the Maker, who has been forced to create dangerous machines for the Fire Nation. As they travel between the Water Tribe and Earth Kingdom, the characters battle Fire Nation soldiers, strange animals, and various machines</story>

    <story>Back To Stone is an isometric action game set in a world where humans have attained wisdom to overcome war and famine. However, someone traces down a black book and recites the words that unleash a horde of demons, vanquishing the humans. Some are kept alive as guinea pigs in dark experiments. One of their subjects, the nameless protagonist, managed to escape. He has been infused with a demonic essence that robs him from his human form, but grants him super strength and the ability to turn flesh into stone. The game provides at least a 10 to 15 hour-playing time, peppered with cinematics and dialogues. There are various objects throughout the quest in order to solve many enigmas and obtain magical powers. When things get harder, a small friendly helper will show up and guide the player through the dangerous world. This GBA game comes on a 32 Mb cartridge and offer about 20 different environments (desert, villages, ice lands, mazes, forest, swamp, lost cities…). Each environment has its own specificities of experiences and interactions (wind, water, sliding, moving pavement…). This world is inhabited by some 30 monsters and many Boss Master demons.</story>

    <story>Barbie and her friends head out to the city to visit a couple hotspots. These hotspots turn out actually contain some mini-games that Barbie and her friends can partake in. One or two players can choose to play as Ken, Barbie, Christie, Teresa, or (in the GBA version only) Lea, Kayla, and Becky. Each of the following mini-games has three difficulty levels (easy, medium, and hard). •There&apos;s an ice cream parlor with mini-game Four Scoops. Players try to create ice cream sodas by playing a Connect Four variant. •The music store contains the mini-game D.J. Booth, where players match compact discs back into their cases in this Concentration variant. The GBA features a 3x3, the PlayStation a 4x4 grid. •The jewelry store has the mini-game Gems and Jewels, where players are tasked with being the first to line up four gems that have either the same shape, color, size, or whether they&apos;re solid or hollow on a 4x4 grid. Players take turns, with one player choosing a gem for the other player to use and vice versa when it&apos;s the other players turn. •At the arcade, the mini-game Daisy Derby lets the player race a horse versus another horse. The mini game is basically a Hangman game where players have to guess the letters in a word. Correct guesses move the player&apos;s horse forward while incorrect guesses move the player&apos;s opponent&apos;s horse forward. •The beauty salon contains the mini-game Bubble Machine, which is Bust-A-Move variant where players shoot colored bubbles at other colored bubbles hoping to match three of the same color to make them disappear. •The dance studio contains the mini-game Conga Line, where players try to form the longest conga line in this Snake game. •The disco has the mini-game Groove &amp; Move where players make Skipper dance by pressing the directions the computer highlights. Players must be quick to press the correct directions to do the correct dance moves. •The park (GBA only) contains Tic-Tac-Toe played on a picnic blanket, which is the classic game of creating a line of three symbols on a 3x3 grid. •The beach (GBA only) contains Checkers, the classic board game, played in the American variant on an 8x8 board. •The farmers market (PlayStation only) contains Fruit Fallout, where fruit falls into baskets forming columns. Players have to connect 3 like fruits to make them disappear before the baskets overflow. The Info Booth (PlayStation only) contains the high scores and instructions on how to play all of the mini-games. On the GBA, the instructions can be looked at before each of the mini-games and high scores are not saved. The PlayStation version also includes voice acting for all characters.</story>

    <story>Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses is a 2D side-scrolling platformer based on the 2006 direct-to-video animated movie of the same name, with the story loosely based on the fairy tale The Twelve Dancing Princesses. The game is different from the PC/PS2 3D version Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses. Barbie is cast as Genevieve, one of the twelve princesses who live with their windowed father King Randolph in a castle. They live a frivolous life, so Randolph brings over his cousin Duchess Rowena to raise them as proper princesses. She makes their lives miserable however and one day Genevieve wakes up and discovers her father has been poisoned and the other eleven princesses have been locked up. Genevieve needs to explore different locations to free her fellow princesses. With the game being a platformer, she needs to jump to navigate areas and avoid enemies. Initially the gameplay is very basic, but by freeing the princesses, six abilities are provided gradually, such as a butterfly net to attack enemies, magic stilts to cross large gaps, ribbons to create staircases, a mallet to hit croquet balls and operate switches, putting down a book as an additional platform, and running faster. In the DS version the abilities are stored in the lower screen and can be activated by tapping them, changing the colour of Genevieve&apos;s dress. With new abilities more difficult environment based puzzles are introduced, for instance when Genevieve has to be guided through two parallel planes. She has three hearts that represent health and the game has some boss fights. There are several mini-games, for instance one with Genevieve&apos;s cat Twyla in a fixed-scrolling platform challenge, butterfly catching, ribbon racing, a time trial run etc. There are two difficulty levels and the unlocked mini-games can be accessed right away from the main menu. The game has a password function to continue playing. In the DS version the player sometimes needs to blow into the microphone to extinguish fires.</story>

    <story>Barnyard is based on the animated movie of the same name. It is set on a farm where all animals can talk and walk, but only when no humans are around. The player takes the role of a new arrival, either a male or female cow, who has to finds its place inside the community. While the basic gameplay mechanics are almost identical to the console version, many aspects are simplified, e.g. the overall size, the mini game complexity and the graphical presentation (top-down instead of behind-the-shoulder). The basic gist is that the player walks around freely in the unlocked portions of the farm, talks to other animals with exclamation points on their head and solves fetch quests for them. While some of those quests are mandatory to progress the plot, others are side content and only serve to earn money in order to buy decorations for the night festivities (there is a day/night circle and the character automatically goes to sleep at 2 a.m.). When entering more dangerous areas of the farm, there are enemies which take away life energy when touched. They can either be avoided or fought by shooting milk at them (which involves rotating the character so the udder aims in the enemy&apos;s direction). The main character has three stats which can be improved during the course of the game- life energy, milk capacity and running speed. The latter is important because the cow can only run a short amount of time before running out of breath, but later there is a bicycle which helps moving around. Additionally there are a few optional mini games.</story>

    <story>Trouble is brewing in Gotham City- The Joker has another nefarious plan for bringing down Batman. It begins with a break-in at the Gotham Museum and ends with the Joker falling from the Gotham Bridge, apparently to his death (as depicted in the first levels of gameplay). Now, Gotham&apos;s other supervillains, including Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy don&apos;t rest and want to fill the void left by the Joker. Thankfully, Batman is not alone in his efforts to stop them, as his trusted companions Robin and Batgirl are there to help. Batman- Vengeance for the GBA has the same basic story as its counterpart on consoles (and uses stills from that version&apos;s rendered sequences for story cutscenes), but differs in gameplay. Both games are inspired by the 1990s Batman animated TV series rather than the comics. The game has four different kinds of levels- In the side-scrolling levels, Batman runs and jumps from left to right, beating up various henchmen with kicks and punches. He can also use various gadgets- batarangs and smoke bombs to take out enemies and a grappling hook to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. In the Batmobile stages, viewed from the top, the Batmobile has to reach a goal within a certain time limit. Naturally, the road is filled with both traffic and other obstacles that take time from the clock or slow Batman down. Thankfully, the Batmobile is equipped with a gun that can take some obstacles out of the way. It&apos;s Robin and Batgirl&apos;s turn in the Batplane stages, which are similar to traditional side-scrolling shoot&apos;em&apos;ups. The Batplane has to be steered through an automatically scrolling landscape, filled with flying hazards and various guns. The plane can be made invulnerable for a short time by employing an energy shield, and it is also equipped with a gun to fight back. Finally, Robin goes at it solo in the so-called Puzzle stages. Viewed from the top, Robin must navigate a labyrinth of rooms and find the exit. Crates block the way that have to be moved in the correct order to free the path. Passwords and key cards must be found to open barriers. To gain access to areas behind holes that are too small to pass through, a remote-controlled robot called the Batcrawler can be used. These stages also have enemies to be defeated. Once the game has been finished in Story Mode, a password is given out for Advance Mode. Advance Mode features slightly different versions of the original levels with different goals- in the side-scrolling, Puzzle and Batmobile levels, three data disks must be collected and the end of the level reached before a timer runs out. In the Batplane levels, the Joker has placed three Pyro toys, which have to be destroyed, again before a timer runs out.</story>

    <story>In a twist for the series, Beyblade VForce- Ultimate Blader Jam is not based on spinning top battles. Instead, the game bears a closer resemblance to Marble Madness. In each level, you&apos;ll need to get your top to the exit, negotiating narrow paths, and watching out for enemies. There are collectibles in each level, called Bit Beasts, and each level has a par time to beat. Of course, you&apos;re controlling a top, not a marble, and so you have a spin gauge. The lower this gauge gets, the harder your top will be to control, and the closer you are to losing. The story features a group of mysterious strangers who are systematically beating the world Beyblade champions. This game also has a multiplayer mode. Battle against a friend in the battle mode, and try to knock your opponent&apos;s Beyblade off the level, or just stay spinning longer. There is also a race mode, which challenges you to reach the exit before your opponent.</story>

    <story>Bionicle- Maze of Shadows is a top-down action game set in the LEGO Bionicle universe and based on the book of the same name. The game features six playable characters, six stages and multiplayer features. The Toe Metru, six great heroes, are looking for a means to awaken their sleeping people, the Matoran. They need to venture into the underground labyrinth Maze of Shadows, where the vicious Rahi lurk and filled with traps and puzzles. The player controls all of the six Toa Metru, and he has to use their individual special skills to overcome the challenges thrown at him. During the course of the game, each Toa Metru can enhance gis special skills, each representing a different element (ice, air, earth, fire, stone, and water). While the standard gameplay takes place from a top-down view, combat is played out in turn-based fashion similar to Golden Sun.</story>

    <story>Released as the handheld companion to the 3D BIONICLE, this game obviously has different gameplay, such as the lack of a save feature, using passwords instead, and a limited number of lives, after which the game resets. An improvement is that all versions of the Toa, including Toa, Toa Nuva, and Takanuva, are playable. Some basic story elements are kept the same, however. A set number of Matoran have to be rescued in a level so that they can help the Turaga construct a key to the boss room. Players use their Elemental powers to fight enemies, but their powers are limited. Once their meter runs out, they have to find a power-up. Rescued Matoran are taken back to a shrine near the beginning of the stage. Platforming is also involved, as moving platforms, falling platforms, cliffs, and jumping are included.</story>

    <story>In the GBA version of Bionicle Heroes, based on the LEGO Bionicle franchise, players take on the guise of the TOA Anika team. Set on the island of Voya Nui, they need to retrieve the Mask of Life, stolen by the Piraka race who also enslaved the Matoran, the native inhabitants, in the process. Unlike the console and the DS versions, a top-down perspective is used. The game takes place on six zones of the island, followed by a final showdown. The player starts as a TOA of Fire, but by completing zones and killing the level boss, additional masks can be collected- Air, Stone, Ice, Earth and Water. Each TOA has a primary and secondary weapon based on the mask&apos;s elemental nature, with specific features. During the levels, there are also weapon upgrades to be found. The second weapon is limited by an energy meter which needs some time to recharge. Each zone requires a specific TOA guise, but in the Free Play mode completed levels can be revisited and players can then switch between the forms at any time to use different abilities. TOAs can strafe while fighting - there is an option to face enemies automatically or to control this manually. TOAs are assisted by proto-spawn orbs, sidekicks that circle around the hero and fire at enemies. The orbs are chased off when they take too much damage, but they can also be upgraded based on the 6 elements and the weapons can be customized. Players can define to have the orbs fire in spread patterns or rapid bursts, lock on targets with fire, cause explosions, fire through shields or do double damage. Additional attacks are provided through elemental runes, which provide a one-time limited effect, such as freezing enemies, activating a lightning shield, smashing enemies with spikes from the ground, temporary invulnerability, full health and regeneration, and a fire blast. By destroying objects and buildings in the environment, blue, gray or gold LEGO pieces are revealed, providing health and bonus points. The TOAs also need to use pieces to build bridges, platforms, elevators, turrets, barricades or moving platforms. At the end of each zone, the rank and score is shown. Based on the performance or specific actions, there are 12 medals to collect, of which a few can only be found in the Free Play mode. Each zone contains secret cheat words. Upon discovering them, they are added to a cheat menu. They allow to play as a golden TOA or to obtain a new mask with a sombrero, open up a music jukebox, provide a hidden Cluck gun or grant invincibility or one-shot kills.</story>

The inbuilt sunlight sensor on the cartridge detects levels of sunlight, which determines not only the time of day you play, but also acts as ammo for your weapon. Run out of sunlight, or play in the dark, and evil will have the upperhand. Many elements to the sunlight can have an effect on how the game plays out. For example, you can only replenish ammo during play by standing outside or, if indoors, under light from a window. Sunlight batteries can be collected during play to store sunlight, so you can play at night.</story>

    <story>In this portable installment of Activision&apos;s long standing hunting simulation series players start a game by customizing a character, selecting age, hair, and snazzy hunting couture, as well as hunting skills, such as aiming, accuracy, strength, and stealth. Then they set out on an hunting adventure, with a view to pot a grizzly bear or wildest moose. Two modes are available a Quick Hunt and a Career Hunt. Fear not, the later is hardly social commentary, rather it is a goal oriented story mode, while the former will allow the player to select one of the various breath taking North American hunting and persecute the local fauna to their heart&apos;s content. The story mode revolves around allowing the player&apos;s grizzled uncle Pete live vicariously through the them by accomplishing Pete&apos;s dream of entering the Hunter&apos;s Hall of Fame. Hunters wishing to achieve such fame must slay one animal in each of the 65 hunting regions in the country. Poor Pete was three kills shy of bloodsport immortalization, then he broke his leg... The player must accomplish the entire task, for Pete&apos;s sake. Gameplay consists of selecting a region to go hunting in and then wandering about looking for the correct animal in your bestiary to knock off. In Alaska for instance the player may be tasked with gunning down a moose. During the aimless wandering and Promethean loneliness sections of the game the player will have time to select the proper guns and ammo for their quarry as well as apply various lures and fatally seductive moose (etc.) mating cries. When the animal sought is kind enough to appear, at the end of a long trail of tracks, the player may whip out their rifle going into a first person, crosshair-grafted-directly-to-the-eye style, mode. When the player is content with a corpse it will be weighed and the level will end, until they choose to return to try and bag a heftier score. Being sentimental the game provides the player with trophies of their kills in the form of taxidermied animal heads for which a rustic and picturesque log cabin has graciously been provided. </story>

    <story>Normally a solar eclipse isn&apos;t a dangerous event, but for Soma Cruz being sucked through a portal and into Dracula&apos;s castle during one will turn his day into a total nightmare. As Soma you must venture through the castle and find a way out. As you do so, you will discover the true meaning behind the event, and why Dracula has risen yet again. Although set in the future, all of the weapons and hazards are the same or similar to those seen in past Castlevania titles. Soma can find or buy weapons of all types such as swords, spears, and axes. Through his mysterious power of Dominance Soma can take the souls of his enemies and use their powers as his own, providing passive stat boosts, powerful magic, or even summoning them forth to fight on his behalf. Dracula&apos;s castle is a single continuous building, and as Soma&apos;s power of Dominance grows and he acquires more monster souls to power abilities he can bypass obstacles that were previously insurmountable. Players can link up with a friend&apos;s copy of Castlevania- Aria of Sorrow to trade souls between them.</story>

    <story>Count Dracula has been resurrected and evil will reign supreme unless he is stopped. As Nathan Graves, you&apos;ll hunt down the Count and use your whip and a variety of special items to destroy his minions. Battle your way through Dracula&apos;s castle and rid the world of his evil once again. Castlevania- Circle of the Moon is the first of the series to be based on the action/RPG structure of Castlevania-Symphony of the Night rather than the level-based action style of all previous Castlevania games. Dracula&apos;s castle is a single continuous building, and as Nathan discovers artifacts within it he gains new abilities that allow him to explore more of it. While Nathan can only use his Killer Whip as a weapon, he can find and equip different kinds of armor and accessories that change his stats. Unique to this entry in the series is the Dual Set-up System, where a combination of two cards will give Nathan unique magical abilities. For example, equipping a fire type card with a whip card will give the Killer Whip a fire attribute, while equipping it with a summon card will let Nathan summon a fire demon to attack onscreen enemies.</story>

    <story>Castlevania- Harmony of Dissonance is the second Castlevania game to appear on the Game Boy Advance. Juste Belmont and friend Maxim are drawn to the newly resurrected Dracula&apos;s Castle in order to save their mutual friend Lydie, although it remains to be seen who will be saving whom. The game is another Castlevania in the action/RPG style of the previous Castlevania- Symphony of the Night and Castlevania- Circle of the Moon. Juste is able to dash at will similar to Alucard, and use subweapons like the axe and holy water. By combining subweapons with magic tomes located throughout the castle he can increase both their power and their properties, such as turning the holy water into a rain that damages every monster onscreen, or turning a Bible into a holy shield that circles him. Juste can equip many kinds of armor and accessories, and he can modify his Vampire Killer whip with different tips that change its elemental property or increase its power. As an optional side quest, Juste can also find furniture and furnishings left around the castle and decorate a room with them, although there is no reward for doing so beyond a nice looking room.</story>

The player has at his disposal all the key abilities of the cat-lady as seen in the movie, and must traverse levels full of platforms and bad guys, and climbing walls, occasionally. The game opens with a tutorial mission and then switches to a series of images resembling comic-strips that explain how Patience Phillips became Catwoman. The player then goes through the 24 levels of the game mostly jumping, climbing and sometimes fighting. The look of the graphics aims toward a comic-book feel instead of the more realistic looking 3D of the console and PC versions.</story>

    <story>Chicken Shoot is a gallery shooting game based on free 2003 flash game of the same name. The player, controlling Chicken Bill, shoots all the chickens that appear on the 2D hand-drawn screens, shown from a first-person perspective. There are 3 game modes- 1. Arcade- shoot a specific number of chickens to move on to the next level. There is no time limit and the enemies attack by throwing eggs towards the screen. There is no time limit and when Chicken Bill&apos;s 100 points are depleted, the game is over. 2. Classic- the same gameplay as Arcade, requiring a certain number of chickens to be shot, but now with a time limit added. Certain chickens carry time packages, providing time bonuses. 3. Multiplayer- score more points than your opponent in a set amount of time. There are three difficulty levels and support for high scores (not saved after powering off). At the end of each level, statistics are shown based on the shots fired, hits, accuracy, general score, and energy or time remaining. There are different types of weapons (pistol, shotgun, uzi, machine gun, laster, flame thrower and bombs) and a limited amount of ammo. During gameplay, accuracy is shown through a thermometer on the screen. When it rises to the top, all hits are awarded with double points.</story>

    <story>The CIMA aliens feed on humankind hopes and dreams. They build elaborate mazes and trap people inside them as a way of producing their food. A force called Gate Guardians was created to protect the population from this menace. Three Guardians were on a train delivering settlers to a distant station, when suddenly a portal for another dimension appeared and transported everyone to a strange moon-like place. The Guardians must find the way home and bring back safely every passenger. CIMA- The Enemy is a RPG with strategic elements. Although labeled a RPG, the game doesn&apos;t have the usual trappings of the genre- there is no levelling up, nor any form of currency or shops to buy equipment. Instead, the game is focused on the management of a huge party of characters (16 by the end of the game). The main objective is to guide these civilians on mazes, using their unique abilities to overcome obstacles and defeat enemies. Each character has a special trait that can be used to the player&apos;s advantage (a medic that concots health potions, a blacksmith that upgrades armor and weapons, etc). Pressing the R button brings up a cross with the party portraits at each point and a multicolor cross on the middle. The characters can be individually guided by selecting their portraits or moved in groups by selecting the multicolor cross. Three way-points can be set for easier manouvering (almost a necessity, the characters have a tendency to get stuck on corners and walls). The groups to be moved can be selected by hitting the L button (a cross with numbered tents at each point appears). One crucial gameplay aspect is the amount of trust the party members have on their Guardians. Each character has a gauge that shows the amount of trust they have. This number increases and decreases according to actions within the game. If a character is hurt his/her trust decreases, and a red heart with an arrow pointing downwards appears over his/her head. Likewise, if a character sees a guardian slaying a monster the opposite effect happens, and a green heart with an upwards arrow appears over his/her head. Trust is important because the characters only cooperate with the Guardians when they have the right amount of it. Using the START button brings up a cross with the following functions- ? The south point has a wrench icon. It accesses the game options menu that can save the game (at any time), quit it or change the text speed. ? The north point has a face with a speech ballon icon. It is the dialogue screen, where the characters speak about the situation and how they are feeling. ? The middle of the cross has a sword and a potion icon. It is the inventory screen, where potions and other items can be equipped on a cross. The main character&apos;s inventory cross can be accessed in-game by pressing the A button. The other characters use items automatically when needed (they don&apos;t equip them automatically, though). ? The east point has a stylized file of people icon. This is the group screen, where characters can be organized in groups for easier management and manouvering. ? The west point has a stylized body and heart icon. It is the statistics screen, where the player can check what weapons, stats and armor each character has. The top-left of the main game screen shows the health points bar of the main character. Below that occasionally is shown a health bar of any near party member being attacked. When a party character is about to expire, a jewel is displayed besides the main character&apos;s health bar, and an alarm sound is played. Death of any party member ends the game instantaneously.</story>

These include the basic Survival Mode, where you must remove as many gems from the playing field as possible; Versus Mode has you battling a range of thieves in one-on-one Columns games; and Flash Columns has you attempting to remove the flashing gem from an already packed field of gems in a limited amount of time. The aim of the game is simple. In the style of Tetris, the playing field fills up with magic gems, each of varying colour. Match 3 or more of the gems and they will disappear. The more you remove in Survival mode, the higher your end ranking becomes. The magic gems themselves can be found by defeating the thieves in VS mode, getting as far as possible in Survival mode (and collecting as high a ranking as possible) or completing Flash Columns mode.</story>

    <story>Crash Bandicoot makes his first appearance on the Game Boy Advance, in this, his 5th adventure against arch nemesis, Dr. Neo Cortex. This time Cortex has shrunk the world down to a tiny size and it is up to Crash to explore the 20 levels full of dangerous creatures and terrain to collect crystals that will (hopefully) change the world back to its normal size. Crash explores 4 worlds, split into 5 levels. Levels range from side-scrolling action to underwater swimming and 3D chase sequences (similar to those in the original Playstation series) designed using the GBA&apos;s unique FX features to create a 3D illusion. You will also play flying shoot &apos;em up levels, a boss levels at the end of each world, and the usual extra bonus levels and secret items.</story>

The GBA version was licensed separately, and only the characters remind of the Crazy Frog world. The typical music and soundbites are not present. Only singleplayer is available, and no story at all. The main game modes are Grand Prix, two modes based on checkpoints (alone or against opponents), and Last Man Standing where the last one drops after each lap. Grand Prix consists of three classes based on different speed, with three cups each, and and extra cup. Controls allow for speeding up, braking, using items to hinder your opponents (mines, nails, boxing gloves...), and there is a button to drift through the corners. Record times can be saved on the Battery Backed RAM.</story>

    <story>CT Special Forces is a side scrolling platform shooter that has a superficial similarity to the games of the Metal Slug series. The player controls an operative of a counter-terrorist force on a mission around the globe to stop terrorist activity and arrest its leaders. The digital pad moves the character, while the B button shoots the weapon and the A button makes the character jump. The character can&apos;t shoot downwards. The L trigger cycles through the inventory (displayed on the top-left corner of the screen) and the R trigger throws grenades (when they are available). By selecting an ammunition type, the character uses the corresponding weapon (gas canisters for the flamethrower, machine gun pents for that weapon, etc). The default rifle has an infinite number of bullets. Other items include a grappling rope and a pair of handcuffs to arrest surrended enemies. Ammunition and health packs are scattered throughout the levels, as are proximity mines and assorted enemies. The regular gameplay is occasionally broke by mini-games and entirely different sections- when the character collides with a reticule placard, the game switches to a first-person shooting gallery where the player has to shoot down a certain number of terrorists and rescue the hostages. When colliding with a parachute, two gauges with a red line on the middle appear on the screen. The one on the left measures the position of the falling character and the one on the right measures height. The character must be guided to the right spot, and the shooting button must be pressed when both gauges reach the red bar. Some mission stages change the game to a vertical shooter that recalls Tiger-Heli and similar games, where the player controls a helicopter viewed from the top. The game has 4 missions, each with its own theme- snow mountain, desert, jungle and a city. A password system is provided (the password is displayed after the completion of every mission).</story>

    <story>CT Special Forces- Back to Hell is the sequel to CT Special Forces and the story picks up right where the last game ended. Having destroyed the terrorist group Network the CT Special Forces are going back to do training missions, but more and more reports about new terror threats keep popping up. Could this be a new terrorist organization, or maybe Network is back for a second round? It&apos;s up to the CT Special Forces to stop the treat of terrorism once again! The game plays in 5 different game modes. The majority is made up of side scrolling platform action, somewhat similar to the Metal Slug games, where you pick up various weapons, grenades and even a tank to squash the terrorist threat. Every now and then you&apos;ll come across a wooden sign with a cross-hair on it. Doing so will change the game into first person view, where you have to shoot terrorists and save hostages. Sometimes you&apos;ll find a parachute pack, and you&apos;ll have to play a mini game where you have to make two meters align to make a drop successfully with your parachute. There are also two kinds of helicopter stages. One is a top down shoot&apos;em up, where you have to bomb land targets and gun down enemy helicopters. The other one is a side scrolling chopper rescue game, where you have to save hostages and bring them to your base, while gunning down enemies across the stage.</story>

    <story>Released in conjunction with a 3D update of the classic arcade game on consoles, the Game Boy Advance version is also an update of the original, but retains its side-scrolling gameplay. The cartridge includes several variants of the game. The main mode is called XGP. Its basics are the same as in the original- The player&apos;s spaceship flies left or right over a scrolling landscape that wraps around after a few screens. The goal is destroy all invading aliens before they can capture the humans sitting on the ground. Besides updated graphics with various backgrounds and sprites for the enemies and humans, there are other differences as well- players can select from different ships, all with slightly different weapons and ratings for shields and speed. The XGP mode offers six different levels to complete. It can also be played by two players over the System Link. The cartridge also includes Classic mode, which is a port of the original arcade game. Finally, XG mode is the same gameplay-wise as Classic, but has been updated with graphics similar to the XGP mode.</story>

    <story>Defender of the Crown puts you in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England. After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, you start the game with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well. The game has several different styles- You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack another territory/castle. The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original appeal and quality.</story>

You should also avoid running into things very much as your car will explode if you have too much damage. If you are smart, you can slow your opponents down a lot by running into them in certain ways, however. Play the game in quick race, or tournament mode, or choose to play a friend in link mode. Race each track and try to set records as you strive for first place in each track and your name in the high scores list. If you play in the tournament mode, you can buy upgrades for your car between each race. This is not an option for the quick race mode.</story>

    <story>Dexter&apos;s Laboratory- Chess Challenge is a game based on the popular cartoon TV show of the same name. This chess game is a game mainly aimed at children who aren&apos;t normally interested in chess or board games and would be more easily convinced into learning how to play by playing a video game starring characters from the hit show. Players can choose from 4 selectable characters from the cartoon series and there are also 4 different gameplay types to choose from. Tournament Mode In Tournament Mode, the player begins as a character and has to fight the other three characters in a chess match. It&apos;s pretty simple to figure out, since it&apos;s just normal chess. Versus Mode Versus Mode is a two-player mode which can be played with one GBA, where both players alternate control of the console or it can be played with two GBAs using the Link Cable. Players can choose their character and play chess. Quick Play This plays just like tournament mode except players only face one person. Players choose their own character and play a single game of chess against the computer. Puzzle mode The most complex game mode. The player has to clear the chess board by using his or her wits and different combinations of moves. This is the main part of the game. There are many different levels where the player has to find the correct solution.</story>

    <story>The Digimon prove themselves to be versatile creatures as they hop in cars and compete against each other in this kart-style racing game. The third Digimon game for the Game Boy Advance, Digimon Racing has all the features you&apos;d expect out of a racing game. There&apos;s a good variety of colorful and light-hearted tracks (15 in all, including a wide variety of themes such as jungles, deserts, busy city streets, ice tracks, and gravel-covered hills), nearly a dozen Digimon to pick from and unlock, and several gameplay modes ranging from cup races to time trials. A handful of boss races round out the action, and provide a challenge for players. The twist to this game comes as the racers collect energy on the track to digivolve into upgraded versions of themselves. Once you&apos;ve digivolved, you can use additional offensive powers to further hamper your opponents and keep your own Digimon ahead of the others. While the single-player game will keep you busy for a while with its many modes and characters, Digimon Racing really shines in the multiplayer arena. Since it includes support for up to four players using the link cable or wireless adapter, the multiplayer experience is the real highlight of the game.</story>

    <story>Disney Sports Soccer is the first game in the series of Konami/Disney collaborations that put Disney characters into sports simulations. The Soccer entry is based on Konami&apos;s Winning Eleven/ISS series, offering a similarly complex simulation of the sport crossed with more arcade-like features. The game features eight different teams, each captained by characters like Mickey, Donald and Goofy. Three game modes are included- exhibition games (for up to four players), Dream Cup and Challenge Cup. The Dream Cup is a knockout tournament, while the Challenge Cup asks players to take on all other teams in the game successively. The game features the setting of formations and strategies and upgrading player&apos;s abilities. </story>

    <story>A new theme park is about to be opened by Uncle Scrooge, until Dr. Nickel arrives on the scene, taking over the power systems and scattering magic power all over the park. In order for the park to be opened, it&apos;s up to Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Daisy to find the magical powers and return the park back to the way it was. In order to do this, the gang must complete various party games while travelling along the game board. Players take turns to role the dice and move their character. Certain parts of the board will open up mini-games, which must be completed to move on, and the winner is the one with the most magical power stars, which are gained by landing on blue spaces on the board. There are four boards, each with their own theme based on an amusement park ride. Up to four players can play using the one console, or play with four consoles to challenge each other in a set of mini-games.</story>

    <story>Dogz along with Catz, is the first installment of the Petz series in the DS. The player starts off by choosing a dog from a large selection of 18 different breeds that come in many colors. The dog can be taken out for walks, entered in competitions, and can even be thrown parties with all the other dogs in the neighborhood that you meet on your daily stroll. Taking good care of the dog does come with its rewards. The player will receive gifts and presents to decorate his or her room, as well as toys and things to buy at the pet store for the new puppy. In the DS version the controls are slightly different. With the voice recognition feature, the player can call the dog to come to the avatar, as well as teaching it new tricks and commands. With the touch screen feature, the player can write in a diary about his or her day with the puppy. Lastly, with the networking feature, the player can share puppy mini-games with friends. All this and more. </story>

    <story>Donald Duck Advance is the GBA version of Goin&apos; Quackers, released on multiple other systems as a 3D platformer. Like the GBC version, the GBA release is a traditional 2D side-scroller. The storyline is the same as in the other versions- Merlock has kidnapped Daisy Duck and Donald tries to rescue her with the help of Gyro Gearloose&apos;s teleporter. Donald must move through four environments, each consisting of shorter levels- Duckie Mountain, Duckburg, Magica De Spell&apos;s manor and Merlock&apos;s temple. The goal in most levels is to collect three energy spheres, which will make the level exit open up. To get to them, Donald must take out or evade many enemies, jump over dangerous gaps and brave other hazards. To do so, he can attack, jump on top of enemies and even double jump. He can also start running, a skill used to jump farther or to survive in one of the chase levels. One level in each of the four worlds differs from the norm in that Donald either has to flee from an enemy or try to catch something. Each level features several setback points for restarting upon loss of a life. The levels include a lot of stars that Donald can collect. Collecting 100 awards a life and collecting all stars in all levels unlocks a secret bonus. Progress in the game is stored via passwords.</story>

    <story>King K. Rool has stolen Donkey Kong&apos;s banana stash, and Donkey Kong needs your help to get them back. In search of K. Rool, the Kremling horde impedes your progress. Kremlings, crocodile-like creatures, include Kritters (they succumb to a simple jump on the head), Krushas (they are virtually indestructible), and others. There are also other enemies that block your path, such as beavers, snakes, vultures. Leading them are dastardly bosses, including Very Gnawty, Necky, Bumble B, and Dumb Drum, and they all bar the way with their own special blend of villainy. Donkey Kong is joined by Diddy Kong- these two primates differ significantly. For example, Donkey Kong is generally stronger; he can destroy most enemies with a single jump and can lift barrels straight over his head to throw them farther. On the other hand, Diddy is faster and not as strong as Donkey; he can run really fast and do cartwheels. Diddy carries barrels in front of him, creating a shield against frontal attacks. The game is split into different worlds, which are split into different levels. Each level contains bonus areas, where one can collect bananas, medallions, and lives. At the end of each world is a boss, which is usually a larger version of a minor enemy.</story>

    <story>In this sequel to the original Doom, you play the same hero - the last remaining space marine. After having single-handedly saved Mars from demonic threat, you return to Earth, only to find out that the demons have already invaded it, killed all its inhabitants or turned them into demons. It&apos;s your task to kill all the demons and to save the Earth. Doom II looks and plays very similarly to its predecessor, utilizing the same 3D graphical engine with 2D sprites for enemies. The gameplay once again consists entirely of navigating the hero from first-person view through 3D environments and shooting at the demons while attempting to find your way out by flipping switches and looking for keys. Unlike in Doom, which is divided into three episodes, the 30 levels of Doom II (plus the 2 secret levels) form one long episode. You have the same weapons as in the first Doom, plus a new one- a super shotgun. There are also some new demons in this sequel, such as the chaingun-toting Heavy Weapon Dudes, the skeletal Revenants who launch homing missiles and the Arch-Viles who have a highly damaging fire attack. There is also one new power-up, a Megasphere which boosts your health and armor to the max.</story>

Dr. Sudoku features 1,000 puzzles crafted by the leading developer of Sudoku, Skynet Corporation of Japan. If you are new to the game, have no fear - in addition to readily available hints, Dr. Sudoku has a tutorial mode that will guide you through the game. You can also ask the doctor to verify if a puzzle is actually solvable. Another feature is Original Mode that allows you to create your own puzzles (this allows you to transfer puzzles you see in the newspaper onto your GBA).</story>

Based on the earliest manga chapters (before the series turned into Dragon Ball Z series), players fight their way through platform levels, bashing countless goons and bosses inspired by pivotal events and characters from the series. While the game&apos;s levels are straightforward brawls, special duels and tournament sequences play like classic fighting games, albeit with simplified controls. Goku can punch, kick and use his magic staff. After a certain point in the game, getting the Flying Nimbus, he receives the ability to engage into air combat. After completing the story mode, duel characters become available for customizable one-on-one bouts. Additional characters and mini-games can be unlocked by satisfying special requirements, e.g. completing the story mode unlocks Goku&apos;s fiend Krillin as a playable character.</story>

    <story>Taiketsu is another game adaptation that is based on the famous Dragon Ball manga series that were written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama. The current Dragon Ball game features the following options- 1. One Player- Option that allows you to compete as one of the 15 Dragon Ball fighters in the modes available. 1. Tournament- You start with 7 fighters but can unlock more to reach a total of 15. All fighters have the same combos and moves (like block, throws, ki blasts, etc.) and a set of 3 unique attacks that do more damage to the opponents. There’s also a combo of buttons that if pressed allows the battle to take place on the air. When on air you can’t use any of your current fighter’s moves but instead you must press rapidly the buttons that appear at the bottom of the screen in order to inflict damage to the opponent. When completing this mode you either get money as a prize or a new character is unlocked. 2. Endurance- Mode in which you have to fight a set number of opponents with only one life bar. 3. Time Challenge- Just like Tournament mode you fight a number of opponents with the exception that here you must do the least possible time. Again just like the Tournament mode if you complete the Time Challenge you either get money as a prize or unlock a new character. 4. Sparring- Here you can select any of the fighters and practice their moves. 5. Endurance 2x- Same as Endurance mode apart from the number of opponents which is doubled this time. The current mode is unlocked via the Z-Store. Multiplayer- By teaming up with another player via the link cable you can fight two opponents controlled by the CPU. Z-Store- The place where you can spent the money you have earned to buy images, character bios, bonus settings (make both fighters invisible, one hit instant death and others), etc.</story>

    <story>Dungeons &amp; Dragons- Eye of the Beholder is a classic dungeon crawler that challenges the player to lead a party of adventurers on a quest for fame and fortune in a world based on Forgotten Realms, a Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe. The party will scour the dark underbelly of Waterdeep for an evil source of power that threatens the streets above. Nary an hero would dare step into these dungeons alone, so the player must create a party of up to six adventurers from four base classes (Wizard, Rogue, Cleric and Fighter) and seven races (Human, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Moon Elf, Lightfoot Halfling, Rock Gnome and Shield Dwarf). All are based on character types from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition license. The first-person view draws the player into the role of adventurer. A handy auto-map feature helps to navigate the complex mazes of slime-covered walls and hidden passages. For the turn-based battles, the view switches to an isometric overhead perspective. Each character can be assigned commands for moving, attacking and spell-casting. Characters can also learn over 100 unique skills, feats, and spells that are straight out of the Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition rules. As with all RPGs, success depends on constantly upgrading equipment, assigning new spells and reordering the group. Over 100 items, both magical and ordinary will keep the player adventuring for hours.</story>

    <story>Dynasty Warriors Advance is a Game Boy Advance adaptation of the Dynasty Warriors franchise. Based on the Three Kingdoms period of ancient China, it takes place at the end of the Han Dynasty during 190 A.D. As the previous government collapses, warlords rise up and fight among one another, eventually establishing three powerful kingdoms- Wei, Wu and Shu. Generals from each of these nations spend the next 100 years fighting among one another, each trying to become the dominant power. Dynasty Warriors Advance is a top-down turn-based strategy board game, but with a focus on action combat. Since it is based on the earlier Dynasty Warriors titles, many of the same concepts carry over. Players begin by choosing one of three available characters from the lands of either Wu, Shu or Wei. Each character has their own unique storyline and missions. A briefing is given for each mission detailing specific objectives before allowing the player to equip themselves with weapons and skills at the camp. Once begun, the player moves the designed number of spaces (determined by movement) around the board. If an enemy player is encountered, the game shifts to a top-down action fighting mode. Here the player uses one button to attack, another button to charge and another to unleash a misou special attack once it is powered up. Misou energy is charged by successful attacking enemy units. The player&apos;s success against the enemy unit will determine the unit&apos;s heath and will be destroyed completely if all of it&apos;s units are destroyed. Some enemy units contain not just soldiers but enemy generals who have their own special moves and greater health. Many missions feature specific objectives rather than just defeating all enemies.</story>

    <story>An ordinary average earthworm named Jim goes about his normal daily life, cruising around avoiding crows and doing other general worm-like things. Jim is suddenly struck by a very large ultra- high- tech- indestructible- super- space- cyber- suit. Through sheer luck, Jim rests safely in the neck ring of the suit. Suddenly, the ultra-high-tech space particles of the suit begin interacting with Jim&apos;s soft wormy flesh. A radical light-speed evolution takes place. Jim soon realizes he is in control of the suit. Gameplay is similar to the first game, with Jim jumping and running through the levels. There are 5 weapons more than the original game to collect. Characters like Princess Whats-Her-Name and Psy-Crow appear.</story>

    <story>Ecks vs. Sever is the amongst the first FPSes to be featured on the Game Boy Advance. The game tells the story of Ecks, an ex-FBI Agent whose orders are to hunt down the beautiful assassin named Sever. As the cat-and-mouse-hunt progresses, both agents will find out that they are mere pawns in a larger government conspiracy... In the Single Player mode, the player can choose wether he wants to play as Ecks or Sever. The choice makes a radical difference in the single-player campaign. As Ecks, your orders are to chase Sever, whilst as Sever, you have to evade him. The levels for both characters tend to be the same, but with different objectives, and different locations for both characters. As an example, the orders of Sever are to hunt down and kill a government agent whilst as Ecks, your orders are to prevent the assassination. During this level, both characters will encounter each other. As Ecks, you&apos;ll have to try and snipe Sever whilst evading her grenades. When you play this level as Sever, you&apos;ll have to throw grenades at Ecks, whilst avoiding his sniper fire. The game also has a multi-player mode for up to 4 players with three different modes, which are Deathmatch (Every man for himself), Assassination (one player is the assassin who has to hunt down the VIP who&apos;s being protected by bodyguards) and Bomb kit (Try to gather all parts of a bomb before the other players do).</story>

    <story>This platformer is based on the hit 2003 movie starring Will Ferrell who played a boy who was raised by elves in the North Pole and became a large elf comparatively. At 30 years of age, Buddy goes on a journey to New York to find his real father and a place where he can fit in. The game&apos;s release was timed to come out the following 2004 holiday season with the dvd release and contains the choice of 5 languages. The main game is a side-scroller where you guide Buddy as he makes his way across icebergs while avoiding chasms and polar bears, dodges Manhattan traffic, and more. There are 10 missions based on the movie&apos;s events as he journeys to also help Santa and save Christmas. You must collect missing sleigh parts, letters (to spell New York in one level) or parcels. You will be penalized falling into the icy water or getting hit by a car which drains your health. To restore it, you jump for lollipops and candies, Buddy&apos;s favorite foods. There are also 3 mini-games available from the start menu- Snowman Building is like Sokoban, Santa Says is a memorization game, and Cobbler&apos;s Workshop has you matching elves&apos; shoes to put them in boxes. Plus, more minigames are available within the game.</story>

    <story>Eragon for the Game Boy Advance is a traditional turn based RPG with a combat system that emphasizes motion and action. Players use combinations of spells, melee attacks, and ranged attacks to battle Urgals, thieves, soldiers, and other various enemies. This is an RPG where combat strategy plays a key role in success. Players can make use of the RPG mechanics to create offensive and defensive potions, craft better armor and weapons, learn offensive and defensive spells, or become trackers who are able to find hidden encounters. This design encourages experimentation, opens up a lot of strategic possibilities, and allows a lot of replayability. The player assumes the role of Eragon, a young boy with a mysterious origin and an important future, on his perilous journey to avenge his father, rescue the woman of his dreams and join forces with the Varden in their war against King Galbatorix. On this adventure Eragon encounters many allies; Brom the old wizened story teller, Ayra the elf guard of the dragon egg, Murtagh the orphan with a troubled past, Angela an herbalist witch, and a powerful dragon that will help unveil Eragon&apos;s true destiny.</story>

The game content is exactly the same, but it features a multiplayer mode between other systems (if they have a copy of the game and the GBA Link Cable, of course) and a brand new storyline- the player controls a F-14 pilot chosen by the US government to be assigned in the theater of operations of a war between the republics of China and Taiwan to protect America&apos;s interests in the region. The game includes, apart from the previously mentioned multiplayer mode, a landing practice mode, like Turn and Burn. It was later implemented in Majesco&apos;s two following GBA flight sims, 2004&apos;s Super Hornet F/A-18F and 2007&apos;s F24 Stealth Fighter, which re-used this game&apos;s engine, with the option of selecting between a landing carrier or a landing strip.</story>

Some of these new features including a Freestyle control, which is activated by the right thumbstick, causing you to do special moves, such as a deke, or kick the ball a fair length forwards to gain some speed. New and improved dead ball control makes corner kicks, free kicks, etc. more controllable and gives you more options. The passing game has been improved as to allow better passing by kicking directly to a teammate, passing to nowhere in particular, or open passing to allow anybody to take it.

    <story>Released only a few months after Euro 2004, FIFA 2005 brings several features to the franchise, such as the return of a player creation tool, where a player can be created from scratch from customizing the face (while it&apos;s not possible to define the texture like in previous EA Sports games such as NHL 2000, the player can customize the facial features such as shape of the eyes or the cheeks, in a way similar to RPGs such as Neverwinter Nights), accessories and playing abilities. It&apos;s also possible to create all kinds of competitions. The Career mode was also extended, allowing now up to 15 seasons, and giving the player the chance to turn the tide of a simulated match anytime. This mode is a light managerial mode, where the player not only plays, but also signs new players and increase the clubs abilities in trainers, medical staff and other club staff). The main gameplay change was the addition of First Touch controls. By performing one of the trick moves before the player gets possession of the ball it&apos;s possible to do a number of moves, such as touching the ball forward to gain a few yards ahead of the defenders or touch the ball to one side, and roll to the other of a rushing defender, and then pickup up the ball a bit ahead leaving the opponent stranded, and the inclusion of a fake shot move, which allows forwards to sit a goalkeeper before scoring in style or make defenders jump from their positions, opening room for a through pass or a run into goal. Other aspects of the game, such as the Off The Ball controls (allows the control of players that aren&apos;t in possession, moving them into an open position) remain unchanged. Another new feature is the FIFA Shop, where the player can trade points earned in many ways, from simple tasks like having a peek at the Jukebox to obtaining 10 victories in a row in Career mode, for several items, such as third jerseys, additional music, more balls and night stadiums. As it became the norm with the series, the game features 18 leagues and 38 national teams (some of these, due to licensing problems feature only generic kits and logos), summing up around 11&apos;000 real footballers.</story>

    <story>The two titles that began the Final Fantasy Adventure return in an updated and improved portable form. Both titles feature updated visuals from their original NES origins and an improved translation of the story, filling in certain plot holes previously untold in other re-releases. Both games have also been rebalanced to require less grinding, and feature gameplay fixes such as party members re-targeting a new enemy if the one they currently are targeting dies. Players are also able to save at any point outside of combat (including dungeons) and return upon loading. As with other Final Fantasy titles, players take on the role of a group of four heroes out to save the world. Using a vast collection of spells, weapons, and potions, players will travel across the kingdom fighting a range of evil characters and gaining experience to increase strength and magic abilities. Final Fantasy I allows players to build their party out of six possible classes, with varying spells and stats. Final Fantasy II brings more characterization to the party members, and builds their stats exclusively by constant use in battle. Both games get additional content in this version. Final Fantasy I features four Soul of Chaos dungeons, unlocked during the course of the plot. These elemental dungeons are for high-level players, and feature a collection of bosses taken from later Final Fantasy games. Final Fantasy II features an extra storyline known as the Soul of Rebirth. This mode is unlocked after completing the game and acts as an epilogue, featuring characters killed off in the main story. Both games gain a Bestiary that tracks all the monsters the player has fought and their stats and weaknesses.</story>

    <story>The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. However, the recent actions of the king make even the most loyal of his subordinates doubt his judgment. The captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to attack the city of Mysidia and take the Water Crystal from innocent magicians who protect it. When Cecil questions the king&apos;s orders, he is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to deliver a package to the village of Mist, accompanied by his best friend Kain, the captain of the dragoons. Little does he realize that the king&apos;s inexplicable behavior is but a part of a much larger picture, which he is yet to reveal. The fourth entry in the Final Fantasy series was released as Final Fantasy II in the West, because the second and the third games were not released there at the time. The game is a Japanese-style RPG with top-down world map navigation, automatic leveling up, and random enemy encounters. The game introduces a system called ATB (active-time battle). While combat is turn-based in its core, the game does not pause when the player accesses the battle menu. Enemies continue to act in real time regardless of the actions of the player-controlled party. The turns of the participants are calculated depending on their agility rating. Each player-controlled character has a special bar that gradually refills itself; said character may act when the bar is full. Unlike all the previous Final Fantasy games, the fourth installment does not allow the player to customize the characters&apos; abilities and classes. Each character belongs to a specific, clearly defined class- dragoon, white mage, black mage, summoner, ninja, etc. Each of these classes has distinct special abilities or magic spells. New abilities are learned automatically when a character reaches a pre-determined level. Characters join and leave the party as dictated by the game&apos;s plot events. The active party includes up to five combatants. </story>

Setting their mind to the thoughts of a magical land, they get transported to the world of Ivalice, which happens to be based on one of the friends&apos; favourite games, Final Fantasy. Finding himself alone, Marche must join a clan of warriors and travel through this new land of mystery to find his lost friends, and return to the real world, while learning all about this new place and the magic it holds. Not a direct sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics, FFTA combines the many elements of the tactical original with a slightly modern feel, and an original storyline for the GBA.

Final Fantasy V was released as a stand-alone game in Japan, and again in Final Fantasy Collection. Its U.S. debut was as part of Final Fantasy Anthology. It was also later ported to the Gameboy Advance, adding 4 new Jobs, a new 30-floor dungeon, a bestiary, a music player, the ability to quick save anywhere, a few extra pieces of equipment, and a newly update translation.</story>

    <story>A thousand years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people have is the Empire, whose leaders are looking to revive the great force once known as magic. The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as Esper, being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that initiates a dangerous series of events. The only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, who offer their very hearts and souls to save the world from the mad plans of the Empire. The sixth entry in the Final Fantasy series was dubbed Final Fantasy III in the West because three out of the five previous installments of the series had not been released there at the time. Similarly to its predecessors, this is a role-playing game where the player controls a party of characters, travelling between various locales in the world, fighting randomly appearing regular enemies and bosses, and making the characters stronger by improving their skills and getting better equipment for them. The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous installments in the series, spicing traditional turn-based combat engine with a real-time element. In battle, every character can fight using weaponry and items, and each has a special combat skill as well. It is also possible for nearly every character to learn magic spells. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, the player can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells the characters should learn. Unlike most other Japanese RPGs, the game does not have a single main character. Rather, the player-controlled party can be considered the game&apos;s collective protagonist. The first part of the game develops linearly, with one of the characters playing a central role; however, during the second part the player is associated with a different character initially, exploring the game world, recruiting characters, and completing sub-quests in a non-linear fashion.</story>

    <story>Eight hundred years ago, the sacred stones were used to defeat the Demon King. Sealing his soul inside the stones, peace was brought to the continent of Magvel and five nations were built around the power of the sacred stones. However, after 800 years of peace, the Grado Empire suddenly attacks his longtime ally Renais and a larger war threatens to break out. The player takes on the role of Prince Ephraim and his sister Princess Erika, two of the few survivors of Grado&apos;s attack, following their different paths through the story. Gameplay in Fire Emblem- The Sacred Stones is similar to its predecessors or the Advance Wars games. The player controls several different units in tactical turn-based battles. There are many different classes ranging from knights, thieves and archers to paladins, wyvern riders, great knights and more. As in RPGs, units receive experience points for their actions and may choose to upgrade to a different class once they reach a high enough level. A key element in Fire Emblem&apos;s gameplay are the three different types of weapons and magic. One type of weapon or magic is always strong against one, and weak against another type. During battles, it is also possible to visit stores to buy equipment, or houses to gain hints. Sometimes neutral units will also participate in battle. They can be convinced to join the player&apos;s army if the right person talks to them. Unlike most similar games, when a unit dies in battle it is impossible to revive it.</story>

    <story>In this second version of the Fire Pro series in the GBA over 200 wrestlers are available, with the usual CAW mode allowing to increase that number by 77. Along the Practice Dojo and the Exhibition match, the main mode is the Ironman road, where the initial roster of 10 wrestlers (11 once you finish training mode) is expanded as you beat your opponents one by one. Both Exhibition and Ironman Road feature match kinds such as Gruesome and Deathmatch (inside a electrified cage) with all assorted rule changes included. There&apos;s also the ability to play in a four-man Battle Royal. The CAW mode, one of the selling points of the original SNES titles, is as good as ever, allowing to create Wrestlers from scratch, personalizing them from how they look to how they fight, as well as trading them between federations.</story>

    <story>Fortress is a Tetris-variant puzzle game. As in that classic game, geometric pieces fall from the top of the screen and must be arranged in lines. Only instead of eliminating lines, the objective this time is to add them to the screen. The game starts with a timer (that counts a moment where neither player attack) and a castle gate falling between two flags (the opponent&apos;s flags can be seen to the left of the screen). Once placed, the remaining pieces are used to build a castle around it, as every 2x3 grid of pieces transforms into its walls. A grid of 8x3 pieces transforms into a wizard&apos;s tower that can summon a creature to attack the enemy castle. Certain special blocks add features to the building- a cannon block places a shooting cannon that starts to attack automatically the opponent&apos;s fortress. A block with a window adds one to the building. Repairing peons come out of it to help fix the damage to the castle&apos;s walls. A block with a bomb adds a cannon that fires a peon towards the opponent&apos;s castle (an aiming reticule is shown over the enemy castle to help choose the right spot). Building walls around these special blocks prevent their destruction from the enemy attack. A monster appears randomly at the bottom of the screen to attack both players. The player&apos;s goal at each level is to reach a number of score points before the opponent. The pieces can be maneuvered with the digital pad, and pressing UP on it makes them fall fast downwards. They can be rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise with the A and B buttons, respectively. Holding the R trigger allows the player to move the screen with the digital pad (for a full view of battle scene). When pressed, the L trigger destroys the top 3 rows of your castle and decreases the score. The game has three game modes- tournament, battle and blitz. They vary in the amount of seconds on the timer and the goal score. There are four themes- pre-historic, medieval, pirate and space.</story>

A level plays like a sideway scrolling platform game, though some levels will also scroll up and down to span a larger vertical area. Garfield moves from one side of the screen towards the other and must pick up food and other goodies on the way.

    <story>After having eaten very heavily just before going to bed, Garfield finds himself trapped in a nightmare from which he must escape and where he lives through all of his nine lives. The game is a conservative sidescrolling platformer, which is divided into 9 levels. Each level represents one of Garfield&apos;s lives (though this implies Garfield has lived an entire life in the sewer and another in a tree...). To get out of level, Garfield must fulfil a goal which is given at the beginning, like finding 10 eggs or getting the key to a door. After three levels, there is always a boss fight. Apart from jumping, Garfield can kick to get rid of his foes, and he can perform a ramming attack and an elbow blow.</story>

    <story>A port of the arcade game, Gauntlet- Dark Legacy is the follow-up to Gauntlet- Legends and another installment in the long-running Gauntlet series of hack-and-slash action games. As with all the Gauntlet games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal. This version contains the characters and levels from Gauntlet- Legends, plus the new characters and levels from the Dark Legacy arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in. There are eight characters to initially choose from- the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you&apos;ll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there are some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes. Unlike the early Gauntlet arcade games, the camera angle varies from location to location, from bird&apos;s eye to nearly ground level. The lands, creatures, and heroes are all rendered in 3D. While the graphics have been upgraded, the game play is very similar. You basically run around levels, hacking at what seems like unlimited armies of monsters, searching for gold, keys, and health-giving food...as well as a way out of the level. Bosses and other scripted events slow down the repetitious nature of the originals. While levels can be gained and characters saved, Gauntlet- Dark Legacy is an action game with some RPG trappings and should not be confused with the more true types from that genre.</story>

The main hero is Tetsuo from the previous game - he returned to his sensei&apos;s house and now must liberate the village from demons. Game isn&apos;t a standard beat&apos;em up - has nonlinear levels, not just go-right. Often Tetsuo must first find key to doors, or talk to the right people. Rest is simple - he fights against various demons, he can kick, punch and use special magic. Sometimes Tetsuo jumps on narrow platforms. Game has 2D graphic and anime-style cut scenes.</story>

    <story>Gem Smashers is an action puzzle game where the player has to rescue prehistoric creatures captured by a fearsome scientist from outer space. Three creatures, Bau, Bam and Bom have already escaped and the player takes control of these. The game consists of single screen levels that are full of gems in different colours. It&apos;s the player&apos;s task to destroy these with the use of the little creature that bounces around the screen. The problem is that the creature can only destroy gems of the same colour as itself and therefore it&apos;s necessary to hit specific colour changing blocks that may be hidden in a rock that first has to be broken. To make it all a bit trickier there are also death blocks marked by skulls that the player has to avoid hitting. Once all gems have been destroyed an exit opens and the player can move on to the next level. The game has a story mode with more than 100 levels, an arcade mode with more than 60 levels and a battle mode for two players via link cable. There are also three special modes that the player can unlock. The story mode consists of a world map where for each section the player can complete the levels in any order. Each section ends with a boss fight. Depending on which of the creatures the player chooses to play as he will start at different sections. The arcade mode has a more linear level structure. </story>

Mages from the rival island of Gondowan plan to destroy Angara by using four Elemental Stones, so Isaac has assembled a team to snatch the stones. In the universe of this role-playing game, four different types of elements (fire, water, wind and earth) are combined to create spells. Combat often involves facing multiple monsters at each time. Djinni creatures can be captured and used to give one of your characters extra strengths. Energy is needed to cast spells, but this constantly replenishes while you are not using one.

Players can capture Mogwais and turn them into Gremlins by hitting them with a cream pie. Stripe can also attack by using his claws. Gremlins- Stripe Vs.

    <story>When the humans created artificial beings named gears in 22th century, they didn&apos;t expect that their creation will eventually turn against them. Because gears had no will of their own and could only obey humans. Only one gear, named Justice, was able to transfer his will onto other gears and to rebel against the humans. In year 2180, Justice was killed as a result of a bloody tournament organized by the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. Yet recently, a new gear was discovered. He showed no signs of hostility, yet he had no master and was roaming about free. It was impossible to capture or to kill him because he was immensely strong. Fearing a new Justice will grow out of this gear, the Order organized yet another tournament, this time with a solid prize- five hundred thousand world dollars for the winner. Guilty Gear X is a follow up to Guilty Gear, and is also a 2D fighting game. There are now 16 characters available for you to choose. The battle system became more complicated, thanks to the variety of moves you can perform. Beside special attacks which you can execute if you build up your Tension Gauge by attacking or advancing towards your opponent, there is also a variety of defensing moves to perform. The instant kill moves are back from the previous game.</story>

    <story>Hamtaro and his friends are back for another installment of the ever-so-popular Hamtaro craze. This time, Spat threatens to cause trouble for our protagonists, and it&apos;s up to Hamtaro to stop him before it&apos;s too late! Is a potential heartbreak for Hamtaro and Bijou imminent?!? This version plays much like the first installment, a psuedo action/adventure/graphic-and-text adventure. Again, with 86 Ham-chat words to collect, some old faves such as the greeting Hamha! and some new ones like GoGo (Go). Hamtaro- Ham Ham Heartbreak is based on the anime Tottoko Hamtaro, original concept by Ritsuko Kawai.</story>

All the regular moves are present- player switches, a tip off, passing, 1-2 passing, shooting, targetting, steals and dunks with hoop hanging. While playing, a stamina bar is shown. A temporary boost can be activated, but the amount will slowly decrease during the match and eventually substitutions may be needed. Another feature is the special bar, fed by impressive dunks and passes. When maxed out, players are able to perform special dunks. Progressing through the World Tour unlocks new teams.

    <story>The game for Game Boy Advance based on the second Harry Potter book and movie is, like its predecessor, an action adventure, this time with an isometric perspective. In Harry&apos;s second year at Hogwarts, bad things are happening. The ancient Chamber of Secrets has been opened, and what lurks within is attacking students. To get through this ordeal alive (and advance the plot) Harry must again complete various challenges. These mostly consist of navigating large mazes - fighting monsters, solving puzzles, flipping switches and pressing buttons for doors to open. Six spells are available to help. As Harry is often in places he shouldn&apos;t be, stealth sequences are also a large part of the game. To avoid teachers and prefects, he can sneak around slowly and hide behind curtains. If he is caught, he is thrown out (to try again) and house points can be deducted. As in other Potter games, there are a lot of collectibles, found both in plain view and in hidden areas. Sets of Famous Wizard cards unlock bonuses, Every Flavour Beans get Harry passwords that let him move through shortcuts in the school and Chocolate Frogs increase his maximum stamina. Finally, Quidditch is also back in this game, this time in three-dimensional space, viewed from the back.</story>

This year, the Triwizard Tournament takes place, and Harry is mysteriously entered into the tournament himself. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire for the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance is a top-down action/adventure game where you play as the three friends and progress through the story based on the book and film. Make your way through various scenarios by attacking enemies and solving puzzles using spells. One button fires a ranged spell, such as Confoundus, while another is used for stream spells, like Wingardium Leviosa, which can be moved around with the Control Pad. You can also call your friends for added power to your magical spells. The DS version includes a small bonus game where you take care of a magical creature called a &apos;Niffler&apos;. It is a simulation game, like a very simple Tamagotchi. You can feed the Niffler, clean it, and give it toys - depending on what you do, it will become more or less pleased with you. Perform well enough, and it will become really happy, and let you pat it to make it even happier.</story>

If Harry is hurt, he can find and eat Bertie Bott&apos;s Every Flavor Beans to regain health. By performing admirably in learning spells and completing missions, Harry can gain extra House Points so that Gryffindor might win the House Cup. If he misbehaves by attacking other students, or being caught wandering the halls at night, points will be deducted, however. As seeker for the Gryffindor team, Harry must also compete in Quidditch matches. The game has a special mode for Quidditch and other events where Harry might have to mount his broom.</story>

    <story>In Hello Kitty- Happy Party Pals Hello Kitty needs help to organize parties. The game consists of different levels (parties) that need to be planned. This includes inviting guests, gathering supplies and keeping everyone happy. The guests&apos; happiness is shown through a percentage by talking to them, but it is also visible through a meter above their heads. If a certain rating is achieved Hello Kitty can move on to the next level. The game contains many Sanrio characters and it is the first Hello Kitty game for the GBA. The first party is a small one in Kitty&apos;s playroom and she needs to invite two family members. Kitty can freely move around in the house to collect supplies such as a table cloth, a music disc, balloons etc. The gathered supplies are stored in a journal. The journal also shows who to invite. Kitty needs to do this by walking up to them and initiating a conversation. The guests are not always the same and items are not always in the same location. When talking to a potential guest their happiness rating is shown. By talking to them or giving items that rating can be improved, but only up to a certain level. The final part of the planning is decorating the room, with, for instance, the cloth and the balloons. Once the party starts Kitty can talk to the characters or play music to improve their happiness rating. The music needs to be matched with the guests. Old tunes will only make the elder people happy, but young people can for instance be given cake instead or you can play a game with them. Many parts of the planning involve mini-games. Kitty can for instance make cakes. She needs to pour dough on a cooker with six burners, quickly flip them to prevent them from burning and then transfer them to a plate with a time limit of one minute. The second party takes place in the garden and Kitty can play the Bouncing Balloons mini-game in the sandbox, a Bust-A-Move clone. Based on the player&apos;s score various types of food are provided for the party. With each new party new environments are introduced, such as a garden, a park, an arcade etc. with more guests and items. The third party is a park picnic. It has a mini-game that is a Concentration variant, matching identical cards. Guests can also be made happy by playing the Cutie Catch game. It is based on throwing a ball by determining the angle and the power of the throw so the other character can catch it and vice versa. The fourth party takes place at a Sushi restaurant and the fifth one at the Arcade. Other mini-games are a Dance Dance Revolution-like rhythm game, a sliding puzzle game, and designing custom invitations in a simplified art program, using images and colours that match the recipient&apos;s taste. Many items and activities return for the different parties. After each completed level a password is provided and it possible to access the thirteen mini-games right away from the main menu.</story>

All they want to do is take a breather, but Harmony, the girls&apos; number one fan, won&apos;t let them. When Ami and Yumi refuse to cater to Harmony&apos;s whim, the crazed blonde takes matters into her own hands - by stealing their diminutive manager Kaz and their instruments! Now Ami and Yumi must use their wits - and what&apos;s left of their music - to recover their instruments, find Harmony and rescue Kaz. Without any of them, Puffy AmiYumi may be doomed! Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi- Kaznapped is a single-player platformer based on the Cartoon Network series Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi. Controlling and using Ami and Yumi&apos;s unique abilities (Ami can sing and swing, while Yumi plays guitar and lifts heavy objects), the player battles through six worlds of three areas each (with another world revealed when the game is complete). Along their way Ami and Yumi will encounter a series of puzzles which only a certain skill can solve, Kaz-bots created by Harmony, and other Puffy fans who just want a piece of the girls. Kaz-bots can be attacked, but fans can only be temporarily distracted (if they get attacked, the girls will lose points). Thankfully, Ami and Yumi can gain an advantage by petting their cats Jang Keng (to regain lost health) or Tekirai (for an extra life). As Ami and Yumi progress in their adventure, they can also unlock mini-games, costumes, and other goodies for the player to enjoy.</story>

    <story>Hot Wheels- All Out is a handheld racing game based on the car toys with the same name. The game is played from an isometric perspective and lets the player race around with 19 different classic Hot Wheels cars including Phantasm, Bullygoat and Firestorm. The action takes place on four tracks each with its own theme. These are city, ice, volcano and jungle. Each track has its own obstacles that the player has to watch out for. In the city there is manholes and old ladies, while on the ice track the player has to avoid snowmen and polar bears. In addition to just racing around, the player can also use Nitro and slow motion features. Four game modes are available- The quick play mode brings the player straight into the action. The player chooses location car and mode and then then the track is randomly selected. Second, challenges come in five different variants- In VS the player competes against AI controlled cars and has to come first. In Collector the player has to collect items before time runs out. In Pursuit the player has to catch up with a criminal car before time runs out. In Eliminator the last placed player gets eliminated. In Beat the Clock the player races against the clock. The third game mode is the ultimate challenge where the player can win the All Out trophy. Here the player will have to complete multiple challenges in turn to unlock the next one.</story>

    <story>Hot Wheels- Burnin&apos; Rubber is a racing game licensed from the line of toy cars. It features 25 cars that can be taken for races on 16 different tracks. The game&apos;s main Grand Prix mode is organized into four increasingly difficult cups that have to be taken on in order, each consisting of two sets of four races. Finishing in first or second place in a race is necessary to advance - finishing further behind costs a life. Races are displayed in a Mode-7-style sprite scaling and rotation engine, with cars displayed as rendered bitmaps. Many of the courses take the miniature car concept literally and take place in large everyday locations like a bathroom, a piano or a billiard table. Winning races earns money that can be spent to tune cars by purchasing new engines, mufflers, computers and other components, increasing top speed, acceleration or traction. Only five cars are available for selection from the start, the others have to be unlocked through winning in Grand Prix mode or beating time records. Progress in Grand Prix mode is stored to battery-backed RAM. Further game modes include single races and time trials on courses unlocked in Grand Prix mode. There is also a two-player mode via link cable, requiring both players to have their own cartridge.</story>

Players play as all three animal friends, and can switch between them at will to use their distinct abilities to solve each level&apos;s terrain hazards. Manny the mammoth can use his great strength to push large boulders, or swim through deep lakes; Diego the sabertooth tiger can swipe his way through thorny bushes and leap chasms; Sid the sloth can melt ice blocks, climb walls, and cross cracking iceflows. Breaking up the puzzle-solving action are several Scrat levels, where players control the hyper rodent through insanely-fast sidescroller levels where he leaps, tunnels, and flies through the scenery to collect his precious acorns. There are over 30 adventure levels, boss levels, and a half-dozen Scrat levels.</story>

    <story>In the game based on the movie of the same name, you take control of Mr. Incredible when he is summoned to the island of Nomanisan for a secret assignment. The GBA version is a side-scrolling 2D beat-em-up. Initially, you can only play as Mr. Incredible but the other members of the family, along with Frozone, are playable in the later levels. The main buttons are used for basic attacks, combos and jumps, and the R button triggers special abilities known as incredi-moves. Each member has a different special move- Mr. Incredible gets super strength, Dash runs faster, Violet has a force field and becomes invisible, and Helen can extend her arms. Using these depletes an additional meter on the screen. It is recharged by collecting icons and defeating enemies. Next to the icons used for incredi-moves, you can also collect band-aid to restore your health, extra lives, and frozone bottles. There are more than 30 levels, with a few chase sequences (playing as Dash), and familiar characters such as Syndrome, E and Bomb Voyage make an appearance. Both the enemies, carrying a variety of weapons, and the levels have a distinct hand-drawn, comic-book look, rather than mimicking the 3D visuals from the film. After completing a level, you receive a password to continue the next time.</story>

Each of the moves scores a different number of points and if you come last in a particular round you are eliminated. There are some sub-games too, involving your karate-master holding a shield and defending himself against bouncing balls from both directions, and kicking bombs off the screen before they explode. All in the pursuit of that elusive black belt...</story>

    <story>Trouble at Stark Enterprises- Tony Stark aka Iron Man finds that one of his Iron Man suits has been stolen. Given enough time, the thief might be able to reverse engineer the technology and use it to find weaknesses to exploit or, even worse, duplicate it and use it for sinister purposes. Thankfully, each suit is outfitted with a locator beacon. Tony slips into one of his remaining suits and sets out to get the stolen suit back and find out who is behind the theft. Iron Man&apos;s quest will take him through a number of large levels in a side-scrolling platformer. His primary weapon against the many enemies awaiting him is the repulsor blast fired from the gauntlets of the suit. Another attack is a quick shoulder tackle. The boot jets of the suit allow Iron Man to get to places not reachable with a normal jump. Firing the repulsor blast depletes the energy supply of the suit. The supply slowly recharges on its own, but a quicker way to regain spent energy is finding energy powerups. Other powerups include health boosts and some special weapons. At the end of some levels, boss battles await. Between the levels, comic-style cutscenes continue the storyline.</story>

    <story>Tokyo-to, a city not unlike Tokyo, somewhere in Asia, in the near future. This is the story about the GG&apos;s, one of three rival teenage gangs who ride motorised inline skates and are tagging the streets with graffiti. There is a turf war going on between the gangs GG&apos;s, the Poison Jam, and the high-tech freaks, the Noise Tanks. The evil Rokkaku Corporation has the corrupt police in their grasp, and, headed by Captain Onishima, the cops are hell-bent on subduing the unruly teen protagonists. But there is light in the darkness- the underground DJ, Professor K, and his Jet Set Radio station keep tabs on what is happening on the streets of Tokyo-to, and soon our teens will have something much darker than the police to worry about. As one of the GG&apos;s, you skate through a variety of different levels, from busy streets to run-down rooftops and smelly sewers where you learn new moves, collect spray cans, and tag the streets with graffiti. New graffiti designs can be unlocked by finding Graffiti Souls in levels, by designing new graffiti yourself, or by going online and downloading any images you find while browsing the internet. Fight the rival gangs Poison Jam and the Noise Tanks, the evil mega-corporation Rokkaku and their police cronies in this fresh take on the platform genre, mixing traditional platform elements with skating similar to that of the Tony Hawk&apos;s Pro Skater games. Players are scored on their performance in a level, both on the level of graffiti attempted as well as optional tags and skating tricks. As the game progresses challenge maps open that test the player&apos;s ability to do larger tags, more tricks, or race against an opponent. The American and European release contained two new levels based on New York. The story and order that you meet characters was modified to include these two levels. Both releases also have different unique soundtracks for these levels.</story>

The Ancients disappeared, leaving only their devices for future civilizations to discover. Years later, the Settlers arrived and built their cities in the lands where the machinery was left, and all was prosperous. However, nothing remains perfect forever. Powerful alchemists tried to harness the power of the Ancients&apos; machines in their lust for power, and war broke out. Those that tried to use the Ancients&apos; machines, or The Dark Alchemists, as they became known, were killed or exiled, and peace eventually returned. Rumour has it though, that the last of the Dark Alchemists, the Monophonic Menace, has returned to conquer the world. Juka and the Monophonic Menace is an action-adventure game. The title character, Juka, is an alchemist who can collect ingredients from trees, water, bushes, and other places to mix and create potions. Potions can be used as a form of defense against enemies, can alter the landscape, or even activate machines. Juka also has a Sound Staff, which can be used to absorb and fire back different types of sounds at certain enemies.</story>

To his help, the player has a temporary turbo which he can refill by driving over special items that he finds on the race tracks. Weapons exist too; rockets and mines can be used by the player to stop the competition from winning. The game&apos;s career mode allows the player to compete and progress in four different race series. Each of these has unique vehicles and courses. While racing the player can earn money which can be used to upgrade the car&apos;s tires and engine as well as buy more armor, rockets and mines. There&apos;s also a gambling option. The player can bet by guessing on different outcomes from the races, such as the right finishing order. The game also has a multiplayer mode for up to four players.</story>

Career Mode - Select a surfer and journey around the world to surf the best waves on the best beaches. As you progress you will unlock new beaches, new surf boards, and new tricks which will be usable in all the other modes of play. Multiplayer Modes- Push - Two players surf simultaneously in an attempt to push the split screen towards their opponent&apos;s half of the screen. As you score points the screen gets pushed more. The winner is decided once one player is pushed from the screen.

Together the pair work as a team to take on Monkey Fist, Senior Senior Sr. and Jr., and of course, the ever-incompetent Dr. Drakken, as they try to work out who stole Kim&apos;s grandmother&apos;s photo album. Players must use both Kim and Ron effectively as they make their way through the many large levels of Team Possible. Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses- Ron does not have much attack power, but he makes up for this later by getting better gadgets than Kim. Kim, on the other hand, can defeat enemies without much difficulty, but cannot access particular areas without Ron&apos;s help. The game is also unique in that two players can link up and play the game co-operatively, with one playing as Kim, and the other as Ron. This also makes certain sections, such as the rocket skate racing levels, more competitive.</story>

    <story>Two years have now passed since the last edition of King of Fighters Tournament, accomplished in 1997- after Orochi was sealed by the joint forces of Kyo Kusanagi, Chizuru Kagura and Iori Yagami, all the fighters returned to their normal lives. But suddenly, a mysterious host decided to reopen the tournament and have been sent serial invitations to the most powerful fighters. But there are many secrets surrounding this happy-hour fighting clash, as the apparent disappearance of Iori Yagami and a remote distrust behind this unknown sponsor- that he would be using the championship to accomplish secret operations involving (maybe) the Orochi power... This title marks the first installment of King of Fighters Series on Nintendo&apos;s 32-bit handheld. It brings a lot of gameplay characteristics based in both KOF Evolution (most of the graphic stuff and principally both Striker System and backgrounds, now represented by a static 2D frame instead of the original 3D ones) and KOF 2000 (the musical repertoire). Besides the traditional game modes (Team Play, Team Battle, Single Play, Single Battle, Endless Survival and Survival Time Attack), this game marks too the debut of a new-exclusive female character named Moe Habana. With the permanence of 3 on 3 combats (plus Striker Attacks) and the introduction of a new female fighter, the main cast is composed by- 1. Hero Team- Kyo Kusanagi, Benimaru Nikaido, Moe Habana and Shingo Yabuki 2. Fatal Fury Team- Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, Mai Shiranui and Joe Higashi 3. Art of Fighting Team- Ryo Sakazaki, Robert Garcia, King and Yuri Sakazaki 4. Ikari Team- Leona Heidern, Ralf Jones, Clark Steel and Whip 5. Psycho Soldier Team- Athena Asamiya, Sie Kensou, Bao and Chin Gentsai 6. Korea Team- Kim Kaphwan, Chang Koehan, Choi Bounge and Jhun Hoon</story>

With the championship invitations in hand, the fighters (some of them) decided to participate not just to compare their strength, but also to investigate rumors that Gustav is involved with serial kidnappings involving children and also his involvement with a secret operation related to the Orochi Power. Being the second installment of the KOF Series on Nintendo&apos;s 32-bit handheld, this title brings a lot of gameplay characteristics and elements taken from its arcade/console counter-part The King of Fighters 2000 like the backgrounds and a good part of its musical repertoire. However, a set of additional stuff was included, like the appearance of 3 all-new exclusive characters (the male Reiji Okami and the females Miu Kurosaki and Jun Kagami), 2 new backgrounds, a modified Striker System (where the 2nd and 3rd players of a team will assume progressively this function) and a Ranking Mode, where you&apos;ll be rated according to your fighting performance (beginning from Newcomer until Master Orochi). With the return of 3 on 3 matches and the introduction of new fighters, the main cast is formed by- 1. Hero Team- Kyo Kusanagi, Moe Habana and Reiji Okami 2. Fatal Fury Team- Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard and Mai Shiranui 3. Ikari Team- Leona Heidern, Ralf Jones and Clark Steel 4. Korea Team- Kim Kaphwan, Choi Bounge and Chang Koehan 5.

Most of the game is very slow paced, so that players can take their time and carefully think about their next move. You still use the same mechanic of inflating your enemies and using them to either double jump or throw them at other enemies, but the action now takes place on a fixed 2D area. Players can also aim to collect all the Dream Stones within the levels, which will unlock secret bonuses.

    <story>The GBA version of Lara Croft Tomb Raider- Legend is a side-scrolling platform game more similar to the DS version instead of the 3D console versions by a different development studio. Unlike the previous GBA game in the series, a side view is used instead of more titled, overhead camera perspective. The plot is the same as the console versions. In a search for the relic Lara Croft travels through Japan, Bolivia, England, Kazakhstan, Ghana and the Himalayas. She get some new tools in this game to help her during the search for the relic. The PDA for instance, provides real-time statistics and updates on objectives. The grapple hook can be used to swing over pits and also captures enemies. A headset is used to keep contact with Zip who follows Lara through the cam and informs her about new objectives when they become available. Lara can also jump, attack with her guns, and she needs to swing to new platforms, avoid obstacles and take out enemies and animals in her way. Timing and precision is essential to reach platforms, much like the early Prince of Persia games. New guns are collected when enemies drop them, but this does not change the sprite of the weapon Lara is holding. There are also a number of vehicle sequences where Lara is driving a bike. The cut-scenes that progress the story are shown as pages from a comic book, with bubble dialogue. After collecting treasure, it can be exchanged in the main menu to unlock a number of mini-games, cinematics, character profiles, cheat codes and a time trial mode to complete levels as fast as possible.</story>

Along the way she&apos;ll meet enemies both human and otherwise and will also have to deal with dark magic of sorts. Lara is now in a quasi-3D isometric/top-down environment, as opposed to the 2D-platformer view of the previous handheld (GBC) versions. This view proves helpful while Lara runs, jumps, shimmys, shoots around.

    <story>When the Dark Master attacked the sacred temple, the Fire Guardian, Ignitus, could only manage to save one of the dragon eggs from being destroyed. This egg found its way to a family of dragonflies, who raised the newly hatched dragon as one of their own, along with their son Sparx. The dragon, Spyro, soon discovered his heritage, and with Sparx, began on a quest to discover himself and eventually, save the world from the Dark Master&apos;s forces. The Legend of Spyro- A New Beginning is a side-scrolling platformer based on the console game of the same name. As Spyro, players can attack with melee attacks and charge tackles. In addition to this, breath attacks are unlocked as players progress through the game, allowing Spyro to control the elements of fire, ice, earth and lightning. The R Button will let Spyro fire a stream of breath, while the L Button will hurl a ranged attack at foes. Finally, players can press L and R together when their purple Fury Meter is full to unleash a more powerful attack. A New Beginning also features mini-games such as a whack-a-mole style game, flying levels which play somewhat like a shooter in the vein of games like 1942. You&apos;ll even come across boss battles as you attempt to free the other Guardians from the evil dragon Cynder&apos;s forces.</story>

    <story>Recently, famine and drought have plagued Hyrule. When all seemed lost, a mysterious wizard, Agahnim, appeared, and stopped these strange happenings from occurring. But there is talk that Agahnim now rules the country with his magic, behind the scenes. And then, one night, the Princess of Hyrule, Zelda, calls out for help...and the one who hears her pleas is a young lad named Link... The Legend of Zelda- A Link to the Past is a top-down action adventure game (similar to the original Legend of Zelda) for the Super Nintendo and Game Boy Advance. Players assume the role of Link, and their goal is to rescue Princess Zelda and save the land of Hyrule. Unlike turn-based RPGs, all combat in Link to the Past is in real-time - you swing your sword at enemies by pressing a button, or can spin the sword around you for a more powerful attack by holding down the button until it is charged. Progression through the game is done by conquering a series of dungeons - each dungeon has its own special item associated with it, such as the hookshot (which latches onto a far-off object and pulls Link across) or the hammer (which can be used to flatten objects in your way). Most of these dungeons are rendered impassable until the dungeon&apos;s particular item is acquired; from there, the rest of the dungeon becomes accessible due to Link&apos;s latest new ability. The bosses of each dungeon are also themed to that level&apos;s particular item. Link starts out with only three units of health; however, these can be increased by defeating dungeon bosses, which give one additional heart container, or by finding four &apos;pieces of heart&apos;; which can be given for anything from passing a small trial to winning a mini-game. Some of Link&apos;s items also use magic - this can be refilled with collectible green magic pots. After defeating the initial three dungeons, Link gains access to the Dark World - many puzzles and difficulties come from alternating between the Light World (Hyrule) and the Dark World to make your way past previously impassable obstacles. The Game Boy Advance version of the game also includes a special extra dungeon. In addition to this, there is the first multiplayer Zelda game ever- Four Swords. In this game puzzles are based around co-operation with other players - for example, picking up an enemy and throwing it at another player which allows its weak point to be hit, or a boss which only shows the weak point you can hit on an opponent&apos;s screen. However, the game also contains an element of competitiveness - whoever gains the most rupees at the end of the level wins a bonus medal. Collect enough of these and you can unlock a special quest in A Link to the Past.</story>

    <story>While at a festival with Princess Zelda, Link encounters a mysterious mage, called Vaati, who turns the princess to stone. Helpless to stop them, Link is asked by the king to meet with a race of tiny people known as the Minish, who may be able to help with their predicament. On his travels, Link teams up with a talking cap called Ezlo, who is able to shrink Link to the size of a Minish so that he can meet with them. With his newfound abilities, Link must save the kingdom from Vaati&apos;s menace. The Legend of Zelda- The Minish Cap is a top-down action adventure game that tells the origins of the evil Vaati from Four Swords. Players take on the role of Link as they conquer various dungeons to retrieve essential tools to fight enemies and progress through various obstacles. Items such as the Mole Mitts allow Link to dig through dirt, while the Gust Jar can be used to suck in enemies, items, and propel Link. Link can also shrink down to the size of a Minish with the aid of Ezlo, the talking cap. The Minish Cap uses the gameplay mechanic of shrinking to make familiar territory new and different. Puddles become huge rivers, baby chicks are huge monsters, and regular enemies become deadly bosses at Minish size. Link can also trade items called Kinstones with people in the game - when two pieces of the same Kinstone are joined together, new areas open up, treasure chests appear, and sometimes, even useful rewards are given to Link.</story>

    <story>Focused on the original trilogy of the Star Wars universe (A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and The Return of Jedi), the sequel to LEGO Star Wars brings some innovations over the first title. During the story mode, the player is joined on-screen by two other characters, and can change between them to use their specific skills to proceed. Characters share a life bar of four hearts, with the rate of depletion changing according to each character (a stormtrooper will lose three hearts when hit by a blaster, Vader will take two or three hits before losing one). If a support character is dismantled by attacks, there&apos;s no problem, but letting that happen to the controlled character means a loss of stud points (the game currency), as well as a drop on the Super Kit gauge, which replaces the Jedi rank evaluation of the previous titles. Gameplay has been changed to accommodate the lack of lightsaber battles in the later episodes, and so blasters are a lot more effective and fire faster, but have lost their charge mode. New flight missions are also included. These are similar to previous Star Wars games, like Return of the Jedi, and allow the player to attack both Death Stars, skim the surface of the forest moon of Endor in a Speeder, escape from an asteroid field with the Millennium Falcon, or draw wires around the legs of Imperial walkers in Hoth. There are three major character classes- droids (unable to fight, but the only ones capable of opening most regular doors during story mode), Jedi (melee fighters capable of interacting with larger objects to uncover hidden studs and with different Jedi powers) and Blaster users, which can fire at an enemy from a distance, as well as assemble smaller objects (like short bridges or door switches). Gameplay remains a light jump-and-slash isometric game, with the goal being usually to go from point A to B, while pulling levers somewhere in the level. Like in the first game, the game can not be entirely completed without playing in Free Mode (a near perfect run in Story mode will only complete around 50% of the game), as many doors can only be opened, or even reached, by using the unique special abilities of one of the 36 unlockable characters. To acquire characters for Free Play, the player now needs to accomplish three things- earn enough credits (the value of each stud was increased 10 fold), complete a level (to unlock playable characters such as the level variation of Luke or Leia), and get all mini kits (which replace the Death Star Plans of the prequel). Characters that can be unlocked include enemies, such as the Tusken Raider or Stormtroopers, or heroic characters, like Yoda. There are also additional items to be bought, including music, palette swaps, new game modes, lightsaber colours and hints.</story>

    <story>Based on the movie (and first three books of the series), Lemony Snicket&apos;s a Series of Unfortunate Events for Game Boy Advance puts players in the unfortunate shoes of the incredibly unlucky Baudelaire orphans- Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. Each orphan has an unusual talent that will let them progress through three chapters (each with over a dozen levels). Though the game looks like a traditional side-scroller, combat takes a backseat to clever puzzle-solving and adventure game elements. The three orphans must use their talents, along with items found in the world, and various interactions to escape each level and avoid the evil Count Olaf and his elaborate plans to inherit the children&apos;s fortune. Inventions also take a big role in this game, and players will have to assemble them from common household objects. For example, in one level, Violet will be hunting for ice cream scoopers, soup cans, and a crank to invent an apple chucker which can help defeat Count Olaf&apos;s friends. The game offers quite a bit of replayability, too, with quest points and exotic books earned for discovering all the game&apos;s quirky secrets.</story>

    <story>Set after the events of the 2002 movie, Disney&apos;s Lilo &amp; Stitch lets players take control of the two lead characters in a variety of action adventure, shooter, and puzzle style levels. Hawaiian life is going well for the newly Earth-adjusted Stitch until a group of aliens, led by Dr. Pestus, kidnap Lilo and take her to their home planet. Stitch resolves to save her, and gameplay shifts between the events of both Lilo and Stitch throughout eight levels. Stitch&apos;s levels are all shooter intensive, similar to games like Metal Slug for the side-scrolling levels, and Gyruss for the shooter levels. In the side scrolling levels, Stitch blasts everything in his path with his laser pistols and pineapple bombs, until he is eventually able to find a spaceship and continuing his rescue mission to the Junkyard Planet. Lilo&apos;s levels are set in an Out of the World or Flashback style, where Lilo must use stealth, solve puzzles, and use Scrump, her doll, to evade and confuse her alien captors. Once Lilo and Stitch find each other, they must escape via an alien tank to stop Dr. Pestus and escape back to Earth. Along the way, players can collect stills and small video clips featuring scenes from the movie. The game uses a password save to continue where players left off.</story>

    <story>The Lord of the Rings- The Third Age for the Game Boy Advance encompasses the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy, but does so in a unique turn-based strategy formula. Unlike the console versions, the Game Boy Advance version gives players the option of playing the heroes from the trilogy, selecting their commander from the likes of Aragorn and Gandalf, or even using the evil forces of Mordor and choosing the Witch-king or Saruman. From there, the player experiences over 30 battle scenarios, ranging from the well-known battles of the film (Helm&apos;s Deep and the Pelennor Fields), small skirmishes (Amon Hen and Osgiliath), and even some more battles just hinted at in the movies (Isildur&apos;s ambush, Theodred&apos;s death at the fords of the River Isen). In each battle, players choose their companions (again, classic characters from the films such as Legolas and Gimli are available, along with bad guys like Wormtongue and Gorbag), and face off against the foe with dozens of troops, including orcs, trolls, Gondorians, Riders of Rohan, Easterlings, Mumakil, and dozens more. Unlike other turn-based games, you can&apos;t move all of your units each turn. Rather, the board is divided into three flanks, and your hero in each flank generates the command points you use to move units in that flank. Thus, good leaders like Aragorn may have a lot of command points to give his flank (3-4 is typical), while Gimli may have less, but be a better warrior to make up for it. After a battle, you can upgrade your heroes with equipment and special skills, and move onward to conquer the next area of Middle-earth.</story>

The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more. The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles. The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.</story>

    <story>The events of this game take place twenty-five years before those depicted in Fortress of Doom. You control a young man named Eldin. His father was a great treasure hunter who once ventured into ancient ruins and never came back. Eldin became a hunter himself, and is looking for an adventure together with his friends Torma and Rami. Before soon the youngsters come into conflict with the evil kingdom of Gratze, and realize they have to do anything to stop their plans of resurrecting an ancient beast. This is a traditional Japanese RPG with turn-based combat viewed from top-down perspective. Enemy encounters are not random, and the enemies are visible on screen. You can gain advantage in battles if you initiate combat by approaching the enemy. The characters can master a variety of jobs, learning abilities and switching classes, or combining them the way the player likes. You can also use special items in battle to capture monsters and to make them fight on you side. You can also upgrade those monsters and even merge with them to become more powerful.</story>

    <story>M&amp;M&apos;s Blast! is a Mario Party-style party game licensed from the candy brand. Players move their M&amp;M candy characters (red, yellow, blue, or green) across a game board by rolling dice and deciding which way to go at a crossroads. The goal is to collect the highest number of M&amp;M&apos;s minis. Green spaces add minis, red spaces remove them. Yellow spaces allow players to swap places with another player. Gold spaces do nothing, while blue spaces launch one of sixteen mini-games in which players compete for M&amp;M&apos;s. These include catching falling candies, playing mini-golf, basketball or dodgeball, or a top-down race through a labyrinth to get to the sweets. Other game board spaces include teleporters and random events (wheel-of-fortune style). Up to four players can play the game. On a single GBA, CPU players can join in, while multiplayer requires several GBAs connected via link cable. Four different game boards are available that can be played either in single games or in a tournament. A game in progress is stored to battery-backed RAM to be resumed later. The mini-games can also be played directly from the menu.</story>

    <story>Mr. Runch is a rotten and dangerous peanut that has escaped the reject bin. Burning with revenge and sworn to become a real M&amp;M peanut, he is now on the loose and plans to kidnap all M&amp;M&apos;s to lock them up in a crystal. Five M&amp;M heroes - Red, Yellow, Blue, Green and Orange - need to stop him. M&amp;M&apos;s Break&apos; Em is mainly a reworking of Gem Smashers, an earlier game by Frame Studios Interactive. The main story mode takes place on different locations, gradually unlocked, along with boss battles. Keys can also unlock hidden levels, marked by a pink spot on the map. The player controls one of the M&amp;M&apos;s and bounces it throughout the screen. They have different characteristics such based on speed, power and boost. It needs to hit crystals of the same colour (pinballing vertically off objects) and special pots are used to change the colour. When all crystals are gone, the level is completed. Gameplay is time limited, crossing it makes a bouncing skull appear on the screen taking away lives. Special blocks contain bonuses such as detonators, extra points, invulnerability, score multipliers and a harder M&amp;M that cuts through all crystals. The M&amp;M can be moved left or right horizontally, and sped up or slowed down. Skills slightly influence gameplay. High power requires less hits to break hard rocks, while boost allows the character to speed up. Only Yellow and Green can break special blocks to access bonuses. The DS version can be controlled with the stylus and contains a multiplayer mode.</story>

Upon opening it, hand appears and kidnaps the boys into Storybook Land. Now Donald Duck and his pal Mickey Mouse must go save the boys by defeating the evil King Pete! This game is for one to two players. You can choose to play as either Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck. Options also include difficulty settings. The gameplay starts off much the way previous Magical Quest games have in that you jump on your enemies, spin them around, collect coins, etc. Later both Mickey and Donald will be given costumes that will give them special abilities. You will first receive a set of armor. While Mickey receive a full knight&apos;s armor which includes a lance with a giant boxing glove at the end and a shield. Donald, however, gets a barrel and a hammer because his butt&apos;s too big for the armor. Both costumes has its pros and cons - for example, Donald&apos;s weapon can only be aimed forward while Mickey&apos;s can be aimed up/down/forward. But, in water Mickey&apos;s armor will drag him down and sink while Donald&apos;s can float. If playing with two players, these attributes can be used together so, for example, Mickey can take a ride on Donald&apos;s back across the water. In each stage, there are various hidden doors which will give you access to Bonus Games, shops and areas with coins and treasures. In a Bonus Game, you will pick one of our three cards and unless you get the card with King Pete&apos;s picture, you will receive some sort of prize. In the shops, you can purchase upgrades for your costumes, lives and hearts for your health meter.</story>

    <story>Based on the documentary March of the Penguins, this game follows the story of the emperor penguins as they embark on a long journey to breed their young. The game has been divided into twelve chapters, with different gameplay. The penguins need to be navigated through the environment, find a suitable mate, find food, take care of the egg, guard the young ones and finally make it all the way back. A large part of the game is based on the concept of Lemmings. As the penguins march on, players need to help them land softly, melt obstacles, attract them in a certain direction using fish and place trampolines, ramps, slides, bridges and steps to make them access new areas. The levels can be explored using binoculars and the penguins need to collect a certain amount of snowflakes to pass. The penguins cannot die. When they fall off a cliff, they simply restart at the beginning of the level, but the players needs to bring them to the end as a group to succeed. Other levels have the penguins slide down hills with faster gameplay, feature mazes, or take place underwater where predators need to be avoided while collecting food. In the later parts of the game, guarding the eggs adds an new layer of difficulty. As soon as a penguin hits an obstacle it is dropped. There is little time to pick it up again or it freezes. It also need to be taken to a warm spot before the thermometer time runs out. Some educational content has also been included. Next to the habits, more information about the penguin migration in provided in between levels.</story>

    <story>Similarly to Mario Golf for Game Boy Color, Mario Golf- Advance Tour allows players to create two of their own custom characters and experience golf by progressing through an RPG-like story. The ultimate goal of the story is to make your player climb through the ranks of the various clubs, ultimately reaching the goal of the elite Mushroom Kingdom golfers, such as Princess Peach, Donkey Kong, and of course, Mario. It&apos;s possible to earn experience for either character either by playing through rounds of golf, or by successfully completing various types of mini-games and contests that help you hone your putting, swing, and other golf skills. Distributing experience is more difficult now, as you now have to make sure that both characters are sufficiently levelled up so that you can succeed in doubles matches as well as your solo play. Advance Tour also links up to Mario Golf- Toadstool Tour for the Nintendo GameCube. By doing this, you can earn even more experience points by transferring your characters over and playing the various modes in Toadstool Tour. Of course, it&apos;s also possible to link up to another copy of Advance Tour for GBA multiplayer too.</story>

    <story>The first portable incarnation of the Mario Party series, Mario Party Advance shakes things up quite a bit on the GBA. With the focus on the single-player, there are all kinds of single-player mini-games, one giant single-player board to traverse instead of multiple ones (Shroom City), and all kinds of different Gaddgets and gameplay modes to indulge in. The main single-player experience involves traveling across Shroom City, which is a major departure from the standard set-up in past Mario Party titles. You have the choice to be Mario, Luigi, Peach, or Yoshi, and depending on who you choose, you&apos;ll start at a different spot on the board, which is quite large. You&apos;re given die rolls to navigate the board and, when you reach special sections of the map, complete special quests, which often involve helping residents of Shroom City and/or participating in special challenges. Most quests involve collecting some sort of object elsewhere or a mini-game. By completing these quests, you&apos;ll collect stars, which eventually allow for special boss bouts with Bowser, and you&apos;ll unlock mini-games and Gaddgets, which are simple, toy-like contraptions that you can play with. The game ends when you complete your allotted number of turns, although additional turns and die rolls can be earned during the game by completing the Mushroom Challenges that occur rather often. After completing your session, your rewards are saved, and you can play with your mini-games and Gaddgets in Play Mode. There are also two additional modes available, Party Land, where you can play special duel mini-games with a friend, and Challenge Land, where you play through special modes that test your mini-game skills to earn coins, which can be used to purchase additional unlockables in a shop. Finally, there is also a feature called the Bonus Board. You can play with a board that is included with the game using the GBA. The GBA takes care of die rolls, mini-games, and end-of-the-game events.</story>

    <story>This is the standard Bowser has kidnapped the Princess, and Mario must rescue her story. In this case, the Princess is transformed into a ball and launched from a Super Mario 64-style cannon, which a pair of goombas aim directly at Bowser&apos;s Castle. Mario is also transformed into a ball and chases after her. There are 5 levels, each consisting of a set of pinball tables. Each table has some exits (including the one below the flippers) that Mario can use to move to other tables. Also, each one holds a star, normally obtained by defeating all enemies on the table. Some exits require that Mario has a certain number of stars. To gain access to Bowser&apos;s castle, Mario must defeat the bosses of the first 4 levels, which gives him star keys. The game also features a Time Attack mode, which allows players to fight already defeated bosses again.</story>

    <story>Mario Tennis- Power Tour is the portable sibling of Mario Power Tennis on the GameCube. Aside from the standard spins, drop shots, lobs, and smashes available in a standard game of tennis, Power Tour adds power shots into the mix. Offensive power shots can be used to end a long-rally in your favor, while defensive power shots can help you make an impossible save. Following in the footsteps of other portable Mario Sports titles, Power Tour adds a bit of RPG-like features into the mix of standard tennis action. Story mode has you guide either one of the rookie players, Max or Tina, through the ranks of competitors in the academy on their way to the Island Open Championships. Winning matches against opponents in the academy rewards you with points you can use to raise your stats. Matches can either be in one-on-one Singles matches, or you can team up with an AI-controlled partner in Doubles. In between matches, you are also given the opportunity to explore the academy and participate in training courts and several mini-games, such as weight-lifting, to further build up your stats. Exhibition modes are also available for quick pick-up-and-play gameplay. Multiplayer modes include Singles and Doubles matches where you can choose from the stock cast of characters or you can also opt to use your powered up characters from the Story mode against each other.</story>

The only chance for redemption lies withing a magical item that will allow mankind to atone for its sins. But the item in question has been stolen by the enemies of humanity, and the verdict of the gods will soon come to pass. Mazes of Fate is a fantasy medieval first person dungeon-crawler RPG in which you create a character based on gender, class and attributes (or take your pick from one of the three pre-made characters) and set out in a quest to save the human race from oblivion. The game alternates between world and town map sequences in which you control your party from an overhead perspective and visit shops and get quests from NPCs and the many dungeons that compose the bulk of the game itself. While dungeon crawling the game switches to a first-person perspective from which you control your party as it fights all the monsters that cross your path and loot the treasures uncovered. Combat is real-time although the game pauses while you navigate action menus. Features loads of items, weapons and quests, as well as tons of monsters and up to 5 recruit-able party members.</story>

    <story>Welcome to the world of MedaBots. MetaBots are robots that can have various parts upgraded and swapped to change and improve them. These parts can be purchased, or can be received as the spoils of battle if you win. Enter your character... a boy who loves MedaBots. Sent to the store to get Spice-A-Roni, he ends up with a MedaBot instead. From this point on, his life is thrown into Robattles with other MedaBots. MedaBots are made up of a basic body (male or female), four main parts (head, legs, right arm, and left arm), and a medal. The medal is what powers the MedaBot. All these parts can be changed. And because each part has multiple properties, you don&apos;t really upgrade your MedaBot... you just change it. Sometimes you will want a powerful weapon attack, sometimes you may want a less powerful weapon attack that can do Chain Damage or Status Damage. When you battle, you take turns based on the speed your MedaBot can reach the center of the field. After it attacks, you hurry back to the outside and then return to the center. This is really just a timer thing to show how the speed of your MedaBot is affecting the attack speeds. Your attack can damage the various parts of the other MedaBot(s) as long as it hits. Destroying a part will prevent the MedaBot from attacking with that part. Destroying the head will give you a victory even if you destroy nothing else. However, you cannot aim at each part. The defense rating of each part helps determine what is hit first. Follow the story as you gain experience and level up your MedaBot&apos;s medal to gain more powerful attacks, better aim, etc. Get more bodies and medals for MedaBots so you can battle with up to 3-on-3 battles.</story>

When he is talked into buying a Medabot instead of dinner, Ikki discovers it is missing a vital medal. When a mysterious man named Phantom Renegade gives his father a medal, Ikki can finally compete against other Medafighters in Robattles. However, an organization known as the Medamaniacs are stealing medals and Medaparts from kids. Ikki must track down the source of the trouble. Medabots can be built and customized using Medaparts. If a player wins a battle they get a Medapart, but if they lose, they must give up one of their Medaparts. In battle, turns are taken based on a Medabot&apos;s speed and how long it takes to get to the center of the battlefield, and after each turn they run back to the edge. Each Medapart has a defense rating, with damage depending on this. When a Medapart is destroyed, the Medabot can no longer use this Medapart to attack. When a Medabot&apos;s head is destroyed, the other Medabot wins. Storyline and gameplay are identical between Metabee and Rokusho, but there are version-exclusive Medabots and Medaparts.</story>

The game features a variety of arenas and opponents which will require the player to shuffle strategies from time to time, be it changing robot parts or battle style. Medaforce is available to every Medabot, but each one has an effect based from its medal. Medals can be trained to increase damage done with close attacks and ranged attacks, or to increase efficiency from support and defense. Medabots AX was only released in North America and is based on another game released only in Japan, Medarot G. Characters and robots were changed to fit the market. Two versions exist- Metabee and Rokusho. Even though the story is pretty similar between the games, some robot parts and medals are exclusive to a game. Battling and Trading using a Link Cable is possible and is the only way to collect every robot part and medal.</story>

    <story>Medal of Honor Infiltrator is a shooter from a top-down viewpoint. The top-down graphics and gameplay are reminiscent of classic games like Commando and Frontline. In its 15 total levels, Infiltrator brings together a variety of different play styles that should be familiar to anyone who&apos;s played their fair share of 8- and 16-bit games. You can hide behind houses and other buildings to stop enemy bullets. If you come across a stationary gun or a tank sitting in a level, you can put these weapons to use against the enemy. Each level has a number of mission objectives assigned to it, such as locating documents or destroying ammunition depots. To complete a level, you need to accomplish these goals. The difficulty level is, like its forerunners, high and urges the players all the time.</story>

    <story>The game is a prequel to Medal of Honor and it is set in the early stages of WWII. You play as Manon Batiste, who briefed the missions for you in the original Medal of Honor. She is a new member of a small band of French rebels who fight against the tyranny of the Germans. There are 7 missions in total, featuring 12 different historical weapons. There are NPCs helping you out by cracking safes and driving. Not all enemies are on foot; expect to face tanks and bikes amongst other things. Enemy AI is responsive and sometimes surprising.</story>

    <story>Lan, Chaud, Dex and other characters from the Mega Man Battle Network Universe prepare to duke it out in the Battle Chip GP! Take control of your favorite character and face off against many opponents as you make your way to the head of the GP to reach the ultimate prize, an incredibly rare battle chip! Gameplay is based around the Mega Man Battle Network series of games, in that players purchase and use various battle chips to combat their opponents. However, unlike the main games, players do not have direct control over their Net Navi. Instead, players pre-select their battle chips, and one of these chips are used in the battle against the opponent. Once selected, the game automatically plays out the battle. There is also a process called &apos;slotting in&apos;, which can be performed by pressing L or R during battle when your slot in gauge is full. Slotting in allows you to use an additional battle chip during gameplay to assist you. If successful, the chip will be used, and aid you with healing, dealing extra damage, and so on.</story>

    <story>It&apos;s been rather quiet after Lan and Mega Man defeated the WWW in Mega Man Battle Network 3. Little do they know that they&apos;re about to embark on yet another adventure. An asteroid has been spotted in outer space which is heading towards Earth, and scientists are planning to destroy it with a giant laser. In addition to this, a mysterious Navi called ShadeMan is terrorizing the Internet, sucking the life out of other Navis, much like a vampire. Can Lan and Mega Man stop this new threat? Mega Man Battle Network 4 is an RPG-like game, and a continuation of the Battle Network series. You play as two characters - a young boy, Lan, in the real world, and a Net Navi called Mega Man on the Internet. Lan can talk to people and interact with the real world, however, when he &apos;jacks in&apos; to the Internet, Mega Man takes over. In addition to interacting with Navis on the net, Mega Man also encounters random viruses and battles them in a mix of turn-based and real-time battle. A new feature of Battle Network 4 is the Soul Unison feature - as players progress through the game, they can defeat certain Navis and earn the ability to merge with them to become more powerful. The catch with this is that the Soul Unison only lasts for three turns, and that a particular Battle Chip is required to perform it. The Soul Unisons that you acquire through the game are specific to each version - to get them all, you must link up with a copy of Mega Man Battle Network 4- Red Sun. You can also trade different Battle Chips (some are exclusive to particular versions) and Net Battle with a friend.</story>

    <story>Lan and Mega Man return in the fifth entry to the Battle Network series of games. In this sequel, a mysterious group is distributing Dark Navi chips in the hope of corrupting Navis worldwide. Lan and his friends must storm the Dark Chip Factory and put a stop to this problem before it becomes any worse. The game uses an RPG style over-world in which Lan and Mega Man navigate and interact. In the real world, you control Lan, and can interact with objects and talk to people. When you need to enter cyberspace, you &apos;jack-in&apos;, and take control of Mega Man. Mega Man must also battle viruses in addition to navigating through the internet. This is done with a combination of action and turn-based battle, where you select powerful chips to give you an edge each turn, then use the chips and dodge shots in realtime. The game also features Liberation Missions, which are a more traditional turn-based style of play. In this mode, you must &apos;liberate&apos; dark tiles on your way to confront the boss. Liberation Missions play somewhat like a complicated game of chess, with the player actually fighting the battles between the pieces. Unique to this version of the game is the ability to play as Colonel partway through the story. The game can also link up to Mega Man Battle Network 5- Team Protoman to trade and complete your battle chip collection - certain chips are only available in one version of the game.</story>

Lan and Mega Man quickly make new friends, and find out about the legend of the Cybeasts, two ancient creatures with such power that they eventually destroyed each other. However, a shady organization is intent on reviving and controlling the Cybeasts for their own nefarious needs, and Mega Man gets caught in the middle! While they capture the wolf-like Gregar, Mega Man captures the phoenix-like Falzar. By harnessing this new power, Lan and Mega Man must save the internet once again! Mega Man Battle Network 6 is an RPG-like game in which you navigate through both the real world, and the cyberworld of the internet. As Lan, you move through the real world, interacting with people and finding places to &apos;jack-in&apos; to the cyberworld for Mega Man to take control. As Mega Man, you can fight viruses in a hybrid of turn-based and real-time battle- you select which battle chips you need to use each turn, and then use them while actively dodging enemy fire. New to Battle Network 6 is the Cross Change system. After beating certain enemy Navis, Mega Man can copy their strengths (as well as their weaknesses!) and use them to his advantage, similar to the original Mega Man games. For example, you could take on the aqua power of Aqua Man, or the cutting power of Tomahawk Man. At a certain point in the game, Mega Man also gains control of the powerful Cybeast, Falzar. Using this power, Mega Man can transform into a phoenix-like Navi, boosting his attack power for three turns, and enhance the power of certain battle chips. If players continue to push Mega Man, he will enter the Beast Over state, with even more power, but at the loss of control and a severely weakened Mega Man. It&apos;s also possible to combine the Cross Change with Falzar, creating even more powerful attacks. This game also links up to Mega Man Battle Network 6- Cybeast Gregar. Players can trade battle chips that are specific to each version, or net battle against each other.</story>

But as time went on, the army became oppressive, and began to deal out a paranoid brand of justice. It is said that their leader, once a great warrior, has become cold and calculating, eliminating any Reploid that dares oppose him. A hero is needed in these dark times, and that is exactly what Ciel and her rebel group have found in an old ruin...a hero from the past, reborn in the future.

    <story>In the third installment of Capcom&apos;s Mega Man Zero series, you, unsurprisingly, play as Zero. Continuing where the Mega Man Zero 2 left off, you have to find and neutralize the recently escaped Dark Elf, before it&apos;s able to brainwash the Resistance for the purpose of conquering Neo Arcadia. In addition to the old Cyber Elf system, this game also contains a new chip system, where Zero can gain new abilities by finding chips and installing chip in himself. But they didn&apos;t decide to abandon the Cyber Elves in this game by giving them nothing new. No, in order to extend the life of the Cyber Elves, they added the new concept of Cyber Space to levels, where you enter a door to Cyber Space and are allowed to use each Cyber Elf as much as you please without them dying. However, there aren&apos;t too many Secret Disks (items that can contain anything from profiles of characters to Cyber Elves to new chips) in Cyber Space, so it&apos;s better to spend more time in the normal level.</story>

    <story>Pirates have stolen an unknown life-form, recently discovered on the planet SR388. The life-form, called Metroid, is in a state of suspended animation and, according to analysis, was the cause of the complete destruction of SR388. If it ever got loose, the alien could destroy countless other systems. The pirates have taken the being to the planet Zebes and are fending off the Galactic Federation&apos;s attacks. It is up to the space bounty hunter Samus Aran to find her way into the planet&apos;s core, destroy the pirates, and take back the alien before the pirates complete their plans of world destruction. Zero Mission takes Samus back to her first battle with Mother Brain, expanding on the original story line and action from the original Nintendo classic, Metroid, with updated visuals, new puzzles to solve, and cut scenes filling in the personal story of Samus. The player can perform moves taken from the original game, along with additions taken from the last GBA mission, Metroid Fusion, including the power grab. This game can also be linked to Metroid Fusion to unlock special extras.</story>

    <story>Metroid Fusion is the direct sequel to 1994&apos;s Super Metroid. The game begins as Samus Aran is sent back to planet SR388 to assist a Biologic Space Labs investigation team. While on the planet&apos;s surface, Samus is infected by a previously unknown parasite, known as X. The X parasite nearly kills Samus, but fortunately she is saved by a vaccine made from the Metroid she saved on Zebes. Shortly thereafter, an explosion rocks the Biologic Space Labs. Now Samus must investigate the Space Labs, which are orbiting SR388. This game is similar, in terms of gameplay and structure, to the classic side-scrolling Metroid games. The game consists of a large inter-connected environment. As Samus learns a variety of new moves and weapons, she is able to explore new areas of the Space Lab and unlock the secrets of the X parasite.</story>

    <story>Monster Rancher Advance is a monster raising sim that allows players to raise and customize 440 monster types. These monsters can then be tested in in-game tournaments, or battled against other players in 2P mode with the GBA link cable. Monsters are created in the game&apos;s shrine through the entry of letters, numbers and punctuation symbols. Players begin with the ability to enter up to 4 characters to make monsters, and can unlock the ability to use up to 8 characters through gaining higher trainer ranks. Different words or combinations of characters can not only make different types of monsters, but each monster can have varying attributes and characteristics, making each one unique. Players then train the monsters by choosing which foods to feed, which drills to do to raise attributes, what training to send them to for new attacks, and what items to give them. The game starts with a modest amount of money with which food and items can be purchased, more money is earned in tournaments. Gameplay revolves around planning training sessions, adding new attacks and juggling a bank account, along with attempting to win tournaments. As monsters age, they can be added to a coaching staff to help raise new monsters to better attributes, or they can be combined with other monsters to make stronger babies. Monsters do not die in this game, however, they do face an enforced retirement age. There is a fairly straightforward storyline, where some characters from older Monster Rancher games visit, and new characters are introduced. The gameplay itself, like most other Monster Rancher games, is open-ended and has unlimited replay value. The 2 Player mode, involving a link cable and two copies of the game, allows players to test the monsters they have raised against other players. The 2P mode also allows players to trade items and cash with one another, to wager items or cash on tournaments, and trade raised monsters into each others&apos; games.</story>

    <story>Monster Rancher Advance 2 is a monster raising sim where players can raise, battle, explore with any of 512 monsters. While it is the second Monster Rancher game on the Game Boy Advance system, it is not a true sequel, and does not require any knowledge of any other ranching games to play. Players make monsters by entering letters, numbers, and punctuation characters into the in-game shrine. At the start, players have access to up to 4 spaces to enter words or characters. As they improve their rank as a trainer, they can access more spaces, up to a maximum of 8. Players may also bring monsters into the game from their Monster Rancher Advance game, or trade monsters with other Monster Rancher Advance 2 players through use of a second GBA and a link cable. Players then raise their monster, deciding what foods to feed them, what drills to teach attributes at, what items to give them, what attacks to add in training, and which characteristics to add or remove at the Hospital. Monsters may become hurt or ill, and can be treated for a fee at the Hospital which also offers free checkups. Players start with a modest sum of money, and earn more by winning in-game tournaments, or by finding valuable items to sell on expeditions. The storyline is one of the longest and most complex of any Monster Rancher game. Unlocking various types of monsters involves participating in a variety of events including storyline quests on expeditions, and battling in various tournaments. Players will see characters from older Monster Rancher games, and be introduced to new characters. Monsters now develop bonds with each other and can become friends with monsters within the game, and with monsters in other player&apos;s games via link cable use. Completing the storyline requires over 200 hours of gameplay. Monsters do not die in this game, but they do face an enforced retirement age. When retired, they can coach other monsters to improve drills, and be used in combining to make stronger baby monsters with more attacks and better characteristics. This game has several improvements over the previous Game Boy Advance game including- a counter system added to battles, RPG style expeditions, a monster buddy system, a more complex coaching for pay system, super coaches, the ability to add or remove characteristics, diseases, tag team battles, more hidden monsters, and a new breed of monster. In 2 Player mode, monsters can battle against other player&apos;s monsters via the GBA link cable. Single monsters can face off against each other, or players can set up tag team battles.</story>

    <story>Although the name implies you&apos;re going to catch monsters, Monster! Bass Fishing is a normal fishing game where you can catch a variety of fish including various bass, northern pike, catfish, and more. The monster part is that you get bonus points for catching monster-sized fish. The game is played in one of two modes, Challenge or Free Fish. In Free Fish, you can fish in any location that is unlocked for as long as you like. In Challenge, you are competing in a tournament and will have a time limit and a specific location to fish at. When you start at a location in either mode, you have the option to move your boat to any place on the map. However, this does take time and may not always be in your best interest in the Challenge mode. You can then either start casting, or you can change your lure first. Catching fish is really just a matter of using a good lure and tempting movements. When a fish strikes, you need to keep enough pressure on the line to keep the hook set, or the fish will get away. If you let the line get too tight, the line will break and you&apos;ll lose the fish then as well. Now just reel it in and see what you caught. The GUI shows a nice fish finder that is color-coded by the type of fish that is seen. Note that this finder is not always accurate. Statistics for the game are very nice. You can see a nice picture of your fish that you catch along with the size of it. The top 6 can then be saved in the Aquarium for viewing at any time. Your tournament scores will be based on weight of fish and any monster bonuses (bonuses for catching one of the top 3 largest fish that round). Winning the tournaments will unlock new locations and let you progress to a new location for the next tournament. It will also get you a nice trophy.</story>

However, to make things difficult, Randal has destroyed her door. Avoid Randall and the CDA (Child Detection Agency) as well as other dangers as you try getting Boo home. This platform scroller will have you trying to find out where you have been as you make your way through multiple doorways, up and down ladders, and more.

    <story>Moorhen 3 ...Chicken Chase is a shooter still in the same style as the first Moohrhuhn. The player has a gun and he shoots chickens which fly over the screen. If they are far away, they give more points. After six shots the player has to reload the weapon (which gives a time penalty). The time is limited, the screen can be scrolled left and right and the ultimate goal is to improve the own highscore. In this game the only background is set at a sea. New features are more different animals to shoot, including the Lesshühner which give negative points. Two new ammo types are more powerful but limited and have to be earned by shooting certain things. There are multiple hidden extras to find, e.g. ways to extend the playing time. In the PC version there is an online highscore list.</story>

    <story>Moto Racer Advance is the first adaptation of the motorcycle racing series for a handheld platform. The core concept is similar to the original games- players race on asphalt or all-terrain tracks. The game offers different game modes- single race, championship, league and progression. The latter is the game&apos;s main mode as it offers a path for the three main racing styles- Cross, GP and Traffic. By winning races additional locations, bikes and tricks are unlocked. Each of the three paths can be followed separately, they do not need to be completed in a specific order. A fourth style called Ultimate is unlocked later on in the game. Bikes have different statistics based on maximum speed, acceleration, brakes and grip. Some of the available locations include California, England, Kenya, Moscow and San Francisco. GP tracks have a set number of laps and an amount of opponents needs to be passed before reaching the finish line. It puts the focus on using brakes effectively to go through corners in a fluent manner. The off-road terrain tracks in the Cross mode are similar in concept, but demands mastery of powersliding to pass corners. They also have bumps and rougher terrain. The traffic style is a mix with both types of terrain, but introduces AI-controlled traffic that needs to be dodged. Signs above the racer show upcoming corners with a different colour based on the sharpness and they also warn for obstacles. While racing a nitro is available to do a wheelie and gain more speed. It can be depleted, but regenerates over time. The top of the screen holds the time and shows a horizontal bar with the positions of all riders. Multiplayer games for up to four racers simultaneously are available through a link cable.</story>

In Rarity&apos;s Adventure, the main game mode, Cheerilee teaches the young unicorn pony Rarity in the magical city Unicornia how to make a rainbow. In celebration of the first rainbow of the season. Rarity will become the rainbow princess and she needs to learn how to use her magical wand to create it. Rarity can freely move around the city and talk to other pones. She plays mini-games and gets to help them in various ways. She can play with a caterpillar, participate in a bubble fight to clean a carriage, do a game of &apos;Simon Says&apos; with her wand, collect rainbow ribbons and flags and colour drawings. At the end of the first chapter she accidentally uses the wand in a wrong way and ends up in a new location called Breezie Blossom. Rarity has to perform similar tasks again for her there, such as locating characters, collecting pairs of pajamas, locate hidden breezies in a game of &apos;Whac-A-Mole&apos; and catch rainbowberries. In the third chapter Rarity and the breezies travel to Ponyville while the other ponies at Unicornia decide to look for her. Rarity gets to choose between two playable ponies to help her locate additional rainbowberries after she ate all of them. With different ingredients sundaes need to be recreated as shown through an example in the top left corner of the screen. In another mission various components to create kites need to be gathered and identical kites need to be matched in a game of Concentration. Rarity also gets to skate, avoiding and jumping over objects on a course. It also contains a full pinball table called Pinkie Pie Pinball. In the fourth chapter she can create and colour custom drawings. Rarity drops down a river and needs to be picked up along with several other ponies using a vine. Players also have to help her create images in the sky by connecting stars and she gets to ride a flying carriage, avoiding clouds that slow her down, to reach a finish line before time runs out. In the fifth and final chapter the rainbow celebration finally takes place. There are five chapters and fourteen mini-games in total. From the main menu the different mini-games can be played right away. During the main Rarity&apos;s Adventure mode jewels can be earned by performing well.

    <story>Naruto- Ninja Council is another game that was taken from a famous Japanese anime series and is also the first installment of the Ninja Council series. It&apos;s a side scrolling, action oriented game with two modes to choose - Story mode and Free mode - and two playable characters. The story of Ninja Council starts from the survival exam and ends with Orochimaru’s attack at the Hidden Konoha Village. Apart from that there are no actual events between that - that take place on the anime although there are fights with certain characters that do like the fight with Haku and Orochimaru. The characters that are available are Naruto and Sasuke. When you start a new game at the beginning of each stage Kakashi sensei appears to give you hints about the controls and other useful staff like a boss’ weak point or attack patterns. There are also hidden characters you can find who can restore your health when you run out of life. Stages have a time limit of 5 minutes to complete. At the end of each stage there is a boss fight and the timer resets at 5 minutes in which you have to win the battle in order to advance the game and be able to save your progress. The two available characters - Naruto and Sasuke - can both use the same combo hits and weapons that can be picked up in each stage like shuriken and kunai. Every second stage the player will also find scrolls that contain elemental power ups like the Lightning Style Scroll that can be used either for attacking opponents or for progressing in the game. Apart from that each one has a set of three unique special attacks that can be used but only if you have sufficient amount of chakra.</story>

    <story>This is the second Naruto title for the Ninja Council series and follows the adventures of Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura as they try to pass the Chunin Exam in a total of seven stages. Unlike the first title you can now control three characters by changing them anytime you want inside the game. Each one has unique sequences of punches and kicks and can use 3 special techniques with varying results from one character to another. The shuriken, kunai and fuma from the first game are still here although this time one hit is enough to dispatch an enemy. Along the stages you can also find summoning scrolls and use them in fights to call Kakashi, Choji and others to attack the enemies. Another addition to the gameplay is the Teleport move which as the name implies allows you to teleport near or behind an enemy to attack him or simply dodge his attacks. At parts of each stage you may be given certain objectives such as to defeat all the enemies or finish the stage within a time limit and parameters like the use of only one character. At the end of each stage you get a grade depending on how many enemies you killed, how fast you finished the stage, how many characters you are left and how many leaves you have collected. At the end of the game these grades will be accumulated to decide your final rank. The game also features two additional modes – the Co-op Mode and the Vs. Mode but you need the link cable for that.</story>

The game comes with 4 official and 6 fictional players. The Game Boy Advance version of the game is mostly the same as its bigger brother on the PC and PlayStation 2. Differences are mostly of a graphical nature (2D instead of 3D). It does lack one of the game modes however and controls tailored to the handheld console. The game features the following game modes- arcade, training, exhibition, career, and multi-player. All modes can be played in both singles and doubles. The arcade mode allows you to unlock new courts, players and gear. In the career mode you can start out small and use the cash prizes to further train your character and buy better gear.

    <story>NHL 2002 is the only entry in Electronic Arts&apos; hockey series to be released on the Game Boy Advance. With the console versions having migrated to 3D graphics years earlier, the handheld game retains a 2D top-down view very similar to the earliest titles in the series on the Genesis and SNES. Besides a standard mode for exhibition games, the game has a practice mode where the number of players on the field can be freely chosen. Season mode is unusual in that, unlike in other games, the player doesn&apos;t select a team to lead through a season. Instead, the game includes the full game schedule of the 2001-2002 NHL season, and any team in any scheduled game can be played. If no games of interest are scheduled on a given day, it can be skipped and the results simulated. The season mode also includes the ability to trade players, sign free agents and even to create players. The game also includes a multi player mode over the link cable, with up to four players able to join for cooperative or competitive play.</story>

The game&apos;s Season mode now allows for trades, stat tracking, and player awards. Up to four players can play each other in exhibition mode. Season mode puts you into a standard NHL schedule, but you can change to a shorter season if you want. There is also a small numer of hockey-related minigames, such as keep-away. Franchise mode is where you pick and name your team, name your players, and play against other teams to earn experience points. Those points can be used to upgrade your players in categories such as toughness, speed, passing, and agility. After beating all the lesser teams in a tier, you can move on to battle a boss team for that region. Beating that team nets you some new equipment for your players, which also improves their stats.</story>

    <story>No Rules- Get Phat is an action game where the player controls the little boy One Eye Jack. While he is watching television the broadcast is interrupted by aliens who announce to invade the planet. Jack sets out to stop that. The game contains five worlds that consist of 2D side-scrolling platforming environments. Jack moves to the left or right on his skateboard and is able to duck, and jump to dodge enemies and obstacles and to get on top of platforms. A slingshot is used to attack, as well as a spinning move. He can aim to the right as well as upwards. Levels encourage exploration and often have a vertical design where he can use windows to reach higher parts of a level. Jack has a limited amount of health replenished by grabbing first aid kits. There is a set amount of lives and additional ones are collected by finding icons that represent his head. There are also sections where he can grind rails, ledges and horizontal surfaces and grab vinyl records. By collecting all of them in a single level, additional moves and tricks are unlocked. Next to the platforming sections he needs to defeat aliens at the end of levels in sequences similar to the Dance Dance Revolution games where the directional buttons need to be pressed at the right moment to match the beat, appearing in a bar from the right side of the screen in a vinyl shop. This leaves the alien open to an attack and the A button is then used to scratch and attack. The game package includes a physical fingerboard.</story>

    <story>Young warrior, Onimaru is given the Oni Gauntlet as he rushes to defend his village from the demon hordes of Nobunaga Oda. Onimaru soon discovers from the old man Sandayu, that although he has been living in the peaceful province of Iga, he is of the Oni clan and had been secreted away. Additionally, with the power of the Oni Gauntlet, he can absorb the souls of enemies and use the demon Genma stones to recreate lost weapons and armor. With this new knowledge of who his is and of his destiny, he assembles a hasty squad of fighters including his sister Ororo and sets off to avenge his province and stop Nobunaga&apos;s demonic war upon the land. Onimusha Tactics is a turn-based strategy game between the player&apos;s side and the enemy&apos;s side. In each level you can bring a squad of no more than 10 people. There are no items to buy or sell, however equipment is available and customizable. Upgrades of existing weapons and armor can be done using the defeated souls of enemies absorbed into the Oni Gauntlet. New weapons and armor can be found or created through fusion of Genma Stones. Recipes must be found for each separate item before it can be fused. Most characters have a normal attack, the ability to use items and several special techniques for battle. Additionally there is an issen ability that randomly shows up and allows your character to counter-attack and instantly kill any enemy who foolishly attacks that character directly in the next round.</story>

    <story>Open Season for GBA is based on the movie and it is a completely different game experience than the console version. The story in the game follows the movie pretty well and it is well presented through in-game and comic dialog style cinematics. It&apos;s about a Grizzly bear named Boog who is very happy with his domesticated home. But one day he gets in trouble with his new friend Elliot and the town&apos;s authority decides to put them back in the woods where they belong. Unfortunately, for them, the hunting season has just begun and Boog has no idea how to survive outside of his garage home with his beloved caretaker, Beth. The game begins just before Boog and Elliot are dropped in the woods. You control Boog and he has many cool moves. He can jump, roll, grab and throw forest animals as well as roar. The goal of the game is to protect the forest animals from the hunters. The forest is full of hunters and boss hunters in each animal territory. It is your job to clean up the forest so play it wild and rally an army of forest critters in a hilarious quest to scare off the hunters!</story>

Levels consist of either traditional sink-the-ball mini-golf holes or levels with objects that must be broken by the ball. Hammy the squirrel must run around levels to move objects so that the path to the hole is clear, while other movie characters actually hit the ball. Players must complete each hole at or under par in order to unlock Challenge Mode, which consists of harder levels. The game also consists of a single cartridge multiplayer mode where players pass the GBA to up to 3 other players to compete against each other.</story>

    <story>Pirates of the Caribbean 2- Dead Man’s Chest is a swashbuckling sidescroller for the Game Boy Advance, based on the movie of the same name. The game has two main modes of seafaring adventure. The first is an action sidescroller, where players take control of the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow as he tries to reclaim his soul back from Davy Jones. He&apos;ll run, jump, and battle cannibals, pirates, the royal navy, and Davy Jones&apos; monstrous crew across 15 islands, each made up of several maps. Between the islands, players gets to captain Sparrow&apos;s ship, the Black Pearl. They&apos;ll need to equip her with food (otherwise the crew might mutiny!), cannons, and supplies enough to fend off privateers and pirates on the open sea. Radically different than versions of the same title on other platforms, the Game Boy Advance version gives players a lot of gameplay variety over the course of the game. The open-ended island exploration, ship-to-ship battles, and RPG-lite upgrade system means that players can play this game in many different ways.</story>

    <story>Pokémon Emerald is the fifth Pokémon game of the advanced generation, after its predecessors Ruby, Sapphire, FireRed, and LeafGreen. It takes place in the world of Hoenn but can also connect with Kanto-based games FireRed and LeafGreen as well. Like Pikachu and Suicune were for Yellow and Crystal respectively, Rayquaza plays a vital role in this game along with the other Legendaries, Groudon and Kyogre. Though similar to the original storyline that occurs in Hoenn, Emerald offers more changes than Yellow and Crystal. In terms of gameplay, there have been several alterations to the game- Legendaries 1. Ability to catch Rayquaza before the Elite Four, as well as both Groudon and Kyogre after it. 2. Changes to catching the Regis. 3. Ability to catch either one of Latios or Latias. Graphics 1. New outfits for the characters. 4. New Pokémon animations. Features 1. Ability to enter the Safari Zone Extension, where you can catch Johto (the world of Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal) Pokémon like Houndour and Miltank. 5. The Battle Frontier, an island full of different battle stadiums. 6. Ability to get both of the Claw and Root fossils. These are of the changes you might notice at first while playing Pokémon Emerald. However, there are lots of other improvements apart from the new storyline that separates this game from its predecessors.</story>

Simply hit the required areas of the board with the ball and you&apos;ll capture the monster available. There&apos;s 200 to find in total. Two different boards are on offer, each based on the two versions of Pokemon for GBA (i.e. Ruby and Sapphire).

    <story>Polarium Advance is basically the same as Polarium for the Nintendo DS, but a couple of new blocks have been added. This is a puzzle game in which the player must create horizontal lines of all the same color (either black or white). To change the color (or polarity) of a block, you must select the blocks in one line. In most puzzles, you can use the border to lengthen the line. The new blocks in the Advance version are- Hurdle Tiles, which you cannot pass, Multi-Tiles, which count as black or white, and Solid Tiles, which will not turn but are removed so that the tiles above them fall down. There are 365 puzzles in this mode (Daily Polarium) ranging from very easy to quite challenging. The Time Attack Mode requires you to solve either ten easy puzzles or five hard puzzles within the time given. Leaving a block of the wrong color in a line results in a 30 seconds penalty. It is possible to create your own puzzles and share them with friends. Puzzles created in the Nintendo DS version of the game are compatible with the GBA version.</story>

There&apos;s also a Shadow Ranger who has special abilities players will uncover as they progress through the game. Each level in this platformer has players running, jumping, and attacking enemies as they guide the chosen ranger through the many obstacles that Gruumm has created. Each of the nine levels is controlled by a boss that the Rangers must defeat to move on. After certain levels, the Rangers will summon the Megazord to do battle with giant monsters. Fans of the POWER RANGERS won&apos;t want to miss this installment in the series. POWER RANGERS- SPACE PATROL DELTA is an out-of-this-world fighting experience. </story>

Ms. Keene has given the girls a list of different items that can be found in the city. Along the way, Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup will run into familiar villains such as Mojo Jojo, Fuzzy Lumpkins, The Gangreen Gang, the Boogie Man, and of course... HIM. Him and Seek is a side-scrolling adventure game starring the Powerpuff Girls. There&apos;s no platforming required in this game, as the girls can fly everywhere. Instead, it plays like a combination of a beat-em-up and a point and click adventure game. The girls will need to perform tasks for Townsville citizens to get items for their scavenger hunt list, ranging from destroying crazy monsters, to finding lost wallets, to beating up the Gangreen Gang to get a tooth! Initially, you can only control one girl at a time, attacking with punches and kicks, shooting laser beams, and dashing. However, later the girls decide to team up, and you can switch girls on the fly by pressing the L Button. There are also some cool mini-games, such as an excellent pinball machine, a Dance Dance Revolution-like dance-off against the Boogie Man, and a Frogger parody where you control Mojo Jojo as you help him escape from jail and avoid capture by the Powerpuff Girls.</story>

Including all 32 teams participating in the tournament rated in four areas (defense, midfield, attack and overall) with fictional player names (although fans will quickly recognize who T. Brinks and M. Pallack from Germany, Manillas from Spain and Romualdo of Brazil are), players can take part in friendlies, play the World Cup (the real 2006 groups are included, but it&apos;s possible to randomize them) or train for penalty shootouts. Gameplay is simple and straightforward. A and B buttons control kicking the ball (low and high, respectively), being possible to shoot at goal using either one, all depending on distance to goal. After kicking the ball, the player can add aftertouch to the ball tapping the d-pad, making it go away from the goalkeeper of from a defender. The R button allows the player to accelerate, as long as he has enough stamina, shown by white circles under his name. Several tactical options such as formation, strategy and individual orders are included.</story>

    <story>The wedding anniversary for Penny Proud&apos;s parents is close, and that means its time to get them a present! Penny made something herself, but her friends said that she should get them a T.H.A.N.G.(or Total Home Automated Necessity Gizmo) instead. It&apos;s very expensive, but much cheaper if you buy it in pieces and self-assemble it. So Penny needs to spend time working jobs to get enough money to buy it. The video game for The Proud Family can best be described as a side-scrolling adventure game. Players navigate through Penny&apos;s neighborhood, being informed of odd jobs that Penny can take to earn money. Anything from picking up litter to working at the local Pizza Parlor, to finding neighbors&apos; lost dogs on the streets. Once Penny has earned enough money for a T.H.A.N.G. part, she can go to the store to buy it, and then the next chapter begins. The game also has mini-games which are based around Penny&apos;s official &apos;jobs&apos; that she receives. For example, she works for her dad at his factory, combining various snacks to please three different judges. Another mini-game has Penny competing in a dance-off. And at Chez Wizard, she has to take up a waitress job, where she greets and seats customers, takes their orders, delivers their food, takes the payment, and clears the dirty dishes. On top of this, it all has to be done quickly to satisfy the customers! Certain areas in the game also present themselves as photo opportunities. If Penny stands close enough to a star marker and presses the R Button, she&apos;ll get a photo of one of the characters from the show that will be stored in her photo album. If she&apos;s not close enough, she&apos;ll just get a fuzzy photo of a UFO instead.</story>

    <story>Accord, teacher of the local magic school, has lost her magic flying cane. There is word of an award so the students are busy searching high and low for it. Naturally our heros, Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine, make their way toward the distant dark castle. Challenging, and being challenged by, everyone you come across in a game of, Puyo Pop! A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by is the combining four or more of the same color which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto you opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos. When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen you can try to offset by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to you opponent. When any players field becomes so full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game. Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.</story>

    <story>This handheld racing game offers a range of licensed cars, several courses and circuits, and a challenging set of opponents. To these stock elements, it adds one more- weaponry. Now you can choose to nitro past the opponent ahead of you, or slow him down with a missile. With each vehicle and driver pair you can race in Practice Mode to familiarize yourself with tracks or choose a Championship Mode to progress through a series of circuits. After each race you&apos;ll need to spend some of the money you&apos;ve earned (either by placing or picking up money icons during the race) to repair and -- if possible -- upgrade your car. The upgrades can improve your car as a racing machine (e.g. a larger engine or better brakes) or as a war machine (e.g. adding more weapons bays or buying a new type of weapon). The track design uses the isometric view, and almost never puts the car behind an obstacle. However, among the twisty roads are a few shortcuts that require you to think outside the lines of the road, and occasionally take a leap of faith.</story>

Using a similar game style to the Game Boy classic, Tetris Attack, a line of blocks sits above the play field which you can change the order of and drop two at a time onto the blocks below. Once a Detoblock (a block that is different in appearance to the usual blocks) appears, drop it onto the corresponding colour to clear those blocks from the field. Play modes include Clear (clean the playfield of all blocks), Puzzle (try and clear all blocks within a set number of drops), Marathon (the usual play as far as you can mode) and Rescue Mode, where you must clear the blocks from the top of a cage, in which the many monsters from the arcade hit, Rampage World Tour, are trapped in. 2 player modes include Rescue (free the monster before the opponent to win), Score (score the most points in 1 minute) and Attack, in which the blocks you clear from your field appear on the opponents screen.</story>

    <story>A spin-off in the Rayman series, Hoodlum&apos;s Revenge takes place directly after the events from Rayman 3- Hoodlum Havoc and for the first in the series, aside from multi-player games, Rayman&apos;s friend Globox is featured as a playable character. After Rayman defeated the Hoodlums&apos; leader, Andre, the Hoodlums decide do get revenge (hence the title), so they kidnap Rayman&apos;s best friend Globox. Rayman rescues Globox part-way through the game, and as the two of them find out more about the Hoodlums trying to clone Reflux, they decide to stop them for good this time. The game has slightly pixelated 3-D action gameplay under a fixed 2.5D isometric camera view (a first in the series). Several of the levels are puzzles in which the player must change control from Rayman to Globox in order to flip a switch or hold a button down to allow them to continue.</story>

Secretly plotting over the years, they have at last unleashed their armies, ready to take over the world! They&apos;ve captured Rayman and all of his friends, stolen Rayman&apos;s fists, and scattered the precious Lums far and wide! Guess who has to save the day once again? Unlike the console version of Rayman Raving Rabbids, the Game Boy Advance version of the game sticks to its classic side scrolling platformer roots, like the original Rayman. Rayman can jump, glide with his hair for short distances, hurl his fists or throw a charged punch, pick up and hurl explosive barrels and other items, and even grapple onto special purple Lums, using them to swing. New to Rayman Raving Rabbids is Rayman&apos;s ability to gain special powers by changing into different costumes based on musical styles, such as hip-hop, punk, pop and rock. Each costume gives Rayman a specific ability which allows him to reach areas he previously couldn&apos;t and defeat enemies.</story>

    <story>Rayman returns in an all new adventure with all new abilities, but the same humor that has pervaded the series. Globox, a friend of Rayman, has placed the world in peril. By eating the Lord of the Dark Lums, Globox has enraged the Hoodlums, who plan to take back their master no matter what the cost to the world around them. It&apos;s up to Rayman to save the day and find a cure to rid the Dark Lord from Globox. New abilities, thanks to power ups littered around the levels, allow Rayman to use the likes of Heavy Metal Fist and the Shock Rocket to take down enemies around him, while the lock jaw allows Rayman to get to hard to reach places. Rayman 3 can link to a Gamecube via the link port, allowing players to play exclusive mini-games on both systems and download new levels to the GBA.</story>

With no more light, evil creatures begin to roam, making the world unsafe for everyone. Its up to you, as Rayman, to free your friends and put an end to Mr. Dark&apos;s dastardly schemes! Rayman is side-scrolling platformer starring the titular Rayman, a big-nosed chap with no arms or legs. Rayman can jump and use his hair to hover for a short period of time. He can also attack by throwing his fists, or winding up his fists for a more powerful punch. He can occasionally find special power ups that grant him unlimited flying power, giving him the ability to navigate through tricky mazes. Aside from the platforming action, the other notable feature of Rayman is its large, detailed and vibrant graphics, which have helped it to stand out from most other similar games in the genre.</story>

    <story>Rebelstar- Tactical Command is a turn-based strategy game in the same vein as X-Com, and is based off the Rebelstar strategy game setting. The developer, Codo Technologies, is composed of staff who have worked on games such as Laser Squad Nemesis, X-Com, and the original Laser Squad and Rebelstar Raiders. R-TC offers a similar style of play, and it may appeal to fans those titles and turn-based strategy games. In Rebelstar- TC, players take control of a squad of 6 soldiers in a series of battles against an alien oppressor. The main character is Jorel, a young recruit to the rebel cause against the antagonist Arelian species. As the game and story progresses, Jorel will rise up the ranks to lead and recruit additional characters, each with a particular specialization of skills. In addition to fighting the Arelians, players will also do battle with the brutish shock troops of the Zorn, the insect-like Fraylar, and a variety of lesser creatures and robots. Gameplay revolves around the player completing a series of battles in order to progress the plot. Prior to the start of most missions, players must select the characters that will participate in the battle and equip them appropriately. Rebelstar- TC offers a wide range of weapons, including melee, assault rifles, SMGs, sniper rifles, and heavy weapons. Firearms may also offer different firing modes, such as single shot, limited burst fire, and full automatic. Other equipment include different types of body armor, grenades, power cells, and medical kits. Characters have a number of statistics that govern their movement, speed, weapon use, stealth, and other skills. As the game proceeds and characters perform various actions, they gain experience points and level up. Each level up provides an opportunity for the player to add skill points to a chosen skill. The greater the skill rating, the better the character can perform or utilize weapons and equipment. The battles themselves are turn-based in nature, with the player moving and performing actions with his characters, then the enemy side doing the same once the player is done. Each character has a pool of Action Points to spend on actions during a turn. A character can thus perform a series of actions until he or she runs out of points. These action points refill at the beginning of the player&apos;s next turn. Players can also spend all of the character&apos;s points to place him on Overwatch. On this mode, a character will spend his stored action points on firing on any enemy that comes into his view, which is useful if you wish to have a character cover certain areas. Battles also take into account line of sight, terrain deformation (ie- walls blown up by explosives), and morale. All of these features give quite a number of tactical options and considerations to the game.</story>

    <story>Road Rash- Jailbreak for the GBA features the classic Road Rash gameplay; motorcycle racing on busy streets, with dirty tricks both allowed and expected. Several game modes are included. Wild Race is a basic race, just you versus several computer bikers in a race to the finish line. Use your fists or items you find along the way to knock opponents off their bike and into the hands of law enforcement. Cop Patrol puts you into the shoes of Marshall Lee, to take down those no-good motorcycling thugs. Time Attack is pure racing; just you, the road, and a ticking clock. Survival mode doesn&apos;t allow you to restart a race if you lose, so you&apos;ll need to complete all races on the first try. Finally, a 2-player mode is included. Three different characters are included, each with distinct strengths and a special weapon. Between races, you can upgrade your chosen character. Saving is possible through passwords, and both your current upgrades and unlocked tracks will be remembered.</story>

    <story>Similar to Gadget Racers, your goal is to complete multiple challenges to open to tracks and challenges in order to win the game. Finish in the top 3 in each challenge and win money to upgrade your car. There are over 100 upgrades available such as new engines, tires, steering wheels, shifters... even new car bodies and paint. The game consists of 150 challenges on 60 different tracks. These come in the form of standard racing, drag racing, stopping on time within an area, jumping onto bullseyes, running circles around a cone, and more. You&apos;ll never be bored from doing the same thing on the same track. Enjoy tracks that are paved, sand, and snow. Also, enjoy racing in the rain where traction is poor. With the right upgrades to your car, you can handle these dangers. Without them, you may not finish in the top 3. In order to progress in the challenges, you need to finish in the top 3 in each race. If you finish first, you not only get more money, but you also get a prize. Prizes are free parts for your car. This can save you money and can allow you to get certain upgrades more quickly as not all upgrades are available from the start. Besides the normal challenges, there are also sprint races and battle races to choose from. Play all these races in single player, or linked with up to 3 other players. Or, connect to the GameCube with Road Trip- Arcade to unlock more content. The game tracks all your parts that you have acquired, completed races, race results, and more.</story>

    <story>Based on the Blue Sky film (distributed by Fox) of the same name, Robots takes players on an adventure to save Robot city. When Rodney Copperbottom travels to Robot City to meet Big Weld, the famous inventor, he finds that something is wrong. Big Weld is missing and the evil Ratchet has taken over Big Weld Industries. With the help of his friends the Rusties, Rodney puts an end to Ratchet&apos;s villainous ways and restores order to the city. Robots uses a unique perspective that combines 2D side-scrolling with 3D views. The game takes the player to locations from the movie like Robot City, Big Weld&apos;s Mansion, the Outmode, and Madame Gasket&apos;s Chop Shop. Using the invention mode, players build and upgrade Rodney&apos;s weapons including the wrench, scrap gun, electro zapper, and magno grenade. With a combination of navigation, jumping, and combat skills, players can make their way though the world of Robots and bring an end to Ratchet&apos;s tyranny. In addition to the main story line, players will find robots in need all over the city. The parts these poor robots are missing can be found hidden in the numerous maps and returning the correct part rewards the player with power-ups and weapon upgrades. All of the maps are interconnected, so players can easily find their way back to a previous area to uncover additional secrets.The maps are connected with a transit ball mini-game, just like the transit system in the movie. The DS version of the game features a map that can be annotated by the player, a unique 3D version of the transit ball game that utilizes the stylus for control, and 3D menus. In addition to the new features, the DS also includes high resolution maps that include more detail than the GBA version.</story>

It&apos;s a one-on-one fighting game where the player takes control of a robot inside a boxing ring and battles against other robots.

It&apos;s also possible to do charged punches by holding down the attack button. Once one of the robots has lost all of its health, a concussion mini game is started. Here the player can perform a finishing move by alternately tapping the L and R buttons. Three game modes exists. The classic mode where the player can choose to play as either the Red Rocker or the Blue Bomber is a one-off game. In the versus mode it&apos;s possible to choose from some additional robots as well as some different arenas. In the title fight mode, the player starts out with the Red Rocker and then has to unlock the other by winning the fights against them.</story>

Now, it is up to Sabreman to traverse the land in pursuit of these villains; and to retrieve the eight pieces of the amulet. The game is separated into two modes of play- the 3D exploration mode and the 2D platforming sections. The 3D exploration mode is how Sabreman gets around the eight different themed worlds of Sabre Wulf. While there are no enemies in this mode, there are plenty of people to talk to, who might help you in your quest. Also strewn about are more than fifty 2D platforming levels, which you can access through the wulf&apos;s head tunnels. The point of the 2D levels is to get the Wulf&apos;s treasure through a mixture of platforming and puzzle solving. Sabreman can jump, but he can&apos;t attack on his own. That is why he&apos;ll need to use the abilities of the fifteen different creatures found in the game. The creatures&apos; abilities range from offensive power to getting Sabreman to a higher ledge. Learning when to use these abilities is essential to navigating the Wulf&apos;s Lair, and claiming the treasure as your own.</story>

    <story>When bounty hunter Jenosa Arma takes on a mission to investigate Planet Inos, a research center investigating an alien lifeform called Scurge, she gets more than she bargained for. While in orbit around the planet, she is attacked and quickly infected with the Scurge herself. Jenosa has no alternative but to land onto Inos, to investigate the Scurge and find a cure. Scurge- Hive is an action game with some similarities in storyline to Nintendo&apos;s Metroid series. However, the game itself is significantly different from Metroid. As Jenosa, players must blast their way through Planet Inos while trying to constantly contain their own infection. While progressing through the game, Jenosa&apos;s &apos;infection meter&apos; slowly increases (faster if she is standing on red patches of Scurge) - the meter can only be reduced back to 1% by using a Decontamination Platform, which also acts as a save point. Failing to temporarily cure Jenosa of the Scurge results in rapid depletion of life as the virus takes over, so players must complete mission objectives quickly! Jenosa can earn experience as she blasts infected life forms; this experience will upgrade her firepower and health. Better weaponry can be found, as well as gadgets which help Jenosa access new areas. Some weapons are twice as effective on particular opponents; inversely, they are ineffective against other enemy types. It&apos;s up to you to figure out the best weapon for the right situation.</story>

    <story>Shining Force- Resurrection of the Dark Dragon is a remake of the first Shining Force game. The story still revolves around the Runefaust army trying to resurrect the Dark Dragon, but it features some new additions like new characters and additional story sequences in-between battles. Furthermore, dialogues have been expanded and the main hero has a background story now and is able to talk. Graphics have also received a complete overhaul, and the sound quality has been improved, although the compositions are the same as in the original. The heart of the game are of course the tactical turn-based battles. You can take up to twelve different members of your Shining Force into battle. There are many different classes ranging from fighters and magicians to healers, knights, monks, ninjas and many more. In-between battles you can explore various towns to buy new weapons and items or chat with the townsfolk. There are also a number of secret characters and items to be discovered. Shining Force&apos;s gameplay has also seen some changes. The interface has been slightly simplified and you can now organize your units before battles. During battles, it is now possible to view upcoming turns, which makes it much easier to plan your next steps. To make the battles more interesting, even for fans of the original, you receive certain bonuses (usually money or a weapon) for completing battles in a set number of turns. Finally, a card-collecting side-quest has been added. Cards can have various effects in battle and one character is able to transform into the cards that you have found.</story>

    <story>The Dark Dragon was defeated by our hero in the first Shining Soul, and the people rejoiced as the Darkness faded away. People are quick to forget, however. As time passed, people&apos;s lives improved and they forgot about the Darkness. But as the Light grew more and more powerful, it upset the balance between Light and Dark and soon Darkness was on the rise once again. A prophet comes and warns the people of the impending dangers, but no one listens to him. Although his crystal shows the upcoming dangers, the people pass by without any interest. An agent of the Darkness, Gillespie, lures this prophet outside the city and kills him and shatters his crystal so the people remain ignorant of what is coming. This same agent gives the Forbidden Fruit to Deatharte, the trusted adviser to King Marcel in Klantol Castle. The adviser didn&apos;t trust Gillespie, but curiosity is a powerful force. It is now up to another hero to take on the journey to once again stop this growing Darkness. After choosing your character from 8 possible, you start out on his or her way to a tournament being held at Klantol castle. On your way, you meet an adventurer who will explain how to battle. Your journey then takes you to the castle to start the tournament. This tournament is interrupted when the king finds out his daughter is missing. The king&apos;s adviser heads out to find her, and the king asks that you go as well. It is here that your story really begins. The gameplay is similar to most RPGs of this type where the monsters are fought in real-time. An interesting part of this game is that your resistances will increase when used. Outside the castle, you can stand on a fire that will not damage your HP, but as your resistance reacts to the fire, it will increase slowly. Traps will also increase your resistance if you are hit by them, though you will also be hurt. Only the one fire is safe. Take on many monsters, cast spells, get new equipment. But most of all, save the world from Darkness.</story>

All the regular Shrek crew is included, such as Shrek, Donkey, Fiona, and Puss n&apos; Boots, along with some newcomers such as Cap&apos;n Hook, the Black Knight, and Quasimodo the Hunchback. Each character has their own special moves that capture the humor of the franchise (such as Shrek&apos;s Green Storm gas bombs), and the environments are colorful, filled with odd weapons, and highly destructible. Players have the option of following a story mode (where Donkey tells his half-breed Donkey kids a strange bedtime story), or just participating in straight-up brawls or minigame-like challenges. Multiplayer, of course, is a big focus on the game, and it allows up to 4 players to slam each other all day long.</story>

    <story>In the Game Boy Advance version of Shrek the Third, you must complete levels playing as a combination of Shrek, Prince Artie, Puss in Boots, and Donkey. The levels are mostly puzzles, where you can only access certain areas with a certain character, so all playable characters must work together to all reach the end. Each character has special abilities, such as Shrek&apos;s ground pound to break through pits in the ground. You will encounter many different AI types throughout gameplay, including evil witches, arrow-shooting guys, gnomes, etc. There are collectible faeries in each level that you must collect enough of to progress to the next world. This is a simple platformer-puzzle game that is mostly geared towards children, seeing as there are no lives, and relatively simple combat, but it should also appeal to adults who enjoy the Shrek franchise.</story>

    <story>Welcome to Strangetown! The Sims 2 for Game Boy Advance is inspired by the weird town in the original PC game, but this time you&apos;re in a reverse reality show. Daddy Bigbucks (the villain from the game&apos;s prequel, The Urbz) is secretly filming a reality TV show in Strangetown, and pushes your own Sim to mix things up for the cameras. You&apos;ll make friends and enemies, have romances, play minigames (some of which are thinly disguised as fictional commercial breaks), and participate in 11 standalone episodes, each with their own plots and situations. In one episode, you might be dealing with Don Fusilli and his mob, in another episode you might be battling lady bugs after being shrunk down to the size of a bug by a homebrewed cola. Overall, the game is less of a simulation and more of a quirky adventure game through a colorful desert town.</story>

    <story>Snood is a puzzle game based on a simple idea, of the kind that was commonplace in the late 1980s. The game is set out with a grid of small differently-coloured shapes, each featuring faces drawn on them. A succession of blocks are placed in an aiming device at the bottom of the screen, and you must rotate this so as to aim them, off the walls if necessary, to hit ones of the same colour. When 3 or more of the same colour make contact, they are removed from the field of play. Any blocks which were only connected to those blocks (and not to any others or the ceiling) get removed from play as well. This is crucial, because each shot that fails to drop any blocks off causes a meter to move on one level. When this reaches the top, the line of blocks drops by one level. Once it reaches the point where blocks are moved down below the playing area, it is Game Over. There are five skill levels, as well as a set of 50 challenge levels, and a Journey mode in which you play through one level from each difficulty. From medium difficulty upwards, you&apos;ll have to contend with Skulls among the layout - these can only be removed by being dropped away.</story>

    <story>The sequel to Snood keeps the gameplay from the original game but takes it to locations around the world. In this puzzle game players need to line up groups of three or more adjacent Snoods to remove them, similar to the Bust-a-move series. They are launched from the Snood-o-matic cannon at the bottom of the screen. For every Snood launched, the danger level increases and causes the Snoods at the top to move downwards. When the bottom is reached, the game is lost. There are five game modes available- World Tour, Classic, Puzzle, Journey and Armageddon. Four additional bonus games can be unlocked- Snood Ball, Snood Sideways, Snood Grab and Snood Stack, all with small twists on the classic gameplay. Multiplayer is available as well.</story>

As the name implies, you have to kill your enemies with your ball. Football-style tricks of keeping the ball in the air and under control are especially useful - headers and overhead kicks can be played with practice.

Sonic Advance combines elements from the original Sonic series on Sega&apos;s Genesis, as well as from the Dreamcast Sonic Adventure series. Choose from Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, or Amy and take them through level after level of blindingly fast gameplay and ring collecting, dodging enemies in your path towards the final showdown with Dr Robotnik (aka Dr Eggman). Collect Chaos Emeralds along the way to transform into Super Sonic for added speed, and train your Chao to exchange them into Sonic Adventure 2 Battle on the Nintendo Gamecube. And if that wasn&apos;t enough, you can also play 4 player battle modes with your mates, using one game cart between 4 GBA&apos;s.</story>

    <story>Sonic Battle is a fast paced pseudo-fighting game, akin to Super Smash Brothers from Nintendo. Rather than being 3D side-scrolling, this game employs a 3D isometric view- not a static, sprite-based field though, it is comprised of actual texture-mapped polygons. The character sprites are 2D though, and while you think it wouldn&apos;t work- it does -P You can have 9 characters to choose from, 5 modes of play; Story, Battle, Challenge, Training, and Mini Games; you can link up 4 GBA&apos;s to fight your friends, each character has a bunch of moves you can use to beat the you-know-what out of whoever you&apos;re fighting. It has a system of selecting Aerial, Ground, and Guard based attacks, and depending on what type of attack you set for which area (aerial/ground/guard), you have a possibility of 9 total different special attacks to choose from (only 3 at a time in a match though) which you can change each time you lose 1 stock point. Among the other many features, Sonic Team has also made the game more dynamic with the addition of a trainable character whose abilities and techniques you can raise and add to. You get to pick and choose every aspect of the robot&apos;s style (running, attacking, jumping, dashing, etc etc etc etc etc). The game takes a moderate amount of time to play through as all the characters, and adds a longer lifespan to itself if you wish to play through and beat it completely (all characters, get all moves for the trainable robot, etc).</story>

    <story>Sonic the Hedgehog is the first of many games starring Sega&apos;s premier rodent, Sonic. It&apos;s a side scrolling platform game with a difference- speed. Sonic rushes through levels with incredible speed, allowing him to traverse loops and jumps with ease. The plot of the game is simple. The evil Dr. Robotnik has captured many of Sonic&apos;s animal friends, and trapped them inside robots. Fortunately, Sonic can free his friends by destroying the robots with his spin attack. Meanwhile, Dr. Robotnik is trying to control the all-powerful chaos emeralds. Sonic must grab them before he does in the 3D rotating bonus levels. Sonic&apos;s weapon is his spin attack; while jumping, Sonic destroys hostile robots by touch. Throughout the platforming levels, Sonic collects numerous rings. If Sonic is hit by an enemy, all the rings he&apos;s carrying fall out and scatter around; Sonic can quickly grab the rings back before they disappear. If Sonic is hit while not carrying any rings, he dies. Collecting 100 rings gives Sonic an extra life. There is also an invincibility bonus which temporarily protects Sonic from all attacks. The game is divided into several zones, each of them containing three levels. At the end of each zone Sonic confronts Dr. Robotnik in a boss fight. Sonic the Hedgehog is a significant game because it gave Sega it&apos;s first real mascot, and established the Genesis as the video game system with attitude.</story>

    <story>A Sound of Thunder is an overhead shoot-em-up based on the 2005 film, which in turn was loosely based on the classic short story by Ray Bradbury. It is Chicago, 2055, and you are Travis Ryer, scientist and employee at Time Safari Incorporated (TSI), a business dedicated to taking wealthy clients back in time 65 million years and giving them the chance to do the impossible- hunt a dinosaur. Of course, there are dangers- the tiniest change can screw the future up in ways you can&apos;t possibly imagine. Somehow, one of the recent clients has managed to accidentally take a butterfly back through time with him. Soon, the present is rocked by time waves, waves which gradually change the future into how the butterfly-less past would have been. Dinosaurs have been popping up around the city, buildings are crumbling and decaying, and the last wave that hits may mean the end of the human race unless Ryer can return the butterfly to the past. With a nice arsenal of weapons at your disposal, such as grenade launchers, machine guns, stun prods, and time freezing bombs that will freeze all enemies for a short amount of time, plus vehicles such as an ordinary car or a tricked-out ATV, you may just get the necessary edge. You can also battle it out in four-player deathmatch mode or a two-player cooperative mode. You may want to hurry, though- you&apos;re racing against time... and time is NOT on your side.</story>

    <story>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to the Tank. The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier. Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion. And none too soon, because the Invaders are back! Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision. (See Battlezone and Asteroids.) But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari. The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies. You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels. You&apos;ll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth. There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones. You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row. As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots. Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you&apos;ll face a unique boss. If you manage to finish the game, you&apos;ll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</story>

    <story>Brutal Deluxe doesn&apos;t live up to their name - in fact they&apos;re the worst team Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 &apos;legs&apos; with the aggregate score deciding who progresses. You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents. The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are &apos;portals&apos; which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going. You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important. A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team&apos;s power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.</story>

Unfortunately the Bogeyman steals the soles of their friends and turns them into stone - of course the two heroes have to get them back. So they visit the Land of Dead and have to survive a cemetery, a haunted house and the lab of a mad scientist (overall 15 stages). The player can switch instantly (but limited because it costs crystals which can be found in the levels) between the two characters which is often needed to progress in the game- both have distinct advantages and disadvantages. Alicia is disguised as a witch, is strong with the ice element, can attack from a range and doesn&apos;t take damage from long falls. Greg on the other hand is the master of fire, is disguised as imp and has a super jump. Both have also a special attack which also cost crystals to perform. The gameplay is the usual platforming along with fighting enemies. The main difference to the console version is that the whole game is in 2D with different level design and less puzzle elements.</story>

Like in the other versions the the popular TV series The New Adventures of Mermaidman and Barnacle Boy is in danger because the cast has failed to show up.

The levels end with level bosses that have to be defeated in a style mimicking Dance Dance Revolution. Additionally the player can play a variety of mini games in between games.</story>

    <story>SSX Tricky is EA&apos;s follow up to SSX. Tricky features far more storytelling than the original through the use of personality attributes. Rivalries develop between characters with opposing attributes, causing them to act more aggressively towards each other during races. The übertrick system adds a whole new layer to the game. These tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you a nice boost. Performing six übertricks in a row results in a super übertrick, which rewards you with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC&apos;s It&apos;s Tricky to play. Seven tracks return from the original accompanied by brand-new Garibaldi and Alaska tracks. The returning tracks contain up to four times as many shortcuts and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return (Jurgen and Hiro suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by six new ones. The soundtrack will feature mixes by Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite, and the Plump DJs. DVD-like bonuses include behind-the-scenes footage and a making of segment.</story>

Practice is the first, where one player can play any of the events at any time, without going through the rest. The second is the tournament where one or two players sharing the same machine can go through all the events.

Turmoil continues to surround the Galactic Republic, with a renegade Jedi named Count Dooku leading more then a thousand solar systems against the Republic. To make matter worse, former Queen and now Senator of Naboo, Padme Amidalla, is under constant threat from Bounty Hunters everywhere she goes. To help protect Padme, the Jedi Council order Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker to her side. As you enter the story of Episode II- Attack of the Clones, you will control Anakin and Obi-Wan in their quest to find the Bounty Hunter(s) who wish to see the Senator dead. The game follows the script of the movie very closely, allowing you to visit the likes of Kamino, where Jango Fett hides along with the waiting Clone Army, as well as Geonosis, where the final battle takes place. You will also have an opportunity to control Mace Windu, fly a speeder in a 1st person perspective race mode, and use the force powers of the three Jedi to defeat the many enemies. Most of the game takes place in a side-scrolling, platform view, as well as some 1st person levels using the GBA&apos;s advanced semi-3D technology (as seen in Doom).</story>

    <story>Join Anakin Skywalker as he sets out after Count Dooku, who is close to creating the strongest Droid Army ever developed. Not only is the young jedi out for revenge from their last meeting, but he must also foil plans to unleash the Droid Army on the Republic. Graphically similar to Jedi Power Battles (also on GBA), you travel through the many levels from a top down/isometric perspective, allowing you to see all around Anakin. Anakin himself uses his lightsabre as his prime weapon, with a range of force moves available to help him through the strongest of droid challenges. Along the way you will meet with familiar characters from the Star Wars universe, including Jedi Master Yoda &amp; Jabba the Hutt, plus some new faces.</story>

    <story>Based on the events of Episode IV-VI, players take control of Luke&apos;s journey to become a Jedi as he rescues Princess Leia, trains with Yoda on Dagobah, and faces Darth Vader for the final showdown. The game is presented in a side-scrolling format, visiting all of the planets from the series, as well as engaging in a run against the Death Star and a speeder bike chase through the forest of Endor. As Luke progresses, he goes from a simple farmboy to a full-fledged Jedi Knight, learning new Force techniques until he is ready to face Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine aboard the second Death Star. Also included in the game is a multi-player mode where friends can link up against each other to engage in dogfights and mini-games with ships from the Trilogy.</story>

You must fight your way back to Earth in order to warn the human race of the threat that these aliens pose. Gameplay consists of 3rd-person shooting, viewed from behind your ship, with different weapons, weapon upgrades, and shield power-ups, being picked up during each stage. Some stages end in a boss fight, while others simply require you to perform a task, such as shooting all the space mines within a given stage, before moving on.</story>

    <story>The skies are populated by zeppelins, large battleships and flying fortresses. In this age of steel, the Motorhead Empire has conquered and enslaved almost the entire planet. The last free nation, the Republic of Silverhead, tries to bring the Motorhead Empire down using its newly developed weapon, the lightning bomb. Apart from its unusual Steampunk setting, Steel Empire is a fairly traditional side-scrolling shooter. At the beginning of every level, the player gets to choose between a striker plane and a zeppelin. While the plane is faster, the zeppelin has a longer life bar and can therefore sustain more damage. Both ships use the same standard weapon, which can be fired forwards or backwards, as well as bombs that are released automatically while firing. Also available is a limited number of lightning bombs that damage or destroy all enemies on screen. Defeated enemies often drop power-ups, including hearts that replenish health, lightning bombs, bonus points, 1-UPs, options and experience points. Options are small drones that fly alongside the player&apos;s ship and mimic its behaviour. Experience points can be collected to level up the ships&apos; weapons (up to level 20) and thereby increase their fire power.</story>

Honda, Blanka, Vega, Cammy, T. Hawk, Dee Jay, Juni and Juli. Some of the newest fighters on the block include a former Final Fight character (Cody, who has been in jail since the last Final Fight game, or so his clothing suggests), Karin Kanzuki and Rainbow Mika. The major difference between this Alpha and the last two are the new play modes World Tour, Arcade, VS, Training and Entry. World Tour - Simply choose your fighter and travel around the world, fighting the home town heroes that you run into. The more fights you win, the stronger you fighter becomes. You can also learn new moves, and there are three levels of Super moves to choose from before you start each round (called Isms). Arcade - A simple conversion of the arcade version. Beat each fighter with your chosen warrior, in three rounds per match (much the same as past versions of Street Fighter) Versus - Two human players battle it out. Training - A good way to learn all the super moves that are available, against a dummy. Entry - If you save your character during the World Tour mode, you can upload him here to use in the other modes in the game (especially handy for Training). Finally, if you complete certain areas of the game three new fighters become available, including another old favourite in Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma.</story>

    <story>The Sum of all Fears is a first person shooter game reminiscent of the Rogue Spear series. It&apos;s from the same development team and the look and feel is alike, although it&apos;s not as tactical as Rogue Spear. The game&apos;s story is build around the Tom Clancy book with the same title. You take control of a team of elite fighters trained for hostage rescue and anti-terror operations. Each and every team member is the best of the best. The first mission is to recapture a TV station seized by terrorists who broadcast their demands into the world. They have hostages, too, so you need to ensure that no-one gets hurt. But that&apos;s only the beginning of a global campaign against terrorism taking in 11 missions. A training mode and multiple difficulty levels are included. Unlike Rogue Spear, you can&apos;t choose team members or equipment, it&apos;s all pre-defined, from a range of over 15 guns plus grenades . You can&apos;t make your own mission plans either, so it comes down to controlling a team member, shooting every terrorist you see and performing various tasks (disarming security systems etc.). Unlike other shooter games, you can&apos;t survive many bullets, two wounds is usually enough to kill you. However, you then can switch to another team member.</story>

You can get four different Guardian Beasts depending on your choices, each with different abilities. Besides the tournament, you need to gather raw materials to make better weapons by travelling through a large dungeon and battling the creatures you find there in a side-scrolling battlefield similar to Tales of Phantasia.

    <story>You are a male or female apprentice Craftknight and the Edge Fencer. It is your job to protect the seal trapping Goura, a stray summon creature who is too powerful for anyone to control. Similar to Summon Night- Swordcraft Story, your father died 3 years ago. He died trying to trap Goura after a summoner tried to free Goura and take control of him. Now it is your job to protect that seal, while you are working at becoming a Craftknight. A Craftknight is a person who creates weapons and uses them, similar to an armorer. However, these weapons are made with the combined power of your hammer and your Guardian Beast. You will have the ability to choose between 4 Guardian Beasts shortly after starting the game. Each one has different abilities and will have different conversations throughout the game. Unlike in the previous game, you do not learn techniques for making weapons, but instead you use shapestones to create a weapon type. There are 6 weapon types that can be made and you will need at least a basic weapon from each type in order to reach all areas of the game. The actual weapon you create will be determined by the material you use to create it. If you make it with Iron Ore, it will be one kind of weapon, while if you make it with Aqua Ore, it will be another kind of weapon. Later, you will have the ability to upgrade the weapons up to three times each. Battles are the same as in the previous game. You fight in a side scrolling area with up to 4 enemies. You can use your weapon to attack, or use your Guardian Beast&apos;s magic to attack, heal or protect you, or enchant your weapon in some way. Some weapons will also have special attacks that can do even more damage. In this game, you&apos;ll have battles above and below ground, rather than just in the dungeon and arena. You also have the ability to Mono Shift, where you will change into a more powerful being. You can only do this once before recharging the item that allows you to Mono Shift.</story>

The aim of the game, as with the previous titles in the series, is to remove a collected number of coloured bubbles from the game screen. To do so, at the bottom of the screen, you aim and fire the coloured bubbles from a launcher, sending the bubbles upwards into the container. Match three or more together of the same colour to clear them from the screen. If you&apos;re too slow, the collection of bubbles moves down the screen towards you, and the game will end if it reaches the bottom. Classic mode features a number of bubble puzzles previously seen in the Bust-A-Move series, while Normal mode has some new variations on the bubble removing theme.

Once that happens, all blocks above the ones, which have vanished, will fall down and close the gap. Beneath the lowest row, there you see the new row building up. Once all blocks are present, this row will be now the lowest row, while all others are moving up. Once one block reaches the top of the playfield, you loose. Each individual level has a preset value of rows, which will build up. To win a level, all you have to do, is to prevent that a full vertical row (from bottom to top) gets stacked up. The game offers 4 game modes- Traditional, Puzzle, Relapse, and Strategy. Two of them need a brain, while the other two just need a fast hand. Traditional works like explained above. New rows show automatically, with increasing speed not only from level to level, but also in a level. Means- the level starts slow, but in the end, new rows will complete every second. Power-Ups are available in this game mode. Relapse works exactly like Traditional, but with one major difference. The action isn&apos;t just limited to the bottom of the playfield, in fact, both bottom and top now filling with blocks. Power-Ups used on one side affecting both. How to win is the same, but you loose, when blocks from one side touching the other. Strategy is one of the two game modes where you must think. Clicking fast will only help to see the Game Over screen. New rows won&apos;t appear automatically, instead for each cluster you remove, a full new line will appear. So you have to plan carefully before neutralizing a cluster. Puzzle is the game mode, where no new lines appear. Also there are no Power-Ups here. But this is the most complex game mode. Your task is to completely remove all blocks, if at least one block is still available, you loose. There is also no time limit, so you can think as long as you want. The first three game modes offering bonus levels, which works like the Puzzle mode. So, if one block remains, you only scoring the normal points for removed clusters. Only when all blocks are removed, you score the bonus points. There are only two differences- it isn&apos;t so complex, and you only have 15 seconds time. There are 5 different Power-Ups in the game (2 good, 2 bad, 1 depending of the situation)- Platform Block (won&apos;t move, just blocking the vertical row where it is), Indestructible Block (does move like a regular block, but can&apos;t removed with normal actions), Color Bomb (one of each of the 5 colors, will detonate all same colored blocks in it&apos;s big radius), Super Bomb (shorter range than the Color Bomb, but blow up all blocks, regardless the color; only way to remove Platform/Indestructible Blocks), and finally, the Gravity Block (only available in Relapse Mode, will shift all blocks from the side where it was activated to the other side).</story>

    <story>Mario and his brother Luigi are back for this second Super Mario Advance title- the first being a remake of Super Mario Bros. 2. The brothers, along with Princess Peach, are vacationing in Dinosaur Island. Then when they least expect it, Bowser once again kidnaps Peach and takes her to his castle. On the way to rescue her, the plumbers find Yoshi, who tells them that Bowser has also turned his friends into eggs. So the Mario brothers, with the help of Yoshi, must rescue the princess and Yoshi&apos;s pals. Mario and Luigi can run and jump through each level. They can also collect power-ups to gain new skills. The Super Mushroom makes them grow and gain more defense. The Fire Flower lets the brothers throw fireballs to defeat enemies. The Starman makes them invincible. The plumbers can gain the ability of flight with the Cape Feather. Yoshi can help Mario and Luigi if they find an egg. The green dinosaur can use his tongue to eat enemies or grab power-ups. He can walk across certain enemies with his shoes. Yoshi can eat differently colored Koopa shells to briefly gain more abilities. For instance, the blue shell gives him wings, red shells let him spit fireballs, and the yellow shell allows him to stomp the ground. This update over the original Super Nintendo version includes character speech (as heard in Mario Advance and Mario Kart Super Circuit). Up to four players can compete in the classic Mario Bros. game, included with the main game.</story>

Colored gems fall from the top of the screen in pairs, but this time lining up those of the same color is not enough. To break the gems and punish your opponent with counter gems you have to place a crash gem of the same color next to the gems. If you make a block of gems of the same color they&apos;ll fuse, forming a power gem. Breaking a power gem sends more counter gems to your opponent than breaking the same amount of gems in some other configuration. But the ultimate attack is breaking power gems in chain.</story>

    <story>Super Robot Taisen- Original Generation 2 is a strategy RPG in which players lead a small force of mechs in a fight to save humanity from an alien invasion. The designs of the mechs, pilots, and attacks are heavily influenced by anime. The combat system of this game is similar to its predecessor. The player controls multiple mechs and issues commands in a turn-based fashion. Each mech pilot has spirit commands that can be used to strengthen a mechs abilities such as its hit or dodge rate. After moving a unit, the player is usually given the option to attack an enemy with an attack from a list. After all of the player&apos;s mechs have been moved, the AI gets a turn to move its mechs. If a player mech is attacked, the player has the option of counter-attacking, attempting to evade, or defending. Super Robot Taisen- Original Generation 2 does include a few minor changes to the battle system. For one thing, a new attack type (known as a chain attack) allows a unit to strike multiple enemies in a single blow. Also, the AI has been vastly improved. The graphics of Super Robot Taisen- Original Generation 2 have been enhanced from the graphics of the original. Attacks from mechs now have a more fluid motion and are generally more interesting to look at. The game&apos;s story picks up six months after the original Super Robot Taisen- Original Generation left off. Most people on Earth are still trying to recover from the battle with the Aerogaters, but a small remaining faction of the Divine Crusaders is still trying to further their goals. Once again, it&apos;s up to the SRX and ATX teams of the EFA to put a stop to their activities and restore order. However, they are soon interupted by two new groups of mysterious enemies- the Einsts and the Inspectors.</story>

    <story>In Tales of Phantasia, you play a young boy named Cless, who lives together with his parents in a quiet village. It was a day like all the others when Cless decided to go hunting with his best friend Chester. Chasing a wild boar, Cless discovered a strange talking tree in the forest who was pleading him for help. But as soon as it stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound of an alarm. They returned to the village and found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants murdered. Before Cless&apos; mother died in his arms, she told him this terrible massacre had something to do with the pendant she and her husband gave Cless for his birthday... what connection could there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle who lives in another town, but he doesn&apos;t realize his journey will take him to much more remote places than that! Tales of Phantasia presents a unique combat system- The battles have a lot in common with fighting games- you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an overall strategy for your allies.</story>

    <story>Tiger Woods is back for another round of golf in the 2004 edition of the best selling pro golf series. The biggest addition to this version is EA&apos;s Game Face, which lets you customize everything and anything. You have the basics, such as hair, skin, facial hair and other general appearances, but Game Face allows you to customize every other aspect, from teeth shape, logos, tattoos, headbands, hats, and more. You may also change individual body mass, muscle tone, mid-section, arms and legs. You also have the option of choosing specific swing style animations, post-putt and celebration animations, and pissed off animations for when you score a triple bogey. One of the new modes is World Tour, which puts you through a standard 52-week PGA tour to earn money, sponorships, and better gear. You can play for up to twenty seasons. The other new game mode is Battle Golf, where you can win an opponent&apos;s clubs if you beat them. All the other standard game modes are here, from Skill Challenge and Speed Golf to a Skins Match or Practice. A new feature is the game&apos;s ability to read your console&apos;s internal clock, and provide you with game modes. If it&apos;s near the end of October and your clock is properly set, you may be invited to a Halloween event where you can win items specific to that event. All top PGA players are included for you to play as (or against), including Vijay Singh and Justin Leonard. Newcomers to the sport have also been added, such as John Daly. Most of the courses from 2003 have made it, with seven new courses, both real and fantasy. One of the new courses is Bethpage Black, an extremely difficult course located in Washington. Like all other 2004 EA Sports console games, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 has the EA Sports Bio, which tracks your accomplishments and games over all EA Sports titles. The more EA Sports games you play, and the longer you play them, will increase your EA Gamer Level and unlock additional rewards, such as a new driver in Tiger Woods or historic teams in NHL 2004. This feature isn&apos;t on the PC version. Gamers who buy the PlayStation 2 version will be able to play online through EA&apos;s matchmaking service. You cannot play online with the Xbox or GameCube versions. If you buy the GameCube version, you can use the GameBoy Advance to hook up to the GameCube to unlock special rewards not available through normal play.</story>

The game of golf is simulated to an accurate level and is both compelling and frustrating, just like the real thing.</story>

    <story>Halloween Town is preparing for this year&apos;s Halloween, and Jack Skellington is sure that this one will be the best ever! However, Oogie Boogie has other plans - furious that he has no holiday of his own, he commands Lock, Shock and Barrel to kidnap Jack so that he can take his place as the King of Halloween and claim the holiday for himself. Unfortunately, the trio kidnap Sally by mistake. Angered by their bumbling, Oogie Boogie releases thousands of bugs into Halloween Town, sending the citizens into hiding. It&apos;s up to Jack to save Halloween Town...and his holiday! Tim Burton&apos;s The Nightmare Before Christmas- The Pumpkin King is an action-adventure game similar to Castlevania- Circle of the Moon. The game is set before the movie The Nightmare Before Christmas, before Jack&apos;s encounter with Santa Claus and Oogie Boogie. The game takes place in one gigantic overworld which Jack can explore. As he earns new weapons, such as the Frog Gun and Bat Boomerang, he can unlock new areas and access more of the overworld. Early in the game, he&apos;ll also find his ghost dog, Zero, who can help by finding secret areas and navigating through small spaces. The game also features three mini-games that can be played either against the computer, or versus up to three friends. There&apos;s &apos;Bone Breaker&apos;, where you must be the first to smash the skeleton, &apos;Whack Hammer&apos;, where you must smash as many rats and bats as possible, and &apos;Skulldigger&apos;, you must find the correct box with the Shrunken Head.</story>

    <story>Cowabunga! Take control of your favourite turtle ninjas as you play through the events of the 2007 CGI movie. The turtles have grown apart, and Raphael has taken to crime fighting solo under the guise of the Nightwatcher. The Foot Clan are turning up in the streets again, and a mysterious man known as Winters seems to be involved with them. Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets! The Game Boy Advance version of TMNT can be best described as similar to the NES game River City Ransom. Players take control of either a specific turtle or the turtle of their choice (depending on the mission), and fight through waves of enemies in a sidescrolling beat-em-up style. Enemies will drop the usual health pickups, but also drop money and weaponry. Money can be used to purchase weapons or upgrades between missions, while weapons can be used as a more powerful tool to defeat your foes (however, these weapons have a limited use). After the completion of a mission, experience is earned, and after a certain amount of experience is gained, you can level up the turtles to improve their fighting statistics. Each turtle has their own specific weapon- Leonardo with his dual Katana, Michelangelo with his Nunchucks, Donatello with his Bo Staff and Raphael with his two Sai. These weapons are used in their standard attacks. A basic attack is performed with the B Button, but you can perform different attacks with B and other buttons such as the directions of the Control Pad and the A Button. Uppercuts, Sweep Kicks, Jump Kicks and more can be performed, and you can even juggle enemies in the air to get more hits in and increase your score.</story>

In Career Mode, choose from one of 13 professional skaters and, in each level, complete various goals like collecting items, performing special tricks and of course breaking high scores by performing tricks and combos. Completing the goals earns money which unlocks new levels and can be spent on new boards, tricks and upgrading your skater&apos;s stats. In competition levels, you don&apos;t skate for money but compete for a medal. In the Free Skate and Single Session modes, unlocked levels can be practiced and new high scores be established.</story>

    <story>THPS4 is the fourth game in Activision&apos;s ever popular franchise. The main feature of this game is it&apos;s redesigned career mode. When beginning a level, you have all the time in the world to skate around, perform tricks, get a feel for the level, without the hassel of any goals or time limits. When you&apos;re ready to attempt a goal, simply find a pro skater, talk to him, then receive the goal, similar to Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX. Goals are similar to the previous games, such as collect SKATE, get a certain amount of points, transfer over this and grind that. There are new goals, however, such as collecting the word COMBO while doing one big combo. Miss a trick, and goal fails. Once all regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt the Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, and is extremely hard. All the major skaters are here, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie Thomas. The levels are been expanded and are huge. Some of the levels include a college campus, a shipyard, and the infamous prison complex Alcatraz. For multiplayer, all the favorite modes are back, from Graffiti and Trick Attack to Horse and King Of The Hill. New modes include Capture The Flag and Combo Mambo. THPS4 also supports System Link play, but not XBox Live. The PlayStation 2 version offers everything from the XBox version, but also has online play, utilizing either your own network adaptor or the official one. The PS2 version also features a one level demo of Shaun Murray&apos;s Pro Wakeboarder, which is not featured on any other version of the game.</story>

In quick race, players can alone, against another human player or create custom courses for the game. This is further divided into versus games against the computer and time attack. The game can also connect through mobile phones to check global rankings, enter local ranking entries, and download ghosts and new courses. In the championship mode, players need to complete the courses in a fixed order while a ranking is kept. The cars are shown from a third-person perspective and there are different AI-controlled racers to beat. Prior to the races, players can do free runs, qualify and eventually start the race or tune the car further. There are two weather types, sunny and rainy, which affects the handling of the cars. There are different cars and courses to choose from, with extensive tuning options based on the gear ratio, steering, brakes, tires, aerodynamic settings and the height handicap. There are also three difficulty levels.</story>

    <story>Top Gun- Firestorm takes the player to the skies again in twelve missions where numerous aerial and ground based enemies need to be fought to arhieve victory. The story is very loosely based on the movie of the same name. The player guides the well known pilot Maverick through a series of realistic training missions to receive graduation from the Top Gun school. The story is advanced in several stills throughout the game. The player will fly a F-14 Tomcat on an isometric map. He has to complete several objectives in each mission. To achieve those he has four different weapons at his disposal (machine gun, bombs, rockets and missiles). The gameplay is somewhat similar to the Strike series.</story>

Choose from four up and coming riders, and compete in the Ibex, Glyder and Kotsu Leagues to become the ultimate champion! Trick Star is a futuristic racing game where the racers ride slick one-wheeled bikes. Players race along the track, with the goal of not only coming first, but also performing stunts to impress the crowds. Stunts cannot be performed until a certain speed is reached, and the Trick Star appears on the HUD. When it appears, players can perform a stunt by holding L or R, as well as any direction on the Control Pad. Performing stunts also fills your boost meter - when it is full, you can press L and R simultaneously to get an extra boost. In League Mode, players must complete three tracks, as well as scoring enough points to qualify for the Challenge Mode. Once the player has enough points, they can enter Challenge Mode, where they are asked to perform a particular set of stunts in between markers. When they succeed, they are rewarded with additional stunts and progress to the next set of tracks. Trick Star also includes one player at a time multiplayer, for up to four players. Players can compete in Time Trial (aim for the fastest time), Stunts (get the highest stunt point score), Long Jump (jump the longest distance along the track) and Challenges (complete the required challenges). After each player has had a go, the results are shown.</story>

There&apos;s seven different levels in total and includes a jungle, volcano and a space station. There&apos;s a number of power ups or items available that are necessary to complete a challenge. First of all the player ha to fins keys to unlock doors. These come in different colors that have to match. Some tiles have arrows on them which force the player in the direction they face. To overcome this the player can use his turbo speed. Some of the ground is weak and can collapse when rolling over it. Often the player will come across gaps. For this there&apos;s a build item and a jump item. There&apos;s also gravity and wind which drag or push the the player. The turtle&apos;s shell can be upgraded in three ways. There&apos;s a glide shell which allows the player to go faster over slow ground, the panzer shell which allows the player to pass through force fields and the spike shell which allows the player to get a better grip on slippery ground such as ice.</story>

Gameplay is classic arcade, with one button to pass, another to juggle the ball and another to shoot. One of the key aspects is the State of Grace; by making fancy moves (such as overhead kicks, heel passes or heading the ball back and forth) and scoring goals, a power bar starts filling, and when it&apos;s full, all team attributes are maxed up and the players are given the ability to quickly run with the ball.</story>

    <story>Next to versions on consoles and Nintendo DS, Ultimate Spider-Man was also adapted for the Game Boy Advance. It follows the same basic story as the other versions (reducing it to its bare necessities and changing many details) and presents it as traditional 2D side-scroller. The game is a follow-up to the Venom storyline from the Ultimate Spider-Man comic series. Three months after his apparent death, Venom is back and causing trouble. Spider-Man finds his home neighborhood of Queens besieged by a gang of thugs while a group of mercenaries have set their sights on capturing Venom. The game&apos;s storyline is illustrated by comic-style cutscenes, with many of the images re-used from the DS version. The game consists of seven parts called issues of three chapters each. As in the other versions of the game, players will control both Spider-Man and Venom, both of which have different abilities. To take out the many enemies, both have various attack moves at their disposal, which can be strung along into combos. Both can also stick to walls and ceilings and pull themselves up (Spidey using his web, Venom using his tendrils). Spider-Man can additionally use his webbing in various other ways, like immobilizing enemies by throwing a web ball and swinging across obstacles. His web fluid however is limited and must be filled up by collecting appropriate power-ups. Power-ups are also needed to refill his health. Venom on the other hand cannot find power-ups even though his health constantly drains. He instead has to feed on defeated enemies to restore his health. Some levels feature permanent power-ups- increasing Spidey&apos;s maximum amount of web fluid or unlocking new combat moves. The main goal in each level is simply to find the exit, but there are other objectives that have to be met, sometimes with a time limit. Spider-Man in particular often has to rescue civilians or disarm bombs. A directional indicator displays where the next objective is to be found. Several of the levels consist purely of boss battles.</story>

Starting out as a humble window washer, the player is quickly embroiled in a devious plot by the greedy tycoon Daddy Bigbucks to take over the city. The story is much stronger this time around, with the player exploring three colorful city environments, including the New Orleans-influenced SimQuarter, the shiny Glasstown district, the gritty Urbania, and even a haunted bayou inhabited by two creepy Cajun brothers. In addition to the traditional Sims gameplay of satisfying motives, making friends, and decorating an apartment, the player can experience eight job minigames, a xizzle system that lets players learn special abilities, and several new vehicles, including a motorcycle, hoverboard, and fanboat. Combine all that with a wacky sense of humor, and you get The Urbz- Sims in the City.</story>

But what happens instead is that hundreds of Game Boy-like systems are created, with no buttons and an addictive tilt control! Wario&apos;s gonna be even richer than ever before when he sells this! WarioWare Twisted! is the sequel to the sleeper hit WarioWare Inc.- Mega- Microgame$!. It includes a built-in rumble pack and gyro sensor which the games have been designed around. Over two hundred five second games are hurled at the player as they make their way through the stage, trying to figure out what to do with a short description like Play!, Avoid! or Digest!. Each stage has a random game thrown at you, with a short time to complete it. Fail it, and you lose one of your four lives. Lose all four and it&apos;s game over. Pass enough games, and you&apos;ll get told FASTER! and the games start coming at you at a quicker speed. Finally, you&apos;ll encounter a Boss Stage, which has no time limit and is tougher to beat. Each character&apos;s stage is based around a different &apos;theme&apos;. Mona&apos;s games require you to make only a small spin to pass them, Jimmy T.&apos;s games need a consistent rhythm to play, Kat and Ana&apos;s games simply need the use of the A Button, Dr. Crygor&apos;s games involve changing gravity itself, while the Nintendo nerd pair 9-Volt and 18-Volt have a set of Nintendo games which use all of the different styles of play from the other game sets. Twisted! also has a huge amount of novelty unlockables to collect. Once you&apos;ve played through Story Mode, you can replay the games again for a higher score and bonus toys. Whenever you beat a Boss Game after completing Story Mode once, you&apos;ll be prompted to spin to get a bonus prize. This prize could be as simple as a light wand that you shake to see a picture, or a small arcade-style game involving sewing or rolling a cat around the floor while shooting bugs.</story>

    <story>This is an adaption of the arcade game Whac-A-Mole, for Nintendo&apos;s handheld devices. At the screen you have a 5x4 grid of holes (3x3 in the GBA version). As the game begins, moles will randomly pop up their heads in the holes. Now you have to hit them before they disappear again. DS users will use the stylus and tap the moles, while GBA users will have to use the directional pad to move a marker around the screen. The game comes with three different game modes. The first is the arcade mode, were you for each level has to reach a certain amount of points before the time goes out. Different types of mole will show up. In addition to the standard mole, there&apos;s the golden mole which gives four times as much points as the standard one, and the plush one which gives minus points. Later in the game, you will also meet moles that attack your score, for example ninja and bazooka moles. Various power ups are also available. We have the multipliers, which once active will give you double points for each mole, clocks that slows the time and bombs that do the opposite. Seven worlds are available, each with it&apos;s own graphical theme. The second mode is the puzzle mode, which isn&apos;t the same on both platforms. In the DS version you have to recreate a shape that is shown on the upper screen. This is done by tapping moles of different colors. The GBA version has two puzzle games. One is a Tic Tac Toe where you have to hit three moles in a row before your opponent does so. The other is the Peg Puzzle where you have to empty the field from all moles. For each mole you remove, more moles will appear on the screen. The moles will have arrows around them, indicating where the new moles will pop up. However, there won&apos;t come any new moles if there already is a mole in that location. The third mode is a simple quick play mode where you just specify how many levels you want to play and with what difficulty and then try to be successful. The DS version also supports a multiplayer mode.</story>

    <story>Following the Border Worlds conflict of Wing Commander IV, the galaxy is once more at peace. Colonel Christopher Blair, hero of the Confederation has transferred into the Naval Forces. Blair helps design the TCS Midway, a state-of-the-art multi-role carrier that will help keep order during the Confederation&apos;s new peacetime. The luxury of peace allows Confed to retire many older pilots and assign younger pilots to piloting roles. Lance Casey and his friend Max Maestro Garrett are two such pilots, fresh from the academy, transferred aboard the TCS Midway along with several others for its maiden voyage along the borders of Confed Space. But soon into the mission, the Midway intercepts a distress call from the Kilrathi, the remains of a race of cat-like warriors who lost the war with the Confederation... Wing Commander- Prophecy is a space combat simulator. Players take the role of Lance Casey on his new assignment aboard the ship. The player can click various hotspots aboard the ship to engage in non-interactive FMV conversations with shipboard personnel. By entering the briefing room, players can receive full instructions on their next mission. Space Combat begins by launching from the TCS Midway carrier, and are displayed as first-person perspective inside the cockpit, similar to the rest of the Wing Commander series. Mission objectives vary between escort duties, patrol missions, search and destroy or defense of the TCS Midway herself. Depending on the ship being flown for the particular mission, the player will be able to switch between guns, missiles, torpedoes and mines with which to combat the enemy. The player, as wing commander, can give orders to nearby wingmen and communicate with any other ship. After each mission, the player must return to dock with the TCS Midway and will receive a mission performance rating.</story>

    <story>You are an allied fighter pilot in WW1, duking it out with the Huns up in the sky in over 200 missions. The missions usually come in three flavors- Top-down view bombing missions where you have to take out strategically important targets, isometric strafing runs where you get to blast anything that you fancy blasting with an unlimited supply of ammo, and of course the main part- Dogfights in the sky. Rendered in 3D, seems from behind your head. The game is set in the years 1916 through 1918, and to loosen things up a little, we get to read a page of our character&apos;s new entry for the diary-like journal in his company between every mission.</story>

    <story>Winx Club is an action adventure game based on the Italian cartoon series of the same name. The story is similar to that of Harry Potter, only this time the main character is a fairy. She gets to go to a fairy school in fairytale world called Magix where she has to find her true self. This game is similar to the Windows and Playstation 2 versions, except that instead of a 3D third person perspective it features a 2D top-down perspective of the game world. This game loosely retells the story of the first season of the television series. There are action and adventurelevels. In the adventure levels gameplay consists of finding items for specific NPCs and playing various mini-games. In the action levels the player has to jump, climb and fight enemies. The main character, Bloom, has a magic shield and two attacks that improve during the game. She can also cast a number of spells that can aid her in finding the items she needs. During boss battles Bloom changes to her Winx form in which she is more powerful and can fly. During the levels there are various items to be picked up which improve Blooms health or attacks or unlock new outfits that can be worn.</story>

    <story>Inspired by the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein, this episodic first-person shooter (FPS) puts the player in the boots of B.J. Blazkowicz, an allied spy. There are six episodes (the first distributed complete as shareware), the second, and the third available after registration and the three final missions (which happen before the events of the first episode) available in the Nocturnal Missions pack. However, they do not need to be played in sequence to be enjoyed! In the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. was captured, but overpowered a guard with the help of a concealed knife and managed to get out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels the player guides B.J. searching for an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After returning to Allied territory, B.J. is given the instructions to Operation- Eisenfaust, where he has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant prototypes before they are released into the battlefields. The final mission (Die, Führer, Die!) has a simple goal- infiltrate the bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic suit) himself. The Nocturnal Missions are focused on the Nazi plans for chemical warfare, and start with Dark Secret, where B.J. hunts for lead researcher Dr. Otto Giftmacher. It&apos;s followed by Trail of the Madman, where the goal is capturing the war plans guarded by Gretel Grosse, and the final episode Confrontation, where B.J. meets General Fettgesicht, the planner for the chemical assault. Each episode has nine levels (eight regular and a final boss level), plus a secret level activated by an hidden switch somewhere in the eight first levels. Regular levels often feature a maze-like appearance or large areas with many enemies (the number of them on each area depends on the difficulty level), where the player must reach the exit elevator. To do so, he must kill the enemies (while it&apos;s possible to move behind the guards&apos; backs and even there&apos;s a slight bonus in attacking them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt with by fire power), and depending on the level, activate push walls and/or get silver and golden keys to open certain doors. Many objects can be found in a level, from medikits, chicken meals, and even dog food (to restore health), ammo and treasures, which solely exist for points. There are four weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun and Gatling), all of them using the same bullets except the knife. The knife and the pistol are given at the start of the level, while the machine gun is either found (usually in secret areas) or picked up from SS troopers and the Gatling is always dropped somewhere in the level. There are five kinds of enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast, but more a nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers (dressed in regular brown outfit, not very powerful but usually found in large groups), Officers (dressed in white, armed with a very accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS Troopers (blue attire, armed with a machine gun and tough to kill), and Mutants (the rarest and toughest of regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with green clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest). Unlike modern FPS games, the player has a number of lives and once the player loses the last life, the game ends. To win extra lives, the player has to either find the 1-up item in the level or get 20,000 points (by killing enemies and capturing treasures or completing a level below the &apos;par&apos; time while killing all enemies, finding all secrets by pushing walls, and collecting all treasure points).</story>

    <story>Yu-Gi-Oh and friends are here for a tournament hosted by Kaiba Corporation. You must obtain 6 locater cards in order to get into the tournament. To obtain these cards, you must battle various people around the city. As you battle the duelists, you have the opportunity to gain new cards (if you win), or lose cards (if you lose). There is also a card shop if you want to buy cards rather than using only what you get from antes. The battles are played just like the in trading card game. You use your cards&apos; effects and strengths to defeat the other players&apos; cards. By lowering their life points to 0, you will defeat them. A feature in this game is your duelist level. Cards have certain levels on them. If your duelist level is below that number, you cannot have that card in your deck. This is a new feature not seen in previous games. This feature keeps you from just buying all the best cards at the start and having an easy time for the rest of the game. By winning duels, you will gain in level quickly enough to start using some of the better cards, though it will still take some time to be able to use the best cards. Can you get into the tournament and win the 3 Egyptian God cards? Yu-Gi-Oh and his friends are also trying to get into the tournament. So you&apos;ll have to beat them in the tournament to win everything. With over 900 cards and over 100 duelists, you will have plenty to do in this game.</story>

The game also has a text translation utility that will allow gamers who link with one another to translate text automatically between languages. The languages included are Japanese, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and English. These are also the languages you can view the game in. The game continues the tradition of the Yu-Gi-Oh! card battles. There is little to the game other than battling your opponents. This game is a sequel to Yu-Gi-Oh! Worldwide Edition- Stairway to the Destined Duel and offers more than 1000 cards to use as well as new opponents. The game takes out some of the non-card battling features from the Worldwide Edition and leaves you with the battling as the main feature of the game. Build up to three decks with the cards you gain as you work to beat all your opponents. With over 1000 cards, you will have a wide range of choices for your 40-card decks. As with the Worldwide Edition, you can also trade your cards with friends through the Link Cable.</story>

    <story>The Worldwide Edition of Yu-Gi-Oh! is another chance to play Yu-Gi-Oh! on the Gameboy Advance. The main point of the game is to allow you to battle others with your Yu-Gi-Oh! deck. You choose to move to the next area or stay in your current area of the map and battle whoever is there. When you are in the map mode, you have the option of staying where you are and battling anyone in your area who will battle, or moving to an area adjacent to your own. To help you decide what to do, the map will show you the people in your space and the spaces around your space. Depending on what is shown to you, you can easily tell if each person wants to talk to you or battle you. If you have not battled a person yet, you will not be able to see who they are until you choose to battle them (except with a small number of people you already know to start the game). Each week you can get 5 more cards through a magazine that you are given. If you choose to, you can add these to your deck right away. Otherwise, you can leave them in your trunk to be added later. Each weekend, you can participate in a tournament if you&apos;re in the right location that weekend to do so. Winning the tournaments can gain you some new cards by opening up new (locked) booster packs of cards that you can choose from when you win battles. As you get more cards, Duelist Points, or just win many times against a single opponent, you will also open up more booster packs to choose from when winning duels. The game also allows for dueling friends using a link cable, or even trading cards with friends.</story>

To gain control of the planet, they use mechanized robots called Zoids to battle for control of the world. During an experiment, Zoids warriors from different eras, the Chaotic Century and the New Century, collide. Players take control of Zoids warrior Zeru, who wants to restore the chaos with the help of his friends Van, Fiona and Bit Cloud. There are different types of Zoids to choose from, and each one of them can be upgraded and customized. Zeru is given a simple robot and has to participate in tournaments to earn money and collect new ones. He gets to meet Juno who gets kidnapped and a man called Dr. T tells him about the fusion that brought past, present and future together. By fighting in turn-based battles (with up to six-to-six match-ups), the player collects crystals left behind by defeated Zoids that can be turned into new ones by visiting the lab in one of the many towns. There, the robots can be upgraded too in different areas, with defensive and offensive elements, for both long-ranged and melee combat. Prior to each match players define the deck command. This affects the entire team, influencing the cash, salvaged parts or offering the possibilities to fuse all Zoids into a large creature. Each turn offers the player to attack, wait (and regenerate) or use an item. Some Zoids are accompanied by organoids, robot friends, that can fuse into the main Zoid for enhanced abilities. The main story mode takes place in 40 villages with 151 base Zoids to collect. There is also a challenge mode with consecutive, increasingly difficult battles, and multiplayer through the link cable. Except for fighting, this mode can also be used to trade Zoids and parts.</story>

(a giant combat robot) and stranded on Mars, where he joins forces with the Anti-Terrestrial League. Gameplay alternates between Story sequences and tactical turn-based combat in which you control a number of L.E.V.s on a square grid map. There are different types of L.E.V.s that differ in speed, durability, movement range and armament. Unlike close ranged weapons, long range weapons cannot be used after an L.E.V. has already been moved. When two units engage in combat, the I.A.S. (interactive action system) comes into play. When attacking, you have a limited amount of time to move a cross-hair over your target. Critical hits can be delivered by successfully aiming at certain weak-spots of your enemies. When attacked by an enemy, you must try to keep your own target icon away from the enemy&apos;s. The IAS can be toggled on and off in the options menu. At the end of each chapter, you can upgrade your L.E.V.s or equip them with certain items that can sometimes be found during missions. In the balance sub-screen, you can determine whether an L.E.V. should focus on attack power or accuracy, evasion or minimizing damage.</story>

    <story>ZooCube is a puzzle game that involves matching parts of animals to eliminate them and get points. The Cube is a 3D object in the center of the screen and the animal parts fall towards it. In a similar style to Tetris the player must keep the sides from building too high. It is a quickly paced, real-time game and at later stages the player struggles to juggle the cube items to keep eliminating animals on all sides. Power-ups can be used to destroy animal parts, get points, or to make life more difficult for the player&apos;s opponents, such as by speeding up the rate at which animal parts fall to their cube, or reduce how fast their cube can spin.</story>

    <story>The zoo animals have revolted against the zoo keeper. It is your job to restore order and capture all of the animals. In this fast-paced match-up game, players select animals of the same type using either the touch-screen or a standard controller. Line like animals up in rows by swapping them from spot to spot in the time allowed. There are five varied game play modes- Normal, Tokoton, Quest, Time Attack and 2P. Normal mode has you clearing a set amount of animals each level before progressing to the next. Tokoton is similar to Normal, but has all the animal amounts set to 100 before you&apos;ll level up. Quest has you playing ten set stages with specific goals (such as only capturing animals of a certain type) that you must attempt to achieve. Time Attack has you aiming to get the highest score possible in the time limit. 2P has two players battling it out against each other.</story>
