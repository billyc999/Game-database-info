    <story>007- The World is Not Enough is based off of the 1999 James Bond film of the same name. In it, Pierce Brosnan&apos;s Bond must investigate the murder of a British oil tycoon and attacks on his new pipeline, which leads to a larger sinister plot requiring gunplay and frequent flier miles to diffuse. In contrast to the Nintendo 64 and Playstation versions, this game only has eight missions and features a 2D overhead view instead of a 3D first-person. There is no multiplayer, no difficulty levels, and no save feature. Passwords are used to skip to later levels and unlock certain cheats.</story>

While he is on the ground, Alfred can walk, jump, and peck balloons and ground switches. While he is in the air he can dive bomb enemies or springs. Dive bombing enemies will destroy them. Dive bombing springs will bounce Alfred much higher so he can reach platforms well above his normal jumping ability. If he does not hit an enemy or a spring, Alfred will get stuck in the ground for a short time. To complete a level, Alfred must find and peck all the balloons. The last balloon will take him to a boss fight. If Alfred dies, he starts as an egg located at the last balloon pecked. Alfred can receive a few powerups during the game. For one power up, he must answer a telephone in secret areas to make Mr Pekles (a giant flower) give him a pot of jam. The jam gives Alfred the ability to shoot a bomb (about the size of Alfred himself) which bounces around the screen collecting things and hurting enemies. Another power up is a worm that spins around Alfred destroying enemies that it touches. You must find a can of worms to get this power up.</story>

    <story>Aliens- Thanatos Encounter is a top-down action game taking its main inspiration from the second film in the Alien franchise. While usually the goal in any of the more than a dozen levels of the game is simply to survive and find the exit, in some levels certain objectives must be achieved. These may be simply killing all aliens and rescuing all survivors, or finding a keycard to open the level exit. Before each level, the player can choose from five different characters, all rated differently in speed and stamina (i.e. health). Should a marine be drained of health, he or she is not killed, but captured. Another character can attempt a rescue and is given 200 seconds. If the captured soldier is not found within that time span, that character is removed from the roster for the rest of the game.</story>

    <story>A compilation port for the gameboy colour includes 2 classic arcade conversions In Moon Patrol The moon is under attack from a horde of aliens, and you must stop them in your armed buggy. Drive along the surface shooting the aliens and avoiding their bullets. The surface is not flat, there are craters and rocks to avoid contact with, and landmines on the surface. Flying saucers create new craters when they crash. The 25 restart points are letter-coded Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles). At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!). The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.</story>

    <story>Asterix and Obelix (based on the French comic book series), must embark on a journey from the forests of France to the coliseums of Rome. Their goal is to find Obelix&apos;s lovable pet dog, Dogmatix. Players take control of Asterix or Obelix, and run, jump and punch through various well-drawn and colorful levels in this side-scrolling adventure game. This title is somewhat non-linear, and allows players to choose the order in which to visit stages, as well as the numerous mini-games. The stage-select screen is a mini-map, and after selecting to play either Asterix or Obelix, players can visit the boss arena, the inn (extra energy, hints and passwords are found here), as well as the the local mini-game. These mini-games become available from the title-screen under the Instant Fun option. They vary from a Memory style shield-matching game to humorous events such as Throw a Roman Mini Game. Both Asterix and Obelix play differently as they have individual abilities and limitations. Asterix is more nimble, can run faster and jump higher, whereas Obelix is more powerful (being able to bash through some walls) but noticeably slower. These differences are highlighted by the obstacles presented in the stages - there are many jumps to make as well as many enemies (Roman soldiers, boars, centurions) to dispose of. In the quest to find Dogmatix, it is vital to collect keys hidden within the levels to make available new areas. Similarly, it is also important to collect coins from beaten enemies as they allow the purchases at each inn, (which is aptly manned by Getafix himself!).</story>

    <story>Being the predecessor of Asterix and Obelix for SNES, this game features the same story as it&apos;s later counterpart - however the level design was massively changed, doesn&apos;t offer a 2 player mode and level codes were added only for the GameBoy Color version. To show Caesar the power and freedom of your village, you have to collect various trophies from all over Europe. To do this, you can select Asterix or Obelix and move them through various levels while beating up Roman soldiers, collecting coins and avoiding gaps or other obstacles. Various special levels like crossing the sea to Great Britain by boat (and beating up some Romans again) or freeing Rugby players captured by the Romans are scattered across the game and provide variety between the classical Jump &apos;n Run levels. Most levels additionally have a time limit to make things a bit harder, though the difficulty of the game can be adjusted. There&apos;s an overall of four different countries, all of them based on comic books of the series (namely- Asterix in Britain, Asterix in Switzerland, Asterix at the Olympic Games, Asterix in Spain). At the end of each of these stages you have to contend in a contest typical for the country and also taken from the plot of the comics- In Britannia you take part in a rugby match, in Switzerland you have to blast safes, in Greece you take part in the Olympic games and in Spain you have to fight against (or run from) a bull - victory will get you the desired trophy!</story>

    <story>Unlike Activision&apos;s earlier remake of an Atari arcade classic, Battlezone, this one stays close to its namesake. Take the original, Atari coin-op game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 2600 cartridge, then give it 3-D graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you&apos;ve got Activision&apos;s Asteroids remake. You are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation. Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris. The game consists of five zones, each with a different background and some with special features. Each zone has 15 levels. In addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back! And there&apos;s plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids. There are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses. There are also three skill levels. If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship. All ships features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace. There are also limited power-ups you can pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs. The game supports either one or two players. In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level. You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways.... Lastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you&apos;ll find the option of &amp;quot;Classic Asteroids&amp;quot; now appearing on the main menu.</story>

In this game, you control the plucky little porker and direct his sheep management attempts, driving them forward toward the goal in exaggerated, frictionless Soko-Ban or Boulder Dash style with porcine barks until their movement is halted or altered should their course intercept an obstacle such as a fencepost, moveable haystack, pit or trampoline. Babe is given hints and tips in these efforts by lovable characters from both of his feature films, and the 40 levels borrow inspiration both from the calm pastoral setting of the first and the surreal urban folly of its sequel. While the measured puzzles are a far cry from the excitement of the movies, the material finds a surprisingly good fit in this unexpected genre -- or otherwise put, that&apos;ll do, pig.</story>

    <story>Ballistic is a puzzle game in which the player must place 3 patterned balls next to each other in order to clear them. It is somewhat similar to Puyo Puyo in this respect. However Ballistic places the player in the center of the screen shooting the balls outward. In Panic! mode, a constant string of balls appear and the player must keep destroying similar balls to keep the string short and prevent it from snaking around and reaching the middle of the screen. In Checkmate mode, a limited amount of balls are given to the player which they must use to destroy all the balls on the screen. Strategy is used here since the amount of balls destroyed must be maximized. Ballistic also features a versus mode in which players can challenge one another. Similar to other puzzle games versus modes, one player&apos;s success results in additional balls on the other player&apos;s screen which they then must clear.</story>

Visit Barbie and her kid sister Stacey at the Pet Rescue Center, where you&apos;ll wait for rescue missions, explore in the playrooms, or tend to pets in the Care Center. Rescue missions come in over the phone or via e-mail; after learning which pet is missing where, travel with Barbie on her scooter to one of three different environments in which to search for one of eight lost pets. In many missions, you&apos;ll have to figure out how to entice scared animals to come to you, or how to retrieve pets trapped in trees or other sticky situations. If you get stuck yourself, Barbie will give you hints. With each successful mission, you&apos;ll receive a printable Paw &amp;amp; Purr Award that hangs on the Pet Rescue Center wall. Rescued pets come back to the Pet Rescue Center with you and Barbie to wait for their owners and receive a little TLC. Nurse them back to health in the Care Center, where you&apos;ll give recovered pets water, treats, vitamins and grooming. You may also need to bandage a hurt leg or pick burrs from ruffled fur. After creating a file for them in the computer and giving them a name you select from a list of suggestions, the animals go to one of two playrooms to wait for their owners. In the meantime, you can play with them, plus all the other pets already in the playroom--a kitten, bunny, hamster, puppy, and a turtle. Select which animal you&apos;d like to pet, then use the cursor to stroke an animal&apos;s head or back or scratch it under the chin. The animals respond to your attention by licking, rolling over, purring, or barking. There is a related mini-game for each kind of animal--Kitten Keepaway, Puppy Treat Toss, Hamster Trail, etc.--and if you do well enough, you&apos;ll see the animal perform a special trick. A few of the games require the use of logic and spatial aptitude, but for the most part they challenge the players&apos; mouse mastery and hand-eye coordination.</story>

In the first you play on a big game board, where each square represents a Disney character. When you land on a square you play a mini-game against or inspired by him or her. For instance if you land on the square showing the inventor father you will have to play a game where his new log chopping device cuts firewood and he has to bounce it across the screen on a spring. These mini-games range from 2D platform game segments to memory or reflex games. There are a total of seven boards to play on. You can play with up to four players. The second game mode is a 2D platform game where you have to beat bad guy Gaston to the castle to warn Beast from an upcoming mob. There are three levels to play through. You&apos;ll also have to play mini-games from time to time in this mode.</story>

But she makes high demands- her lover needs to be a skilled hunter and fisherman. Two attributes which don&apos;t fit Billy. The only way to change this is by solving a variety of simple mini games, e.g. a shooting gallery or catching worms by walking to the hole and pressing the button with the correct timing. Those mini games can be tackled in any order and when all in a category (fishing or hunting) are finished, the player gets access to the main assignment. This plays out with another, slightly more complex mini game. All this has to be repeated five times with increasing difficulty in order to beat the game.</story>

Competition features a &apos;race attack&apos; mode (basically a speed race with another AI player), Trick Attack (trick points based over 5 courses, beating a course threshold to advance), Time Attack (best time), and Supreme Attack (race with tricks). Challenge modes is about beating any previous records set for a particular track and supported Time Attack (best time), Trick Attack (best trick points), Slalom Attack (time on a flag course), and Vs Race (which uses the Game Boy Universal Link Cable). There is also a practice mode and a &apos;ghost boarder&apos; - basically a replay of the player&apos;s best race. Trick moves include Mute Grab, Nose Grab, Tweak, Stiffy, Indy Air, Tail Grab, Stalefish, Shifty Air, Meloncholy, Frontside Air, Backside Air, 180, 360, 540, 720, 900, 1080, Front Flip, Back Flip, Rodeo Flip, and McTwist; most of which are performed with combo style control moves.

    <story>Disney/Pixar&apos;s Buzz Lightyear of Star Command is based on an animated movie and television series of the same name. Buzz Lightyear is an elite space ranger, who travels from planet to planet hunting down supervillians. In this game, you control Buzz through 14 missions on eight different planets. In each mission, your goal is to race to the end of the level before the bad guy does. If you do so successfully, you face off against the villain, and hopefully capture them. In addition to capturing the villain, there are secondary objectives like collecting robot parts and getting the fastest time through the level. Disney/Pixar&apos;s Buzz Lightyear of Star Command is a spinoff of the Toy Story series of movies. Unlike the Dreamcast, Playstation and Windows version&apos;s 3D view, the Game Boy Color version has a top down view.</story>

    <story>Guide a team of up to four soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this innovative top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once). Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can&apos;t shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</story>

    <story>Motorized carnage. Ever wanted to hit pedestrians during a race? Now&apos;s your chance. Carmageddon is an ultra-violent racing game which caused much controversy during the &apos;90s but was also very popular due to its fun factor. It was also one of the first batch of games to make use of 3D accelerated graphics (using OpenGL and 3dfx Voodoo cards). At the beginning of the game the player only has one car and is ranked at #99. The overall objective is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents&apos; cars on the way as trophies (and possibly replacements to his vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits for the player which can be used for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during the race. If you wreck a certain car in 4 races or so, you get to drive it. There are many power-ups strewn around the courses which range from useful to fun to downright absurd. Though the player can win by racing fairly and normally, most players found it much more fun to wreck everything in sight. Carmageddon is a violent game which is probably not suitable for minors.</story>

    <story>A step back from the Tiger Woods PGA simulation style, Cyber Tiger Woods has a more arcade feel to it, with cartoony style animations, fast gameplay and added elements to make the game of golf more fun then the real life counterpart. Although real life elements are there, including full motion capture of Tiger himself, recreations of some of the best PGA tour courses, and the full range of moves (putting, chipping, driving, etc.), arcade elements such as 2 player battle mode, zany characters including Little Tiger, and game types that have you aiming to knock down the opposing character from his platform above a poll of lava, and you will soon notice how different Cyber really is. Other game types include a full practise range, skins tournaments and stroke play. Plus there are hidden characters to unlock, equipment upgrades and power-ups plus trick shots you just won&apos;t see on the PGA tour.</story>

    <story>Acclaim&apos;s foray into trick-based BMX games spawned a unique version for the Game Boy Color. The basic design is the same as in the original console title and other post-Tony Hawk extreme sports games. In career mode, the player has to complete various goals in each level to advance and unlock further levels. These goals include reaching a certain score through tricks and combos, performing special tricks, or collecting items. The eight levels (shown in isometric perspective) are filled with half- and quarter pipes, ramps, rails and many obstacles to perform tricks on. Two dozen different tricks are available through various button combinations, some of which must be unlocked first by finding tokens in the levels. In training mode, unlocked levels can be practiced without the time limit present in career mode. The game also offers a multiplayer mode, where up to four players can take turns on a single GBC and the player with the highest score or the best trick combo wins.</story>

Velociraptors can cover small gaps in the terrain by jumping, and are able to remove traps and activate nests. Stegosaurs block the other dinosaurs before they fall to their deaths.</story>

    <story>Released in conjunction with 3D versions on consoles, Donald Duck&apos;s adventure on the Game Boy Color is a traditional side-scrolling platformer. The evil magician Merlock has kidnapped Duckburg Times reporter Daisy Duck. Donald Duck turns to Gyro Gearloose for help, who suggests using his latest invention- a powerful teleporter. Unfortunately, Merlock learns of their plans and steals the blueprints to the device. Now Gyro uses the unfinished machine to teleport Donald to various locations, where he is to find the parts of the blueprints, so he may confront Merlock and rescue Daisy. Donald has to face four different worlds, including the forests near Duckie Mountain, the rooftops of Duckburg, and a haunted house. His abilities include jumping on top of enemies to defeat or stun them and double-jumping in mid-air to get to hard-to-reach places. Donald can only take one hit from an enemy (which puts him in a visibly grumpy mood), a second one means losing a life and having to start over the level. Goodies to be collected include various orbs that gain extra lives, restore Donald&apos;s health or put him into Hyper mode. In this mode, he can simply run over enemies to defeat them and also break down barriers to get to new locations.</story>

Kremlings, crocodile-like creatures, include Kritters (they succumb to a simple jump on the head), Krushas (they are virtually indestructible), and others. There are also other enemies that block your path, such as beavers, snakes, vultures. Leading them are dastardly bosses, including Very Gnawty, Necky, Bumble B, and Dumb Drum, and they all bar the way with their own special blend of villainy. Donkey Kong is joined by Diddy Kong- these two primates differ significantly. For example, Donkey Kong is generally stronger; he can destroy most enemies with a single jump and can lift barrels straight over his head to throw them farther. On the other hand, Diddy is faster and not as strong as Donkey; he can run really fast and do cartwheels. Diddy carries barrels in front of him, creating a shield against frontal attacks. The game is split into different worlds, which are split into different levels. Each level contains bonus areas, where one can collect bananas, medallions, and lives. At the end of each world is a boss, which is usually a larger version of a minor enemy.</story>

    <story>Dragon Dance is a Breakout variant with power ups similar to Arkanoid. Like in those games the objective is to destroy bricks with the use of a ball but with the difference that the paddle used to do so here is a dragon which when still curls up in a ball. For every ball that the player loses the dragon will shrink until there is nothing left of it. There is also a time limit for every level so the player can not take too long. Therefore it&apos;s possible to increase the speed level of the ball but there is no way to decrease it except by losing a ball (and restarting with a new one) or by getting a specific power up. Other power ups include those that add extra time or increase the dragon&apos;s movement speed. The player can also transform his dragon into other types of dragons that have special abilities. These become available as the player destroys bricks and is represented by a power gauge at the top of the screen. These abilities include freezing time, deflecting the ball in mid-air, shooting fireballs that destroy bricks and a web that can block off certain paths through the level. Random events featuring dragon gods can happen and will lead to different effects such as earthquakes or restored health. The game consists of one hundred levels with every tenth being a boss level. There is also a versus mode where two players can link up against each other. The players choose one of ten levels and compete in trying to clear the most bricks. For every five seconds the player with the least bricks cleared during that time gets an extra row of bricks added. The one that clears his screen first will win. </story>

    <story>Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game&apos;s hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father&apos;s brave deeds and to defeat Baramos. Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes- soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard. The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters&apos; classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class.

The game, originally written for the 8-bit Ataris, is basically a Defender clone, but popular because it so closely recreates the gameplay of the original Defender, with its speedy scrolling and frantic gameplay. The player is a spaceman with a jet-pack, flying across a barren landscape whose skies are inhabited by a number of different aliens; from the simple Planter to the slowly advancing Blunder Storm or the quick, aggressive Nemesite. Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. You must shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety. This is the Dropzone.</story>

Unlike the Nintendo 64 title of the same name, it features the FIA license for the &apos;99 season with all drivers, teams and tracks that come along with said license. Unlike both the Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast version the Game Boy Color version is completely in 2D, just as its predecessor. Playing modes include- exhibition, Grand Prix, time attack, challenge and match race. The latter is a two player mode which works with a link cable. Like the Nintendo 64 version the challenge mode allows you to replay some critical events in the season. Cars can be completely adjusted (tyres, gears, wings, fuel load) and comes with variable weather conditions. You can change said settings before a race and during pit stops.</story>

So he walks through the ten side-scrolling levels with different background graphics and kills all opposition. Godzilla has six attacks, e.g. a fire breath or a tail whip, which the player has to trigger. Because of his size, there are no variations in movement. Being hit causes Godzilla&apos;s life energy to go down. This is mostly the same game as the predecessor Godzilla- The Series. The only differences are that Godzilla now has to be moved manually to the right, the head attack has a crosshair and the life energy does not automatically refill anymore.</story>

    <story>In Grand Theft Auto, the player takes the role of a small-time criminal trying to make it big with the mob. Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are the way to success. The action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city- Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the big points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple ditch-a-hot-car jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points. Criminal behavior comes with a price of course- if policemen witness a crime, the player&apos;s wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered. The entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items- extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted).

Time travel has already taken place in this reality, however, and Sebatian&apos;s first mission is to use his father&apos;s discovery to return to the past and destroy an earlier time machine, which upset the balance of power in a past war and led to dangerous realities in their present. Just as Sebastian enters the machine to travel back to the past, he watches helplessly as his father is kidnapped and taken prisoner. You play as Sebastian, the soldier sent back in time to rectify the present. Hands of Time features an overhead view and six levels, each of which is comprised of a small overworld with various objectives. Much of the game requires completing item-swapping sequences in order to progress, while avoiding enemy soldiers along the way. You have a small pistol with infinite ammo. You can collect better weapons, though their ammo is limited. There are no difficulty levels and no multiplayer; you can jump to any of the six levels by use of a password system.</story>

    <story>The second Harry Potter role-playing game follows directly on from the first, with mostly the same game mechanics, controls and even some of the graphics. To unravel the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets, young wizard Harry Potter must fight turn-based battles and solve quests. In this game, he is not alone, as a party system was added- his friends Ron and Hermione (and some other characters) will join Harry in the battles. While Harry (as in the previous game) can use card combinations of Famous Witches and Wizards cards to produce special attacks and effects, his friends have other means- Ron can unleash his rat Scabbers in special rat attacks and Hermione, being the know-it-all that she is, influences combat through lecture attacks, using helpful hints like Be Careful! (which increases defense, for example). Gone is the potion-mixing from the first game, but aside from the party system, several other features were added- the Informous spell divulges information about strengths and weaknesses of enemies, which is stored and can be accessed later. To aid in finding one&apos;s way around Hogwarts, floor maps were added. Like the first game, this one also includes several mini-games, including Quidditch, that once found in the game can be accessed from the main menu.</story>

Playing as Harry, one advances through the plot of the book and the movie by fulfilling quests, battling monsters and gaining experience and levels. Combat is turn-based, with Harry being able to use a variety of spells against various critters and other enemies. In addition, card combinations of Famous Witches and Wizards Collector&apos;s Cards can be used to produce powerful magical effects. These cards can be found all over the freely explorable Hogwarts. Potions that refill stamina and magic points can be found, bought or mixed by Harry himself, but only with the right ingredients. As in other Potter games, Harry also competes for house points for Gryffindor, hoping to win the House Cup in the end.

    <story>Harvest Moon 2 GBC is a farming simulation game and the sequel to Harvest Moon GB. The mayor gives the player a free farm. However, the player must become a successful farmer, as the mayor will come to check on the player at the end of the year. If the farm is successful, he allows the play to keep farming a few more years. If not, he gives the player a second chance, because if they don&apos;t get their act together, he&apos;ll reclaim the land and develop it into an amusement park. The player chooses to play as either a boy or a girl, and then chooses if they want a dog or a cat as a pet (the pet choice slightly effects gameplay). The dog keeps other dogs from invading your farm at night, and the cat will occasionally bring items to the player&apos;s house. Livestock includes cows (for milk), chickens (for eggs) and sheep (for wool). A horse may also be eventually obtained for riding and work. The player&apos;s income primarily comes from crops. They are raised from seeds and must be watered every day until the harvest. The player can then sell them. Sometimes plants will produce more than one harvest. Crops can be grown all year long, but a greenhouse must be built in order to grow flowers and herbs during all seasons. Tools can be used to help with work, and include axes, hoes, hammers, watering cans, sickles, fishing rods, pickaxes and umbrellas. Unlike the previous game, there is no dating/romance feature.</story>

You have the ability to buy, sell and take care of farm animals, crops and any other supplies that you may have. You can trade with many of the town&apos;s people, and fellow farmers. If you link up a friend&apos;s Game Boy, you can trade items between players as well. The local stores supply plenty of items to help you in your quest, at a cost, of course. And if you have the time, you can go about the town in search of a little fun away from work. From an overhead perspective, you can explore your farming area, the local town and the Harvest Sprite tunnels, full of strange and wonderful creatures that can help or destroy your quest. There are four seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) and each brings with it new challenges such as keeping arm animals warm during the colder seasons, and supplying water to the crops during the warmer periods. The GBC version includes all new characters and background sprites in full color, but is also backwards compatible with the original Game Boy version.</story>

    <story>Hexcite is a puzzle game played on a honeycomb-like playing field. In the center is a hexagon; six more hexagons make up the entire playing field. Because of the turn-based gameplay, two people can play using only one system. Two-player link mode is also supported. Players begin by placing a geometric shape (triangle, hexagon, parallelogram, etc.) in the center hexagon. The CPU or human opponent then places another shape adjacent (and touching completely on one side) to a previously played piece. Players score bonus points for completing any full hexagon. Much of the strategy in this game is in tricking your opponent into letting you take a bonus. Bonuses are also scored for placing a piece so that two sides will contribute a score. The game is over when all pieces have been played, or if the remaining pieces cannot be played. In that case points are subtracted for any remaining pieces, based on the complexity of the shape (twice as many points are subtracted for a hexagon compared to a triangle.) In Japan, this game has seen several Windows versions, and even has been released as a board game.</story>

Once all the red ones have been collected, you can kill enemies to receive black diamonds. Hugo attacks using his whip - a single hit will stun foes, the second finishes them off. The challenge is in trying to avoid the enemies until you have collected all red diamonds. If you kill them too early, you will only receive coins or power-ups.

    <story>Whereas the other versions of Indiana Jones&apos; first game in nearly a decade are 3D action adventures inspired by Tomb Raider, this edition is different, being viewed from above in pseudo-3D with multi-directional movement. The plot involves Communists attempting to rebuild an ancient time machine, whose pieces are spread across 19 levels. There are largely-switch-based puzzles to solve on each one, and different routes through to completing them. Indy is variously armed with a pistol, machine gun, grenades and his ubiquitous whip. Each level has a password, and ends with a clip advancing the story. As well as Soviets, your foes include scorpions, snakes and jellyfish.</story>

Once again the evil Dr. Claw has brought misery onto the world by unleashing a horrible new virus called the Madkactus virus and it is up to Inspector Gadget, his niece Penny and her dog Brain to stop Dr. Claw and save the world yet again. The gameplay is a side-scrolling action game as the player takes control of Inspector Gadget, Penny and Brain in five different levels, each with four different areas to explore. The player will experience enemies and traps along the way and can use famous devices such as the hammer hat, spring arms and rocket shoes to either elude or eliminate enemies or avoid deadly traps. Along the way, however, Gadget will have to rely on Penny and Brain to reach areas that are inaccessible to him. Both are weaker in attacking, but are faster and can be used to transverse past traps and deactivate them to let Gadget past or solve puzzles in mini-game form in order to advance to the next area. Additionally, players can find power-ups such as muffins which will restore health and GG symbols, obtaining 20 of these symbols will give an extra life. Also MAD symbols will give Gadget three extra lives. Gadget can also pick up weapon items such as plungers, which can pick off enemies from a long distance or nets which can instantly kill any enemies that it comes in contact with.</story>

    <story>This to-go version of Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000 is a top-down racing game, featuring two game modes (championship and arcade), 6 bikers and a variety of tracks in different scenarios. Season mode features 3 championships, each with three stages composed of four races. The goal is to win all 9 gold medals by obtaining more points than the competition. Arcade mode is the same, except all championships and stages, as well as Jeremy McGrath, are unlocked from the start. The difference between championships is the engine size - with larger (thus faster) bikes, the player has less time to react, and going head to head into the edge of the track can be a matter of a simple bump in 80cc to a spectacular flip into the stands in 250cc, also because it becomes a lot harder to do sharp turns in a limited space. While it can be played as a straightforward racing game, by performing tricks the player can obtain some powerups - a bomb will knock down the next opponent, the arrow temporarily boosts bike stats and the shield allows the player to barge into one opponent, knocking him off his bike. There is one big catch - the skull and bones knock the player out of his bike, which can prove to be decisive in a close race.</story>

    <story>The fourth Konami classics compilation includes two sequels- Gradius II &amp; Castlevania II, and two original titles- Antarctic Adventure &amp; Yie Ar Kung Fu. Gradius II- Return of the Hero continues the side-scrolling shoot &apos;em up adventure from the previous title (as seen in Konami GB Collection Vol. 1). 5 levels await, each with a collection of bad guys, end of level bosses, and collectable upgrades for power, speed, attack and defense. You can also practice the first four levels. Castlevania II- Belmont&apos;s Revenge has you returning to battle Dracula, this time as Christopher Belmont. A total of four castles are waiting to be tackled head on in any order you choose. Once they are defeated (each on including an boss), you can then enter Dracula&apos;s castle to take on the big bad vamp himself. Your whip, holy water and the holy cross are the only things protecting you from the undead. Antarctic Adventure is a 3rd person racing style game, where you must race your pengiun through the ice covered levels, past obstacles and other enemies to the end goal before the time runs out. Yie Ar Kung Fu is a one-on-one fighting game, where each enemy you face increases in difficulty. Defeat the five opponents, and then get ready to fight them again at an even harder difficulty level. Throwing stars, climbing up walls and hand to hand combat all come into play.</story>

    <story>This unique RPG provides a world of fishing as the prime objective. There are two modes of play, The Fish and Raise. The Fish- As a young boy, you must search out the fish called Guardian, the only fish in the river that can cure a disease caught by your sister, Teruyo. This mode combines RPG elements such as buying items, talking to the town&apos;s folk and searching the local river for the Guardian fish. The fishing element comes into play when you bait or lure fish at the river, in hopes to find a fish. Raise mode allows you to purchase a fish tank and the extras, and raise a small fish. Much like the many Pokémon type games, you can feed it, keep the tank clean and raise the fish.</story>

    <story>Looney Tunes- Carrot Crazy is a side scrolling platform game featuring famous Warner Bros. cartoon characters Bugs Bunny and Lola Bunny. After finding out all carrots have been stolen from their garden, as Bugs or Lola Bunny the player will have to investigate. Bugs will have to explore the Warner Bros. studio to find out who stole the carrots. Like many platform games you walk from left to right through a level. There are five different worlds which represent the surroundings of characters Yosemite Sam, Marvin the Martian, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd and the Tasmanian Devil. Each world is divided into several levels. The object of each level is to find all film clapboards present. Bugs and Lola can jump and hit things with a mallet (or rolling pin for Lola). They also both feature unique special abilities. Bugs Bunny can dig and move heavy chests and Lola can float down safely from large heights with her parasol. Players can switch between characters at any time. Power-ups in the game include carrots for energy required for special abilities, a super carrot that allows the player to fly like a helicopter (using his ears) and the habanero carrot, which makes the player invincible for a while. If you collect the letters EXTRA during the level you get to play a small minigame where you have to shoot firecrackers at moving targets. Each of the worlds ends with a showdown with the major character of that world. Usually this involves running from a vehicle that pursues the player, while avoiding obstacles.</story>

    <story>You play as Lucky Luke, lonesome cowboy, who draws his gun faster than his shadow. In a received telegram you read that Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Pat Poker, and The Dalton Brothers have escaped from jail. You as a good cowboy and law keeper have to catch them and return them back, finishing 12 levels of the game. Players guide Luke through levels by walking, jumping, climbing and ducking. There are also objects to collect such as dynamite (which can be used to reveal hidden paths), revolver barrels, sheriff stars and other useful items. You also have to use collected items to get past a certain obstacle, such as to show a red cloth to a bull, feed a dog with a bone, and so on. Luke can attack enemies by shooting in straight or diagonal directions. Shooting exhausts the six bullets in your gun&apos;s barrel. To kill the bandits, bad Indians, prisoners, you should shoot at them for a certain number of times. Locations of the levels vary from towns, saloons, and jails, to the prairies, ranches, and Indian village in Cheyenne Mountains. At the end of most levels you have to challenge one of the bosses, and at the end of the final level you should challenge four Daltons one after another again. Some levels are scrolling arcades such as stagecoach traveling, chasing a train, escaping the Tornado or Buffalo, or flowing in the rapids. Also the bonus level is present, where you should shoot all the bottles to get and extra life.</story>

    <story>The third title of the Lufia series gives us an entirely new battle and dungeon system. All of the dungeons in this game are randomly generated, which can get annoying at times. Otherwise, it&apos;s a lot like Lufia 2 in the dungeon department. You see the monsters, they move when you move and you can stun them. The battle system in this game is rather unique. You can use 9 characters in a 3x3 formation. The character in the front row deals the most physical damage, but also takes the most physical damage. Vice versa for the back row one, and the one in the middle row obviously takes and deals average damage. 9 characters might seem like much to use, but you can only let 3 characters attack during a turn; One from each vertical row. The 3x3 system is also used for special attacks and magic systems. Each character has a power in one colour; Blue, green, yellow or red, which means magic, defense, speed or power respectively. The other characters who are in the same vertical or horizontal row also receive the same amount of power from this character; This way, all characters share their power with eachother. Other than that, the story circles around the Sinistrals returning - Again. Another thing that has returned is the Ancient Dungeon, but this time around, it has 200 floors and a very difficult and unexpected boss at the bottom...</story>

Game modes include Exhibition matches, Sudden Death games (first team to score wins), Full Seasons and Playoffs. Progress can be saved through use of passwords. Game features include many known from other iterations of the series, such as player injuries and substitutions, audibles, detailed statistics, control of weather and game time, and more.

The battle sequences are a blend of Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh!. The player battles enemies using a turn-based card system with captured monsters from previous fights and can use certain relics scattered throughout the world to combine with their monster/card to help them defeat enemies and advance. However there are only a certain amount of relics so the player must use careful strategy when using them in battle.</story>

As in an RPG, you choose your character at the beginning, with various strengths and weaknesses, and throughout the course of the game, your character gains experience points through winning matches or playing mini-games. Experience points can be distributed to various skills, such as putting, which makes it easier for you to do well. There are quite a few skills, and no two characters you can create will play in exactly the same way. Although the story mode is the main part of the game, there&apos;s quite a few other modes to keep you busy, like Tournament, Match Game, Stroke, Training, and the two-player mode via link cable. It comes with a dictionary of all the golf terms you&apos;ll need, and an extensive range of statistics on your player.</story>

In addition to the core gameplay found in the N64 version, the GBC version features an RPG-style world that allows you to work your way up through the ranks at the Royal Tennis Academy. The main mode, Mario Tour, has you starting off as a Rookie with low stats. By completing training programs and defeating other students, you&apos;re able to gain experience points, which allow you to boost your tennis stats. When you&apos;re not playing tennis, you can spend time wandering the Academy grounds- talking to other students, or just taking in the sights and sounds. In addition to the main game, there&apos;s also an exhibition mode (singles or doubles) for quick-play.

The game was released in Europe only and is identical to The New Adventures of Mary Kate and Ashley, but with a different license. The same engine was later also re-used in Mary-Kate and Ashley Get a Clue.</story>

    <story>Metal Gear Solid (original Japanese name- Metal Gear- Ghost Babel) for GameBoy Color is not the same game as the popular Playstation/PC installment of the series. It is not set within the storyline of Metal Gear series, but instead tells an unrelated episode featuring the same hero - special agent Solid Snake. A secret government project, codenamed Babel, attempts to revive the Metal Gear project - development of a highly destructive mech weapon. But an organization known as Gindran Liberation Front hijacked the Metal Gear prototype, without which any further development would be useless. Solid Snake is sent to infiltrate Outer Heaven, a location not entirely unfamiliar to him, and to retrieve the prototype. The game is similar in style and gameplay to early Metal Gear games. It is viewed from top-down perspective, and its gameplay is mostly based on stealth. Snake has to sneak past the guards, using various tactics to distract them or to kill them silently. Weapons, gadgets, and moves are all similar to those used in the other Metal Gear Solid game. From time to time Snake will also encounter bosses whom he will have to defeat in order to proceed to the next area. Virtual Missions for Snake are also included in this release.</story>

    <story>Metal Walker is a mechanical take on Pokémon, where the story takes place in the future on an island where a mysterious element called core has been discovered. This core element was used to create a highly advanced race of robots called Metal Walkers that are used for both labor and protection for the people of the island. One day, however, a gang of robots decide to rebel and end up killing a very prominent member of the island. The player then takes control of the son, Tetsuo, with the help of Dr. Hawk and Tetsuo&apos;s Metal Walker in an attempt to hunt down the rebel robots and avenge his father&apos;s death. The gameplay is very similar to Pokémon, where the player explores various areas of the island searching for clues called Data Packets and battling other Metal Walkers or wild Walkers called Metal Busters, but instead of capturing these walkers, the player instead destroys them. Destroying these other Walkers results both in scrap metal and items called Capsules that can be used to upgrade or evolve Tetsuo&apos;s Walker into a more advanced form. Additionally, the player can take the scrap metal to the Junk Shop where they can also be turned into capsules as well. Additionally, capsules can not only contain power-ups, but traps as well that can be used in battles. The battles are also different, whereas this one the attacks consists of rolling attacks that are angled off of the walls of arenas. Additionally, if a player fights multiple opponents, all of the enemies will be present on the screen at one time and if they choose the right attack and angle, can result in multiple hits on multiple opponents. There are also three types of Walkers- Land, Marine, and Sky where, just like in Pokémon, susceptible to the other (ex. Land walkers have advantages over Marine walkers but are vulnerable and weaker to Sky Walker attacks). Base camps can also be built around various areas of the island and can be used for restoring the health of the players Walker. As the player progresses farther into the game, they will encounter over 100 different Walkers, each with their own strengths and weaknesses as well as bosses that have to be defeated in order to access more areas of the island. Players can also use the Link Cable to both battle their Metal Walkers or even exchange their base camps.</story>

    <story>Everyone in Mickey&apos;s home town was getting prepared for a big carnival! Professor Ludwig Von Drake had just finished all the carnival floats and was showing them to Mickey, Minnie, and all their friends. However, spying from his creepy mansion on the outskirts of town was Big Bad Pete, furious at the group enjoying themselves. Soon, he&apos;d gathered his cronies and raced into town, swiping all the floats and decorations. All that was left was a letter challenging them to a race to get their things back. Mickey&apos;s Racing Adventure is an adventure game that centers around isometric racing challenges in various worlds. It&apos;s possible to play as Mickey and his friends, as they explore various parts of Mickey&apos;s town, earning money for car upgrades and finding train tokens to travel to different worlds and challenge Pete and his henchmen to various races. For a fee, Magica de Spell will also conjure up spells for you to use in races and get an edge on your opponents. The first time you travel to a new world via the train, Casey Jr., you must play a special train mini-game. Pete has muddled the tracks leading to the worlds, and you must guide Casey Jr. by shifting the track tiles around so that he doesn&apos;t hit any dead-ends. There are also TNT detonators that you must set off by running into them before you can guide Casey Jr. to the exit. The game also allows you to play as Pluto - while he can&apos;t race himself, he can sniff around town and dig for secrets. He&apos;ll also find hidden tunnels which let you play a Digger-like mini-game where you must either collect all the bones underground, or defeat the other dogs in the area by dropping rocks on them. After completing the objective, Pluto must then head to the exit. Mickey&apos;s Racing Adventure also supports the Game Boy Color&apos;s Infra-Red feature by allowing you to send e-mail to your friends via the Infrared Communications port. Once you unlock the Print Shop, you can also use the Game Boy Printer to print out assorted Disney stickers.</story>

    <story>The Weasels have kidnapped Mickey Mouse&apos;s dog! All that was left was a ransom note with a picture of Pluto being hauled away in a van, and some scrawled writing taunting Mickey to try and catch them. Not knowing what else to do, Mickey called up his friends, who all volunteered to help - even Big Bad Pete plans to race! You&apos;ll have to speed across the country to catch up with the weasels and rescue Pluto! Mickey&apos;s Speedway USA is an isometric racing game that uses the same engine as Mickey&apos;s Racing Adventure. Players can choose from Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy or Pete (and some secret characters too) as they race around various famous cities and landmarks from the United States, including Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon, San Francisco, Montana, and Yellowstone, just to name a few. The Adventure Mode of the game plays out Grand Prix style. You must complete four races in each world, and at the end of each race, you&apos;re given points based on your placing. The player with the most points at the end of the four races wins the trophy for that circuit. There are assorted power-ups that help you as you race, including the Baseball Chucker (a projectile), the Magno Flyer (a homing missile), the Carbo Spritzer (a turbo), and the Paint Splotcher (an oil slick). There is also a Time Trial mode which lets you race any track that you&apos;ve previously unlocked - while you can use it to practice tracks, the goal is to race fast enough to beat the track&apos;s lap time and earn a gold star in every race. Another mode is Professor Von Drake&apos;s &apos;Driving School&apos;. In this mode, you must complete specific tasks given to you, such as parking, reverse parking and slalom driving. The faster you perform these tasks, the better ranking you will receive (again, with a gold star as your ultimate goal). However, you will receive a time penalty if you hit a cone or wall, or miss your parking spot, so accuracy counts as well. Mickey&apos;s Speedway USA supports many of the Game Boy Color&apos;s functions - you can play a two-player link cable race, transfer data from Mickey&apos;s Racing Adventure via the IR Link to unlock a secret, and connect to the Nintendo 64 version of Mickey&apos;s Speedway USA using the Transfer Pak. As you progress through the game, you&apos;ll unlock many postcards and pictures for your album, which can be printed out via the Game Boy Printer.</story>

    <story>6 Puzzle Games designed by Alexey Pajitnov, the original Tetris designer, on one Gameboy Color cartdridge. Jewel Chase. A level based game. Every level consists of a labyrinth of colored pathways, scattered valuables, locked doors, keys, a thief (the player), on some levels an opposing thief and a door marked exit. The goal is to reach the exit to proceed to the next level, valuables can be &apos;stolen&apos; for score. If the opposing (computer controlled) thief reaches the exit before the player, the game is lost. Movement is not possible between differently colored tiles, unless a special, multicolor &apos;bridge&apos; stone is used. 99 levels total. Spring weekend. A rotation puzzle, where a given pattern needs to be recreated by rotating elements on the playfield. Lineup. Using &apos;Tetris&apos; style blocks, a continuous line from a screen border to an opposite screen border needs to be build. Elements appear on an element stack, and can be selected freely from that and subsequently placed anywhere on screen, without overlapping each other. If the element stack is full, the game is over. As soon as a line is complete, the elements of that line are removed from the screen. Elements appear faster over time. Finty Flush. A grid on top of the screen fills slowly with multicolor balls. The player can pick one out of 4 squares on the bottom of the screen to shift balls in one line into and out of these squares. The squares can be rotated in 90 degree steps. As soon as any square is completely full with balls of the same color, its content empties to make room for more balls. 3 filled square grids grant a bonus point, and the next level begins (tiles appear faster). The game is over when the upper grid is full. Color Collison. A &apos;Qix&apos; style ray ( no better way to describe this - for the younger audience - imagine a flapping fan ) moves with increasing speed through a screen full of obstacles. The player can only indirectly control it - any time the direction pad is pressed, it gets &apos;reflected&apos; into the direction that has been indicated. Objective is to hit obstacles with a given color and pattern, avoiding all other elements. To top things of, the patterns change over time. The game ends if the wrong obstacles have been hit too many times. Rat Poker. Little differently colored rats are automatically fed into labyrinths, with labyrinth design changing and getting more complex during level progression. Switches allow rerouting of the rats to arrange certain color combinations (&apos;hands&apos;) of rats. If a given combination is achieved, the contributing rats exit the playfield through a door. You progress to the next level if a given number of rats has been removed from the game. The game ends if there is no space left on the playfield for additional rats.</story>

    <story>Monkey Puncher is a game where the goal is to train a monkey to fight in boxing matches in order to save your kidnapped sibling. You can choose to play as either a boy or a girl character; the one you do not pick is your sibling. Shortly after starting the game you are given your first monkey, Freddy. You can train him in skipping, using a punchbag, doing sit-ups, running and even going shopping. There is also a sixth activity, called sparring. These activities work to improve his speed, power, strength, stamina, knowledge and (for the latter activity) all of these, although only by a small amount. In all of the aforementioned apart from shopping, you train your monkey by getting him to copy your actions; your actions are controlled by the rhythmic pressing of the A button. After a while, your monkey should be able to imitate your actions with ease, eventually being able to start the activity without prompting. In regards to shopping, you can send him out to buy what you want from a selection of items, or just let him go out and buy what he likes. This is a good way of obtaining certain items that are otherwise unobtainable. The rarity of items and the accuracy of which items it brings home from your shopping list increases as its knowledge does. Sparring involves pitting your own monkey against a computer controlled one in order to raise every stat by a small amount. Finally, you can &apos;date&apos; your monkeys, either with each other, with a friend&apos;s monkey or in the dating shop available within the game. This is a good way of obtaining monkeys with higher stats, depending on which monkeys you breed and with whom. During boxing matches, you do not have direct control over your monkey, but in between bouts you can do things such as refill its health, stamina, or both. You can also advise it on what strategy to use against its opponent. These matches are won by either a count or by KO&apos;ing the opponent, however if time runs out before there is a clear winner, the winner is the monkey who is left with the most health at the end of the match.</story>

The game is a platformer with action elements. Each level requires a puzzle to be solved within a time limit, giving the successful player a key to unlock the next level. Bad monsters will attack on most levels, so in addition to moving blocks to get to the key on each level, a player needs to dispatch bad monsters before being killed by them. There are good monsters to meet, several hidden bonus levels, bonus items, and treasure to be found.</story>

    <story>Montezuma&apos;s Return is, in contrast to to the PC game of the same name, not a completely new adventure but closely based on the design of the original Montezuma&apos;s Revenge. While some of the 150 levels are directly ported over, the majority are new. Another major difference is that the camera is closer to the action, i.e. the levels scroll instead of fitting into a single screen.The premise is the same as always- The player takes the role of an adventurer who explores a pyramid in order to steal all its treasures. In each level, the goal is to grab all treasures and reach the exit without dying, which happens instantly when touching one of the numerous enemies or falling from too large a height. Since the player has no attack option besides rarely found daggers, the majority of the game is spent dodging by using ladders or jumping. Other obstacles besides enemies are closed doors which have to be opened with keys, conveyor belts, teleporters, disappearing platforms or the time limit. Power ups grant temporary advantages such as the ability to walk through enemies or kill them by touch.</story>

    <story>Moorhen 3 ...Chicken Chase is a shooter still in the same style as the first Moohrhuhn. The player has a gun and he shoots chickens which fly over the screen. If they are far away, they give more points. After six shots the player has to reload the weapon (which gives a time penalty). The time is limited, the screen can be scrolled left and right and the ultimate goal is to improve the own highscore. In this game the only background is set at a sea. New features are more different animals to shoot, including the Lesshühner which give negative points. Two new ammo types are more powerful but limited and have to be earned by shooting certain things. There are multiple hidden extras to find, e.g. ways to extend the playing time.

The plot basically centers on an Egyptian priest who was mummified in his time and later resurrected in 1926. Now he threatens to destroy the world. It concentrates on exploring tombs and getting the artifacts inside. In most of the 46 levels, the player has access to three protagonists with different abilities- Evelyn can transport items and jump high, Rick can shoot with his pistols to kill enemies or use a sniper rifle to hit far away switches and Jonathan can use explosives. Each of the characters has their own life bars and the player can switch instantly between them. It is necessary to put all three characters to good use to solve the puzzles and platforming challenges the game offer. It is possible to bring a level to an unwinnable state, but there is a function to reset the level without penalty.</story>

Somehow the time machine breaks down, and sends the friends to unexpectedly different time locations. Now it&apos;s up to their friends - Animal and Kermit - to go to these locations and bring them back home. Jim Henson&apos;s Muppets is an arcade game based on the TV program The Muppets Show. Players control either Animal or Kermit to different time locations which hold their friends. There are a total of 6 locations. Players can freely choose the location they want to play. Each location contains 3 selectable levels and an unlockable level (can only be played after finishing the selectable levels). The selectable levels have the same objective- find your way to the goal. The unlockable is where you encounter with a boss and save your friend. Animal fights using his drum sticks, while Kermit throws paper planes at enemies. Enemies (except the bosses) cannot identify the players&apos; character, therefore don&apos;t fight at all. They simply just move from side to side. There are some items that aid players during the game- food (increase health), heart (give players one life), drum sticks (when playing as Animal)/paper planes (when playing as Kermit). Pressing a combination of button can enable Animal and Kermit to use special moves- Animal&apos;s earthquake and Kermit&apos;s super high jump. The graphics are in 2D. Players can save their process by choosing Save in the level choosing menu. At the beginning of a level or when players die, Statler and Waldorf will present exchanging a short conversation about the level.</story>

    <story>NYR- New York Race for the Game Boy Color is a futuristic racing game inspired by the 1997 French film The Fifth Element. Unlike the version for console and PC, the handheld presents the races in a top-down view with less features and options. The game consists of several divisions of 2 tracks each. Only the first division is available from the start, others are unlocked by placing first in all races of earlier ones. At the beginning, only the taxi (as driven by Bruce Willis&apos; character in the film) can be used. Further cars must be purchased with money won in the races (by placing first, second or third). Eight different cars are available to buy, differing in ratings for power, traction and shield strength. The more powerful cars can only be bought upon reaching higher divisions. Progress through the game is stored via passwords. Races are against three opponents, take place on circular courses and consist of four laps. The futuristic hovercars have the ability to change altitude, either driving on the ground or high in the air. Flying high is necessary for maximum speed, but there are obstacles on the track that can only be passed by driving under them. There are also power-ups that can only be picked up when on the ground. These include missiles, shields, speed boosts, slowdown bubbles and short-time invulnerability. An arrow is always in view and points out corners and, when in high altitude, obstacles.</story>

The number of players in the game has increased to 140 and there are now more secret courts. The gameplay is still very similar to last year&apos;s game but the added extras are welcome and makes the game a little more enjoyable to play.</story>

Player taunts (This is MY HOUSE!), unpenalized late hits, and amusing running commentary from the announcers (That was totally uncalled for -- but awfully fun to watch!) all add to the game&apos;s violent charm.</story>

    <story>In 2000 Ubi Soft released two David O&apos;Leary-licensed games. One, David O&apos;Leary&apos;s Total Soccer 2000, based on the PC game with the same name. The other one was a manager game, O&apos;Leary Manager 2000. The gameplay in O&apos;Leary Manager 2000 is not only about the management aspects of football. It&apos;s a bit similar to Sensible World of Soccer, as you can play not only as the manager but also the player. This rendered using an top-down view similar to many Amiga games from the early nineties. In total there is 240 licensed teams from the top two divisions in six European countries. As the manager you get to lay up training schedules, buy and sell players, pick the right players for the right tactics, and a lot of statistics. The game handles matches in three different ways, playing them, watching them or a text-based interface similar to Championship Manager, but with highlights shown in the top-down view. If you don&apos;t want to play through the whole season, you can play single matches against the AI or another player. The manager mode also supports multiple players.</story>

    <story>Pitfall- Beyond the Jungle is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player controls Pitfall Henry Jr. who discovered a portal to another dimension. There he has to beat four worlds with overall 15 levels in order to save the people from the evil Scourge. As with all Pitfall games, the focus is on skillful platforming and jumping. Harry can perform multiple jumping variants (regular jump, long jump, high jump, and a short but high jump forward) which are performed together with the directional buttons and need to be mastered in order to beat the game. Examples of typical obstacles are vines which need to be grabbed mid-air and floating snags where Harry can hook in his axe in. This axe is also the only weapon which can be used to kill the enemies which drain Harry&apos;s life energy when their attacks are successful. The premise is the same as in the PlayStation version, but the rest of the game is unrelated.</story>

    <story>Long, long ago, the sun was covered by a dark and heavy cloud. It was said this cloud was caused by a monster that had sealed the Sword of the Sun. Legends also says that to break the seal, a hero must collect five Power Stones that are guarded by monsters. Bomberman takes up the challenge as he is the last hero strong enough to defeat such monsters. This is a side-scrolling platform game. In each world, you must clear four areas by killing any monsters within. To kill a monster, you drop a bomb. After a few seconds, the bomb explodes in a four-way blast. If the monster is within range of the blast, it is killed. After you clear these four areas, you must clear a fifth area by killing a boss to clear the world and collect its Power Stone. Be careful, though, because if Bomberman is touched by a monster, touches a dangerous item or is caught in the blast of his own bomb, you lose a life. After all lives are gone, you get the option to restart that last area or quit. In most areas, you can, though the placement of bombs, find items to increase your jumping, speed, blast radius, etc.</story>

Before a game, players can select from five different characters, each with different statistics, and select whether they are right- or left-handed. After aligning the ball on the alley, the throwing is done with four consecutive button pushes. The first starts the curve meter, while the second stops it to select the ball curve. The third determines the power of the throw on the power meter, and the final one must be matched to a goal spot for best accuracy.</story>

Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar&apos;s guards, find your way through the Sultan&apos;s palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you&apos;ve got 60 minutes! Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character. The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</story>

    <story>In the world of Puchi Carat, thieves stole the twelve gems that made the people&apos;s dreams come true. They sold them to evil sorcerers who used them to suppress the people. Now, a long time after these events, the gems came into the possession of twelve mysterious characters. Each one of them tries to get a hold of the remaining jewels to fulfill their dreams - some of them seek peace while others want to satisfy their hunger for power. Puchi Carat takes its inspiration from the video game classic Breakout. The player has to clear rows of gems with a ball launched from a cursor that can only move horizontally on the bottom of the screen. In regular intervals, the stones will move one row towards the bottom. Once they reach a line just above the cursor, the game is over. New rows of jewels also appear if the player is unable to catch the ball and it bounces off the floor on the very bottom of the screen.</story>

    <story>Puzzle Master is a falling block puzzle game similar to Columns or Puyo Puyo. It is fantasy themed and the blocks here represents the four elements (water, fire, wood and rock) that have been corrupted by an evil goblin king. As these fall from the sky it&apos;s the player&apos;s job to arrange them so that a cluster of three or more elements of the same type is created. These elements will then be cleared from the playing field. When the player succeeds with doing this his Power Sword gets charged and when it&apos;s fully powered the level is completed. The player fails if the stack of elements reaches the top of the screen. But there are more challenges as some levels have monsters that throw indestructible skull blocks that quickly fills up the playing field. To combat these monsters the player has access to a limited supply of adventurer&apos;s tools. Some of these, like daggers and bombs, do direct damage on the target that it&apos;s dropped on but can also be used to help clearing the elements. Daggers will take out an entire column of elements while hearts act as a wildcard and potions remove all elements of a sort from the playing field. There are also keys that can be used to unlock chests or get access to new areas of the playing field. Some special puzzles exist too for the player to figure out. For example dropping a water element on a flower will give an extra tool. The game three modes- quest, time challenge and training. There are more than fifty levels split over five different realms. The fifth realms is only made available if the player succeeds in completing the first four and collects all the ancient objects.</story>

Typical Mission goals would be centered around clearing the screen of all elements, but hitting certain targets on the way and making sure that there is still a route to the exit. If the player reaches the exit with all mission objectives complete, the next level is introduced by a password. Playtime per level is up to 20 minutes and there are 150 levels. The first 20 or so levels introduce all game elements one by one. There are various extras, allowing to manipulate puzzle pieces, remove blocked routes and so on, as well as special blocks such as teleporters (beaming you around the playfield), or ice (making direction changes impossible) etc. The basic principle is like memory, i.e. two equal looking puzzle pieces need to be found and are then taken of the playfield. To do that the player can &apos;clone&apos; the blob, and send his alter ego to connect the blocks occupied by the main character and the clone.</story>

To do this you guide Q bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off the board while Q bert is safely transported to the top. </story>

However, the whole screen is filled with dirt which is removed by simply walking into it; clearing a walking path for the monsters with the deadly touch. Brian&apos;s main weapon is his magic staff which shoots a powerful blast, but needs to recharge for a while before it can be used again. An alternative weapon are the chests which stand around the levels and are subject to gravity- digging the dirt under it causes it to fall down. A chest to the head is unhealthy for both Brian and his enemies. There are also power-ups to collect, e.g. higher speed or more firepower.</story>

    <story>Rampage World Tour is a updated version of the classic Rampage. Rampage World Tour starts off at Scumlabs International where three lab technicians, George, Lizzy, and Ralph have mutated in an accident involving toxic waste. George has turned into a gigantic ape, Lizzy a gigantic lizard or dinosaur, and Ralph some sort of gigantic wolf. The three destroy the lab they previously worked at and then embark on a path of destruction encompassing the entire globe. The player chooses one of these three characters and begins destroying buildings, eating civilians, knocking planes out of the sky, and stepping on tanks. The ultimate goal of the game is to rid the world of Scumlabs by traveling to the cities where they are located. Being creatures of such massive size, there are many cities that must be destroyed along the way. Scumlabs and the various militaries make it a priority to destroy you and optionally another player that can play simultaneously. The graphics are worth noting as they are of a unique, colorful cartoon flavor. Gameplay includes players climb buildings while punching, kicking, and eating their inhabitants to destroy them. Once all the buildings for a particular stage have been destroyed, the stage is clear and players proceed to the next stage. Players can get many different kinds of power-ups that make them more powerful or restore health.</story>

    <story>Razor Freestyle Scooter is an extreme-sports style action game modeled around small, nimble scooters. In contrast to most games of this type, there is a story. A crazed giant robot has kidnapped your skating buddies. By completing skating challenges at the robot&apos;s sky fortress, you must rescue your friends. You skate around 3 large areas and attempt to perform wild tricks, collect scooter wheels, and earn bonus time. By completing an objective on all 3 areas, you unlock a sky fortress level in which you can rescue a new skater to control. Gameplay is based heavily on the Tony Hawk series of games. Tricks consist of button and direction presses, and can be strung together with grinds to create high-scoring combos.</story>

One S.T.A.R.S. member, Leon S Kennedy (from Resident Evil 2) was sent out to destroy the weapon, but the team have been unable to contact him since he arrived at the ship. Using a combination of top down side-scrolling action and 1st person shooter, it is your job to get aboard the liner, currently floating in the Atlantic Ocean, destroy the weapon and find Leon. Along the way, you&apos;ll come across plenty of deadly undead enemies, similar to those found in the original Resident Evil series, while using a range of weapons and items found in the ship.</story>

The four opponents can shoot at each other and the goal is to finish the race first. In this mode a password is rewarded after every victory. The round courses sometimes allow alternate paths. Deathmatch focuses on the shooting part. The opponents (the number can be set beforehand) move freely over the course (without the boundaries from time trial) and the last one standing wins.

    <story>Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows. By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you&apos;re knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race. Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.</story>

    <story>Play as the child Cody, whose grandpa has just retired and is leaving him with the family business, a Robopon Dispatching Company. The player starts with one Robopon, named Sunny, and must travel Porombo island as he/she collects Robopon and uses them to battle other Robopon Collectors. The collectors primarily played against are known as the Legend 7, who are the top-ranked collectors of Robopon on the island. When Cody beats a Legend 7 member, he takes their rank. To improve Robopon, they must be upgraded by adding software or other parts to them. Each part has a certain amount of space for storing software and will determine what attacks can be used by the Robopon. Software can be mixed to generate special attacks. Ultimately, Robopon plays a lot like Pokémon. Fighting is turn based and is between two Robopon owners who tell their Robopon to issue attacks or go on the defensive. Robopon can be healed in mid-battle with spells (which can be bought in town shops or stumbled upon between towns) or taken to a Robopon dispatch center and healed in their machine. One thing where Robopron differs from Pokémon is that in battle, a defeated Robopon sometimes will drop add-on items which get claimed by the winner. When a new game is started, the game asks for the player&apos;s birth date which is actually used by the game to select the first Robopon the player will start with. </story>

    <story>Roswell Conspiracies- Aliens, Myths &amp; Legends is a game based on the animated TV series of the same name, basically X-Files for kids. The player takes the role of Nick Logan who has the unique ability to see through alien disguises and accompanies him during his work- catching aliens to save the world. The gameplay principle is simple- the player walks through 15 levels with a fixed camera perspective and shoots everything he sees, e.g. werewolves or vampires. To do this he uses one of the many weapons he finds - all of them have unlimited ammo but have to regenerate energy during pauses of fire. But the player doesn&apos;t kill his enemies for good- He has to catch them with his alien trap (which is a matter of pressing one button) or they regenerate. Besides the shooting the game also features its share of puzzles, e.g. activating a mechanism, and bosses. There is also a mini game which comes into place whenever Logan has to disable a bomb or open a lock- basically a series of quick time events where the player has to press the correct button with the right timing. The levels are divided into five areas- London, Ireland, San Francisco, a Maya temple and Roswell.</story>

Around the park you will find various points of interest where you can play one of the eight side-scrolling platform levels or seven mini-games. Advancing to the new platform levels requires you to collect tickets which are won through playing the mini-games. Mini-games include target shooting, fishing, shooting hoop, tossing frogs and hammer shot. The events are displayed on a single screen. The platform levels have various themes such as clouds, rocket ship, a gooey world, a haunted mine, a volcano, a pyramid, a pagoda and the Notre Dame. The goal of the game is to eventually find Chuckie a princess to become his new mother.</story>

    <story>The Rugrats Movie is a traditional 2D platform game based on the 1998 movie of the same name, which in turn is based on the Daytime Emmy-award winning animated television series. In the game Tommy Pickles&apos; little brother (Dil) has vanished without a trace and it is up to the Rugrats to find a replacement baby for Dil Pickles. The game features eight levels including Pickles house, the hospital, woods, and ancient ruins. There are two levels in which you drive the Reptar Wagon in a top-down perspective, but the rest features standard side-scrolling platform gameplay. In each level the player has to collect specific items and get to the exit before time runs out.</story>

    <story>Sabrina is no newcomer to computer gaming, and this is her second appearance on the Game Boy Color. Sabrina Spooked is aimed at 6 to 9 year olds, so the basic story line is straightforward- Sabrina and her faithful cat Salem follow their aunts through a magic portal; there they discover that the Spooky Man--a baddie, of course--has kidnapped them in order to steal their magic powers, along with those of the world&apos;s other witches and wizards. Sabrina sets out to foil the Spooky Man&apos;s plan, using a range of spells across four different gaming worlds. The game takes a platform format--you move around and over obstacles, knocking out the enemy on the way. Zapping presents is a good idea, as this reveals goodies such as extra health, spells, and lives. Each level has an exit portal that&apos;s only opened when you&apos;ve found three crystals. When Sabrina gets to a portal she has to survive a trap set by the Spooky Man. There are no shortcuts to getting this job done. You can switch between controlling Sabrina or Salem. Salem is quite small, making him very useful for getting through tiny spaces--but he can&apos;t defeat enemies, so you need to think carefully about when best to use him. </story>

Gameplay consists of positioning characters close to objects in such a way that a menu at the bottom of the screen lights up. The player can then choose the correct action (examine, search, use, take) from the menu. There is also plenty of dialogue involved.

    <story>Until now, Scrabble has generally been reserved for days when you&apos;re stuck inside during the British summer holidays when it&apos;s raining. But the little game with the letter tiles has made it onto the Game Boy, so now you can have all of that scrabbly goodness in the palm of your hand. As well as the standard game--where you get some letters, make spellings up and then shout what do you mean there&apos;s no such word as QXZYJHD?, there is also a conundrum round where you and your opponents get the same seven letters and have to arrange them into a word. You can play against up to three other players (either computer players or friends--although you&apos;ll all have to use the same machine as the game doesn&apos;t make use of the link cable). If you play against the computer you can choose a difficulty level--Novice, Easy, or Hard--and the pictorial representation of the opponent changes depending on which level you play, from a man with a dunce&apos;s hat to the expert who looks like Einstein. It&apos;s a nice touch which gives you the impression of playing against someone rather than just the computer AI. There are also various options you can choose to spice up play- you can set word challenge to on so that your opponent can dispute a word you put down (otherwise the dictionary will do it automatically when you place your tiles; the intelligence of this changes as you go up difficulty levels), and you can also turn off the miss a turn function when you get a word wrong. It&apos;s very simple to pick up and play, and the board is reproduced in the original colours. Basically, this is a very addictive game for people of all ages.</story>

Starring in the titular role of Shamus, you will have to find your way through over 120 rooms in this cross between Berzerk&apos;s robots in a maze action and Adventure&apos;s exploration of a predefined game world. The elusive villain&apos;s henchmen will express their disapproval of your plans in rather strong terms, namely with showers of bullets. What&apos;s more, once they&apos;re dead they don&apos;t necessarily stay that way- each time a room is re-entered, a random selection of them will respawn. The Shadow has also arranged for electrified walls throughout his compound, so bumping into them will prove quite lethal. The labyrinth of chambers is divided into four levels, with multiple locked doors that&apos;ll have you wandering around in search of the right keys. If you tarry too long in the same room, a bulletproof Shadow (taking a page from Evil Otto&apos;s book) will drop by to discourage loitering.</story>

    <story>This is a portable edition of the solitaire game Shanghai, the game uses traditional Mah Jong tiles. The aim of the game is to match tiles, four of each type will be put on the playing field, when two tiles are matched they are removed when none remain you win. Only tiles that can be moved freely to the left or right may be matched. A wrong move may result in you not being able to clear the field. A slight story mode is presented in the Shanghai mode; each tile setup is based on a Zodiac animal that needs it power restored. The goal is to complete all twelve of these stages there by restoring the animals power. Some variants are also included- 1. Kong Kong- Compete against a computer to clear tiles. If you go slowly you will have tiles sent over to your by your opponent. This type of play is similar to games like Puyo Pop. Kong Kong may be played against another player by using a link cable or against a computer. 2. Challenge (WonderSwan only)- A large Shanghai game that you&apos;ll try to race through to get the best score. 3. Goldrush- In this mode you will race against an opponent to reach a tile marked &apos;G&apos;. G is for GOLD, boy! So get cracking.</story>

The premise is odd, but fits well with the license- the Simpsons were out in Bart&apos;s tree house telling scary stories on Halloween night. As the night wore on they fell asleep and fell prey to the spirits living in Bart&apos;s tree house. Now each member of the family must fight through his or her nightmares to return to reality. The game re-creates tales from the annual Treehouse of Horror Simpsons episodes. Each member of the Simpson family has his or her own levels, including Marge in a zombie tale, Maggie as a fly, Lisa fighting cannibalistic teachers, Bart rescuing his dog in a haunted house, and Homer as a vampire killer, a robot, and Homer Kong.</story>

    <story>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to the Tank. The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier. Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion. And none too soon, because the Invaders are back! Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision. (See Battlezone and Asteroids.) But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari. The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies. You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels. You&apos;ll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth. There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones. You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row. As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots. Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you&apos;ll face a unique boss. If you manage to finish the game, you&apos;ll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</story>

    <story>The Burai, a race of evil super-brain aliens, have launched their plan to conquer the universe with their army of half-organic, half-robot creatures - the robo-mutants. It&apos;s up to the player to stop them! Strap on your jet pack, and get ready to become the ultimate Burai Fighter. Space Marauder is an scrolling shooter game with two modes of play. Most levels are side- and vertical-scrolling with pre-designed layouts. A few levels are different, though- top-down perspective, with a randomized layout. Either way, the player is armed with a variety of weapons, including different guns (laser, missile, ring) and the powerful cobalt bomb which kills everything on screen. Space Marauder is the Game Boy Color version of Burai Fighter. Game play is exactly the same. Like Burai Fighter it offers the same three difficulties (Eagle, Albatross and Ace), but the game features different level layouts. It doesn&apos;t include the Vs. mode.</story>

    <story>Space Station Silicon Valley is a based on the Nintendo 64 game of the same name. It keeps story, gameplay mechanics and even the basic level design while translating everything into a platforming perspective shown from the side. The story is about a space station which is populated by independent robot animals. A while ago the station vanished but now it is back on full collision course towards Earth. Of course humanity sends squads out there to end the threat, but everyone but the robot Evo gets lost. The player takes the role of Evo who has to solve 35 levels in order to save Earth. The unique characteristic of the game is that Evo has the ability to take control over any robot animal he meets. In fact, he is required to do so because his life energy rapidly decreases when outside of a host. All those animals have different abilities which are used to solve the numerous puzzles found in the levels. There are varying goals to complete in each level which range from destroying a machine to guiding sheep to their pens.</story>

    <story>Based on the popular Todd McFarlane comic book, Spawn sends the titular hero through four stages of combat. He must navigate various environmental obstacle while defeating enemies with his fists and guns. Spawn is a platformer with some shooter elements. It contains both horizontal and vertical sections. You must make your way through these and defeat the various thugs and occasional bosses. Mostly, you&apos;ll be punching and kicking, but there are some guns with rather limited ammunition to find along the way. There is also one stage where Spawn rids a motorcycle, somewhat along the lines of the surfing and skating levels in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. There are three difficulty modes. In each mode, enemies can take more damage. One punch will knock out any minor enemy in easy and you can start at any stage. It takes two in normal and you must play through from stage one. On hard, it takes several, so the fighting becomes much more strategic. You must beat the game on hard mode to get the real ending.</story>

    <story>Speedy Gonzales- Aztec Adventure is a side-scrolling platformer based on the Looney Tunes cartoons. Sylvester the cat has kidnapped all mice from Speedy&apos;s village and Speedy has to free them. The focus of the game is on platforming and, as Speedy&apos;s character dictates, running through the levels at a high speed. There is also the occasional enemy to fight with weapons (smoke bombs, boomerangs, etc.) which have to picked up first. Other extras to pick up include extra lives, extra life energy or speed enhancements. There are six levels in total with three stages each (some of them spent in a boat or underwater) and one boss per level. </story>

The game is a platformer, divided into several large levels. Progression is not strictly linear- some of the levels can be freely explored in any order before continuing with the story. Locations include the city, subway and sewers, the docks and a warehouse. The levels are usually crawling with enemies that Spider-Man can beat up with kicks and punches. Defeating them will eventually result in him gaining levels, becoming stronger and learning some new fighting moves. Spidey&apos;s special abilities come into play when he swings freely over the rooftops, clings to walls or throws web balls at enemies to immobilize them. His spider-sense will usually alert him when important locations or special obstacles are near. The game includes various boss fights with the likes of Venom, the Lizard and the Hobgoblin.</story>

    <story>Spirou- The Robot Invasion is a 2D side&apos;scrolling platform game based on the Franco-Belgian comic Spirou et Fantasio. Fantasio bought a strange mechanical device. When he brings it home and thoroughly inspects it, it turns out to be a malevolent robot who subsequently escapes from the house. Soon a villain called Cyanide appears to be involved and the entire town is crawling with evil robots. It&apos;s up to the player (as Spirou) to set things straight! Armed with a maul you have to trash the robots. Controls are similar to other platform games- you can walk, jump, attack, use a switch and grab a ledge. You&apos;ll have to solve simples puzzles such as pressing switches to open doors. You can pick up items that restore your health or unlock bonus levels. The game also has a UBI key that allows you to unlock a secret level, and can also be used to unlock secrets in other Ubi Soft games. The game is presented in comic strip style much like in Comix Zone, where you move from frame to frame, each divided by a white border.</story>

But there&apos;s a snatch, another spy is also on the same mission. Players have to sweep him out of their way and collect the items before he does! Players have a choice among four locations and between Black Spy and White Spy. Each location contains a certain number of levels, which all have the same objectives- get the briefcase, collect the four items and get to the exit door. Players can try to slow their competitor down by killing him by placing traps in the rooms (dynamite, coil, spring, bucket and a time bomb) or using weapons (fists, knife and stick) when encountering him. When getting killed, players will be redirected to the starting point and all collected items are lost. Players are provided with a map which shows how many rooms there are and what is inside each room (trap, players&apos; counterpart, items). Players can never be killed off entirely. The game is only over when the counterpart gets all the items and escapes through the exit door.</story>

The new moves available for each fighter, called Super moves, allow them to fire off very powerful moves. A bar at the bottom of the screen represents the power that you have to use for the moves. You start the first round on 0, and each attack that you make adds power to the bar. Once you reach level 3, you can unleash the special attacks, that can sometimes KO the opponant. The other major change over the Street Fighter 2 series are the Alpha counters. These can be used to counter an on-coming attack after blocking.</story>

    <story>Super Breakout features similar gameplay to the original, but with several new game variations. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the bricks at the top of the playfield. To do this, you need to use the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep a bouncing ball within the playfield. There are four different game variations included. The first is &apos;Breakout&apos;, and plays the same as the original game. This leaves three new gameplay concepts. In &apos;Progressive&apos; the brick walls will slowly drop towards the bottom of the screen and the ball moves progressively faster and faster. When there&apos;s room, a new layer of bricks will appear at the top. The other two games add a second paddle. In &apos;Double Breakout&apos; you have two balls to keep in play and score with. In &apos;Cavity&apos; there is a single ball in play when you start, but two additional balls trapped within the bricks. These are freed when their surrounding bricks are destroyed. </story>

With no family or friends, he must fend for himself on this strange, seemingly uninhabited island and ultimately find a way to return home. Survival Kids is presented in an overhead action-RPG style similar to Link&apos;s Awakening. Players must try to survive through each day by getting enough rest, eating food and drinking water regularly. This can be risky, as certain foods such as mushrooms can have varying effects including paralysis and poison, while other foods can go rotten and make you sick if you eat it. The game also features a unique merge system, which allows you to create a number of different items by combining two other items. For example, combining bark and a stick would produce kindling, while using ivy with a bent stick could create a bow. There are plenty of useless items that can be made in addition to the essentials, so it&apos;s up to the player to think as to what could be helpful in their quest to survive.</story>

    <story>The third game in the off-road spin-off of the Test Drive series received an adaptation for the Game Boy Color. It offers eight licensed off-road trucks from manufacturers like Jeep, Dodge, Ford and Subaru and seven international areas to race in, each with three different tracks. Further cars and tracks are available as hidden bonuses. Races are seen from a top-down perspective. The modes are similar to those in the developer&apos;s earlier Test Drive 6. The main gameplay mode is Tournament Mode. Seven different cups are available that have to be taken on in order, unlocking tracks in the process. Winnings from races can be spent to purchase new cars. After every race, power up points are awarded that can be used to improve the car in acceleration, top speed, traction and gearing. It is also possible to equip the car with a GPS, which provides a map of the track during a race, and with further enhancements, the locations of all drivers. Also available are power bursts and power winches. Bursts give a short speed burst, while winches can be used to quickly reset the car to a checkpoint if it becomes stuck at an obstacle like mud or water. Single Race mode allow players to race on unlocked tracks with their purchased cars. In Patrol Chase mode, players can select from special cop variants of three different cars, with the goal being chasing down the other cars on the track and giving them tickets by ramming into them. The game cartridge has a rumble feature that lets players experience all the bumps and rough terrain first-hand.</story>

    <story>The Adventures of Tintin- Prisoners of the Sun is based on the Belgian comic book of the same name. The basic plotline is the same- Professor Cuthbert Calculus gets kidnapped and the player, in the role of Tintin, needs to rescue him. The rest is more loosely adapted- in contrast to the comic, which is mostly based in Peru, this game offers many different locations all over the world. The gameplay itself is a typical platforming action- Tintin walks through the levels while avoiding the enemies. Pretty much everyone, e.g. little girls and security guards, is out to hurt Tintin who has no means of defending himself. This means the most important aspect is learning enemy placements, their patterns and how to avoid them. But he has to hurry because of the time limit. Required for success is the usage of the two playing plains- from the player&apos;s perspective in the foreground and further towards the background. Tintin can switch between the two at any time.</story>

    <story>The Game Boy Color version of the original Tom Clancy&apos;s Rainbow Six game scales back the 3D visuals of the original game in favor of an almost top-down view, but builds on the same premise of the player controlling a member of the Rainbow counterterrorism unit, responsible for resolving hostage situations and neutralizing threats, in sixteen missions. The limitations of the platform are not traded in for an arcade-like approach. Just like the major computer version it stresses careful planning and tactics. After a briefing that needs to be followed attentively, the player assumes the role of the commander and assembles a squad of eight operatives, each with different statistics and abilities, based on character traits such as aggression and self-control, physical elements such as stamina, and specific skills including stealth, firearms, electronics, demolitions and many other types of weapons. They can be divided into up to four independent teams. Next, the operatives are outfitted with a selection of six different rifles, six different handguns, 24 types of armor or camouflage and additional tools including heartbeat sensors and door charges. Default equipment is suggested right away, but that is not sufficient for later missions. In the planning mode, the last part of the pre-mission activities, the commander needs to set out waypoints on the map and determine the course of action. The actual missions are shown in 2D where the different characters can sneak around, blow up doors, rescue hostages and engage the enemy, all requiring a tactical approach. The general plot points and mission objectives are true to the computer version.</story>

You perform tricks to achieve a high score. Race mode is viewed from a top-down perspective, where you goal is to perform tricks and get to the end quickly.</story>

    <story>The Game Boy Color version of Tony Hawk&apos;s Pro Skater 2 is based off the console game of the same name. Instead of exploring a 3D environment, however, players perform tricks in 2D side-scrolling levels. Players can select their skater and board, each of which has their own unique stats, allowing you to choose the combination that&apos;s perfect for you. Each of the thirteen different characters even has their own signature tricks to perform.</story>

    <story>Tony Hawk returns with an all new line-up of skaters, an all new line-up of parks to crash through, and a whole new level of graphics. The line-up of street and vert riders include Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Steve Caballero, Rune Glifberg, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Eric Koston, Chad Muska, Bucky Lasek and Bam Margera from MTV&apos;s Jackass (and Tony Hawk, of course). The create a skater mode returns, allowing for even further levels of options for your character, like adding glasses and tatoos to changing the colour of the knee and elbow pads or even the hair. And the levels themselves that you must skate through are now more interactive, with cars and humans blocking paths and making noise as you race around to make as many points as possible. Use items around the streets or the park to jump from or over to increase your score, and pull of as many wild and wacky tricks as you can.</story>

Granny sends off Tweety on a world trip to gather paw imprints of 80 cats in order to win a bet. There are overall 40 levels with ten scenarios, i.e. two cats per level. The levels itself are relatively open and have to be explored in order in order to find the cats, especially by using Tweety&apos;s flutter ability. The player has to tap a button rapidly in order to keep him in the air longer. On the other hand, he has no standard attack and has to use items found in the levels, e.g. banana peels or acorns. The cats have to be overwhelmed with those items to get access to their paws. Of course there are also other enemies which take away a part of Tweety&apos;s life energy when touched. There is also a two-player mode in which the participants try to get as many paw imprints as possible in a limited amount of time.</story>

Before he can say I hate Mario, the box pulls him inside and into a room with a dark figure, who strikes a deal with him. Find all of the missing Music boxes and he can leave. And any treasure he finds he can keep. Much like Wario Land 2, Wario can&apos;t die from any attacks by the enemy. However he can change form after certain attacks, which can both help and halt his progress in each level. New forms of Wario include Invisible Wario and Ball of Yarn Wario (an un-controllable ball of yarn, with Wario inside). Also, basic attacks such as swimming and the butt stomp don&apos;t become available to Wario until after completing a certain amount of levels, meaning you have to go back to completed levels to access other areas full of loot.</story>

As Wario, you must clean the place up and take back what you now call your own. In a change from the original Wario Land, Wario is now immortal, to a certain point. Instead of dying when hit by an enemy, Wario loses the coins he collected along his travels in each level. And he can also turn into other Warios. For example, if he is hit by a bee, Wario puffs up into a giant ball of air, and floats up to the top of the level. Only when hit by a sharp object will he return to normal. There are other types, like Fire Wario and Zombie Wario, and each can have its advantages, like getting to other areas otherwise unreachable, or they can halt your progress.</story>

The key to victory is a balanced mix of resource gathering, building, exploration and combat.

    <story>WCW Mayhem is a wrestling game with the official WCW license and twelve-real-life wrestlers to play with. During the matches, the opponents try to perform moves while both wrestlers are close together (basically by holding a direction and pressing buttons with the correct timing) to diminish the opponent&apos;s energy. This is necessary so his shoulders can be held to the mat for three seconds, which ends the match. One speciality of this game is the possibility to leave the ring and fight in the locker room or on the street. Besides the career mode (trying to win the WCW title by passing through lower leagues with lower difficulty) and single matches against the AI, there is also the option to play against another human participant.</story>

    <story>While exploring her house&apos;s attic, the little witch Wendy discovers a treasure chest. Upon opening it, magical stones are released from their prison, and head to a castle which is suspended in the sky. The power of the stones upsets gravity, and the castle comes crashing to the ground, right on top of Wendy&apos;s house! It&apos;s up to Wendy to set things right again! Wendy- Every Witch Way is a combination of a side-scrolling platformer and a puzzle game. As Wendy, players explore the castle in search of the troublesome stones that have upset gravity. Wendy has the ability to control gravity herself – by pressing up or down on the control pad while jumping, Wendy will cause gravity to reverse in that direction. Most enemies and obstacles in the game world are also affected by the gravity switching – you&apos;ll need to manipulate gravity frequently to progress through the game&apos;s different puzzles. Stars can be used to power up Wendy&apos;s magic. For every star that she collects (to a maximum of five), her magic will increase. Beginning with a small weak shot, you can power your magic up to a spread shot that fires in three directions. The stars also act as Wendy&apos;s health meter – if you get hit, you&apos;ll lose a star, as well as some magical power. Get hit when you have no stars left, and you&apos;ll lose a life. At the end of every world, there is a short bonus stage with Wendy riding on her broomstick. In these stages, you must attack enemies and collect stars as Wendy automatically flies to the next world.</story>

    <story>Wings of Fury is an action game with some minor simulation aspects, in which you are the pilot of an American F6F Hellcat plane. The setting of the game is the Pacific during World War II. It is your job to defeat the Japanese by destroying enemy bunkers, machine gun nests and barracks on a series of islands. Barracks and gun nests can be bombarded with regular bombs, while you&apos;ll have to use rockets to take out the concrete bunkers. After a successful bombing run, return to mow down the Japanese soldiers with your machine guns. You also have to sink Japanese battleships with torpedoes and engage in dogfights with enemy fighter planes. You start each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier, which you&apos;ll have to protect from assaults by Japanese torpedo planes. Whenever you run out of fuel, bombs, rockets or machine gun ammo you can replenish those by returning to your carrier. Your carrier is also the place to repair damage to your plane. The Gameboy Color version of Wings of Fury has a toned down violence level. You no longer mow down Japanese soldiers with your machine guns, instead you bombard jeeps &amp; trucks. Also missing in this version are the Japanese torpedo planes and the small 1st-person view window. New are some extra manoeuvres for your plane like a barrel roll and a review of your ammo consumption after each mission. Using less ammo than allocated gives you bonus points.</story>

    <story>The final sequel (at least using the present engine) to the strategy game Worms, Worms Armageddon expands on Worms 2 by improving quite a few facets of gameplay and including play over the Internet through Team 17&apos;s WORMNET. For those who&apos;ve never played Worms, it&apos;s at heart similar to the old game Artillery, which you control an artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit your enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a team of Worms, but not only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep. Everything is presented in a humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves and their cries of triumph or despair, depending on how you do. Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and while an improvement over Worms 2, it&apos;s not a huge change.</story>

There are six levels to choose from as the player will transverse these stages and fight off referees, street punks security guards and even other WWF superstars with a punch, kick, a dropkick or through various weapons scattered throughout the stage such as steel pipes, nightsticks, 2x4&apos;s along with many more objects. Not only does the player have to defeat enemies they also have to avoid various traps and pitfalls such as patches of fire, floor traps and laser cannons to name a few. There are also power-ups that are located in various places throughout the game which can replenish the player&apos;s health and power bar among many others. Additionally, when the player fills up their power bar they can unleash their character&apos;s unique finishing move such as the Stone Cold Stunner or the Pedigree on a selected enemy. There is also an option for a second player to join in using a link cable to team up and help out on their friend&apos;s journey.</story>

    <story>WWF Wrestlemania 2000 is THQ&apos;s first WWF licenced game after making two previous WCW titles. Wrestlemania 2K picks up where WCW/NWO Revenge left off. The graphics are by far superior as well is the animation. Wrestlemania 2K adds three highly sort after features- Cage match, custom entrances and Create A Wrestler feature. Wrestlemania 2K features more than 50 real WWF stars as well as the option for 16 custom wrestlers. All the wrestlers come with their real-life theme music, entrance videos (made into slide shows) and entrance performances. A great improvement over the previous game is the road to Wrestlemania mode, an enhanced tournament where players can challenge for any number of belts and be challenged by other wrestlers in a 12 month journey that finally leads to Wrestlemania 2000 itself.</story>

    <story>Like it&apos;s bigger brother on the PlayStation, X-Men- Mutant Academy on the Game Boy Color is a fighting game starring Marvel&apos;s famous mutants. The character roster includes four X-Men (Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm and Gambit) and five evil Mutants (Magneto, Toad, Mystique, Sabretooth and Pyro). There are also two additional secret characters, whose unlocking codes are revealed upon beating the game&apos;s story mode. In addition to the story mode, in which one character takes on all the others in consecutive fights, there is a training mode, battle mode (featuring teams of three characters each), survival mode (one character taking on all others with only a single bar of health) and a versus mode utilizing the Game Link cable. The Game Boy&apos;s two buttons are used for kicks and punches (or basic mutant abilities like Cyclops&apos; eye beam). During a fight, a rage bar will slowly fill, which allows using powerful special attacks activated through button combos.</story>

    <story>You take control of the X-Men (including Wolverine, Storm, Iceman, Gambit, and Cyclops) and must use the powers of each to fight your way through the many levels of evil mutants, crazy machines and boss characters including Magneto. You can change the character at any time during the game, which is important as your characters power level decreases as you go. When you change a character, the character you take out rests, and the power level increases. Also, some areas can only be completed by using the certain powers of each character. Apart from the normal mode of play, you can also play a second version, where you must fight all of the Boss characters, and if your character runs out of power, you cannot use him/her again.</story>

    <story>Wolverine goes it alone in this action platform title, where you take control of the most famous of the X-Men, and hack and slash your way through 20 levels of enemies and bosses. There are 4 main things that Wolvie can achieve- 1) Hack and slash with his claws (the main attack) 2) Jump (very important to get through levels) 3) Heal (stay still, and he will heal a little at a time. Just be careful, each level has a limited amount of time to complete, so don&apos;t stand around too much) and 4) If you press the attack button (see (1)) several times in a row, Wolvie will go off in a rage. Although hard to control in this state, his attack range improves. He also loses a little health every time)</story>

    <story>Xtreme Sports is a sort of sequel to the earlier Xtreme Sports Arcade Summer Edition, but with altered characters and an actual story. Fin and his girlfriend Guppi are walking by a store window when they see a commercial advertising Xtreme Cola. The commercial announces that an extreme sports competition is being held by the company on Xtreme Sports Island. Excited, the couple decides to enter the competition, each agreeing to do their best to beat each other, but to split the winnings if either wins. However, when they reach the island, things seem strange. A worker says that there are more boats docking than there should be, despite their efforts to keep the competition a closed event. Furthermore, a strange gang called the Bonehead Gang is competing, claiming they&apos;ll take over the island. In Xtreme Sports, there are several different sports, such as skateboarding, in-line skating, street luge, skyboarding and surfing. The player chooses to play as either Guppi or Fin at the beginning of the game. They must compete in various sports in varying difficulties against all the island&apos;s competitors, earning medals as they go along. Medals can also be found hidden around the island. They must also solve the mystery of the Boneheads. There are power-ups in the form of Twitchy Shakes, an energy drink that increases the players abilities. Each opponent specializes in a certain stat, and each area of the island hosts a different sport. This means that each event must be cleared many times to beat each opponent. There is also a practice mode accessible from the main menu.</story>

    <story>In Yars&apos; Revenge, your goal is to destroy the Qotile laser-base which is located on the right side of the screen behind a shield. You control the fly-like Yar, which can destroy the shield piece by piece by either shooting it or running into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn&apos;t completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can&apos;t stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the difficulty and speed of the game.</story>

He&apos;ll pose as a balloon salesman. He just needs to avoid Ranger Smith. Boo Boo- But, Yogi, the Ranger isn&apos;t going to like this. Yogi- Not to worry, Boo Boo, I&apos;m smarter than the average bear! This is a puzzle game requiring strategy. A cloud above will hold several colored balloons while moving left or right. When it reaches the screen edge, it drops down a bit. You have a picnic basket with two balloons attached. By pressing the B button, you can rotate the balloons 90º and swap the colors. By pressing the A button, you release the balloons. The object is to get three balloons of the same color to touch. They will then pop and will be gone. Remember, the cloud is moving so time your release so the balloons go where you want. You are trying to clear all the balloons to move on. Every fourth level is a boss level where you have Ranger Smith on top of the cloud. He stomps the cloud to lower it and drops a stone. If the stone hits your basket, you will release your balloons, whether you want to or not, and will not be able to move for a couple seconds. Once you clear all these balloons, you will have defeated Ranger Smith and will move on to the next area. If you match a balloon with an arrow in it, the cloud will move up a little. If the balloons reach the bottom, you lose. You can then choose to restart the level you were on or end the game.</story>

    <story>Zebco Fishing! is an officially licensed fishing game for the Game Boy Color. It features 11 different lures and 2 lakes to fish on. The player can participate in a tournament and Blackjack Bass. The tournament mode gives you a limited time to catch the biggest fish. In Blackjack Bass you have to catch 21 pounds worth of fish, similar to the game Black Jack. Each time you catch a fish, you get its weight and can decide to hit or hold. If you exceed the 21 pounds you lose. The player can row his boat around the lake until he has found a suitable fishing location, where he can cast his line and wait for the fish to bite. Once a fish is nibbling the bait the player has to hook it and then reel it in. When you do so you must make sure your line doesn&apos;t break by keeping an eye on the tension. Weather conditions, time of day and location all have impact on the chance of catching a fish. Each type of lure also improves the odds in specific types of water and weather types. Somewhere in the two lakes also dwells the legendary Lochness Bass a giant fish which is yet to be caught.</story>
